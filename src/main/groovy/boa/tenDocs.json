I have sent with Gill Davies copies of all the relevant  papers covering the recent discussions here on China together  with a coded explanation of how they fit in to the course of  events.  These papers together with JIC/45/lll o copy of which   you will no doubt be able to obtain from S.A.C .S.E.A. should   give you all that is necessary from the point of view of any   action required. At the same time the situation here was so   complicated and there has been so much talk about it that I   think it might be as well if I wrote you an account of the dis   cussions leading up to the final decision by the Chiefs of Staff.   2  First fhase   This really covers the period from my arrival back in  London to the 24th March when the J.I.C./J.P S. Conference on  China began.    a  The idea of having such a Conference in London was  virtually implicit in S.A.C.'s decision at his meeting  in Kandy on the 50th January when he directed Carton  de Wiart to make recommendations to him regarding the  whole position in China with the idea that if he agreed  such recommendations he would put them up to the  relevant authorities in London.   As you know. Carton de Wiart's original recommendations  when a report of them leaked through to Kandy were  not much liked in S.A.C.S.E.A. and a rather acid  exchange of telegrams took place between Carton de Wiart  and General Browning. Carton de Wiart telegraphed  the text of these telegrams home to General Ismay  complaining about the position in which he had been  placed and asking General Ismay to do what he could  to help him straighten the matter out. C.D. and I  saw General lanay about this time were shown these  telegrams and asked for our views. We strongly  urged to General Ismay the view that the only possible  way to clear up the really appalling muddle into which  all British activities in China had got would be to  have a Conference in London of the British Chiefs of  Staff General Wedemeyer and representatives of S.A.C.  Carton de Wiart and C.-in-C. India. There would  then be some hope of getting a clear understanding  with General Wedemeyer as to what the role of the  British in China would be particularly as regards  para-military operations and following that a clear  decision as to the way in which British agencies   should be organized.   General lanay fully accepted this view and was able  to get the Chiefs of Staff to agree to the despatch  by him of a very pressing invitation to General  iedemeyer to visit London on his way back from  Washington to Chungking.

On this basis  invitations were issued to the other parties.    b  In the meantime S.A.C. had made his visit to  Chungking and from that visit emerged the proposals  for the organization of the British services In China  summarized In Gill Davies' telegram No. 5976 from  Chungking. We -and I think you also -thought  these proposals most unsatisfactory. They repre  sented the worst sort of compromise which would  ensure our getting the worst of both worlds. We  felt they would be particularly disastrous for  S.O.E. since if they were accepted before there  was any clear decision as to the role which was  going to be allocated to us by the China Command  our chances of getting any role would be gravely  if not fatally prejudiced.   c  The plans for the conference on the lines indicated  in a above became hopelessly confused as a result  of General Wedemeyer's reluctance to ccme to London.  Prom private reliable information which I have  received from Washington there seems no doubt that  he knew very well what he would be faced with in  London and was detenained to avoid a showdown if  possible. His let-out was to say that he could  not himself come owing to exigencies of time but  that General Hurley who was in any event visiting  London at the invitation of the Foreign Office could  perfectly well represent him at any meeting with the  British Chiefs of Staff.  This of course was not so and we recognized that  if Wedemeyer himself did not come there would be no  hope of getting the matter dealt with in the way we   wanted. The Chiefs of Staff however who had never   really given any serious thought to the subject and   were certainly quite unwilling to press the United   States Chiefs to insist on Wedemeyer's coming agreed  that the proposed meeting should go on and that the   representatives from S.E.A.C. and China should still  come.   Our next hope was to try and get ih e J.I.C. and J.P.S.  so briefed that they would understand that what should  now be done was to get a clear decision from the Chiefs  of Staff as to what they would like first as regards  policy ard. secondly as regards organization in China  with the idea that they would then try and get this  implemented by an approach to the United States Chiefs  through the J.S.M. an approach through Hurley being  clearly hopeless .   Unfortunately for reasons which are still not clear   to me but which are probably quite accidental the   J.I.C. and J.P.S. backed up by the Foreign Office  firmly refused to have any discussions on the subject  until the delegation from S.E.A.C. and China which  was then expected within a few days had arrived.  All we were able to do was to produce a paper on  the China position copy of which is attached at A  and try and get the facts and views set out therein  accepted by the two Service Ministries concerned.

In fact Hurley himself was  rather delayed and A.D.CX . i. A and Co. did arrive a  few days before Hurley was expected. It was clear  however that if the Chiefs were to be briefed at all  for what they still regarded though we did not as  their important meeting with Hurley the discussions  in the J.I .C ./J.P.S. Conference would have to be get  through very quickly so that an agreed recommendation  could be made. This atmosphere of urgency and haste  was an important factor militating against us  tnroughout the discussions.  As soon as we realized that the sort of Conference which  we hoped for from which it would have been possible to  get a clear decision on the role which it was desired  the British organizations should perform in China  was not going to take place we looked around for some  other method of getting this fundamental issue faced.  We finally decided that the best thing to do would be for   S.O. to raise the issue explicitly in a Minute to the  Prime Minister our idea being that the P.M. would  certainly pass this to General Ismay to obtain the views  of the Chiefs of Btaff who would then direct the  J.I.C. and J.P.S. to consider this Minute at the same  time as they were considering the question of organization  which would be raised by the proposals being broughthome by A.D.C .0 .S. A . This is in fact exactly what  did happen. Copy or S.O.'s Minute to tie P.M. is  attached as appendix to D.   -Meeting of Saturday 24th March.   Owing to the urgency of getting a brief prepared for the  Chiefs before Hurley's arrival the first meeting of the  J.I.C./J.P.S. was called as soon as A.D.C .O.S. A had  arrived with the result that his long paper which formed  the original basis of discussion was only circulated on  the morning of the meeting. Hot a single member of the  permanent staffs of the J.I.C. and J.P.S. except one of  the secretaries had read it when the meeting opened.   There had just been time for me to go through it with   C.D. We thought it quite appalling -a good deal  worse than the telegraphed summary of S.A.C.'s decisions  announced at Chungking -and it seemed to us essential  to oppose it since to let it go through would have  hopelessly prejudiced the whole issue of our future in  China which we were determined to have properly  decided.  The opening stages of the meeting were very awkward.   A.D.C.O.s7 A explained the substance of his paper    which nobody had read . His explanation was actually   most misleading but owing to the fact that apart   from ourselves nobody at the meeting knew or cared   anything at all about the situation and that the   permanent staff were primarily concerned to get a   quick agreed recommendation which they could put up   to the Chiefs nobody was likely to realize.it.

Aj s  proposals. It was obvious within half an hour that  apart from ourselves the proposals would go straight  through.    We were faced with a difficult decision. It was  obviously not going to be easy to oppose the proposals    alone. If on the other hand we let them go through    the result would certainly be that the main issue on which    we wanted a clear decision would never be taken by the    Chiefs at all. Moreover our position would have been  hopelessly prejudiced even if we were to carry on the  attempt to get a decision. Even if we had been able  to press for a ruling on policy on the basis of S.O.'s  Minute to the P.M. which had not yet reached the    J.I.C. and did not do so until the next day and had  as a result got a directive to go ahead our chance  of being able to implement such a directive effectively  would have been much reduced by the fact that we would  have had to work through a set-up on the lines of  A.D.C.O.S. A s proposals which would have already  been approved by the Chiefs of Staff.  I therefore decided that our only hope was to force  the issue forthwith at the meeting by     i attacking A.D.C .O.S. A 's proposals so  as to prevent their being immediately  accepted     ii  then trying to get the argument back on  to the main issue of what HJJ.Gr. wanted  the British organizations to do in  China.   c  Our case against ADCOS A s scheme v/as based on two main con  tentions.   i  This scheme was completely unrealistic in that it was  based upon a refusal to face up to the fact that  General Wedemeyer is in fact as far as we are concerned  the China Command and any activities to be carried out  by a British agency seeking an operational role in China  must be carried out for him. Furthermore all direction  and coordination of such activities in China was clearly  going to be carried out by General Wedemeyer directly  through his staff appointed for this purpose. It was  ridiculous to pretend that ADCOS A 's system by which  British activities would be coordinated by the British  G.O.C. and American activities by General Wedemeyer in  his capacity as U.S. theatre commander and then British  and American activities correlated by two staff officers  acting for these two commanders jointly could really  work. We made it perfectly clear that if there was any  question of the British Chiefs of Staff effectively  contesting General Wedemeyer1s position as virtual  Commander in China and insisting upon a really equal  status for a British Commander we would be only too  delighted to give such a move our fullest support.  In fact however everybody knew perfectly well that there  was not the slightest intention on the part of the  British Chiefs of Staff contesting General Wedemeyer s  claims. ADCOS Aj's scheme therefore amounted simply to  this -that we should go to great pains to avoid recog  nizing General Wedemeyer's position thereby refusing to",

This was simply to get the worst  of both worlds.     ii  The activities of the British agencies in China in fact depend  entirely upon General Wedemeyer's decisions. If there was to  be any chance of getting General Wedemeyer to allocate aiitable  roles to British services and accord them the necessary facilities  we must be able to present the strongest possible case for his  support. Nobody denied that General Wedemeyer would prefer not  to make use of the British services and would tend unless strongly  pressed to restrict their activities.  At the present time the case for pressing General Wedemeyer was  weakened by the fact that we could not pretend that the British  services in the way they are now organized represented a reason  ably efficient instrument for the China Command to use. It was  a first essential therefore for the survival let alone the  expansion of British activities in China that they should be  organized on a more effective basis. ADCOS A s proposals though  they might pretend to did not in fact make any serious attempt  to achieve this. On the contrary they tended to perpetuate and  increase existing difficulties and inefficiencies.     d Our case for trying to get the argument back onto the main issue of what  H.M.G. wanted the British organizations to do in China was simply that to  consider organisation before you had considered and settled policy was  putting the cart before the horse. In practice this really meant that  the first thing that the Chiefs of Staff should decide was whether they  merely wanted British agencies to continue their present activities  which were almost entirely activities for some outside authority and not  for the China Command and with the clear understanding that such  activities would tend more and more to amount to merely token representation  of the British effort in China or whether they wanted the British services  to secure a real operational role in the China Command and were prepared  to give the necessary backing for such a policy. Only when this fundamental  question had been settled would it be sensible to go on and discuss what  would be the best form of organization to implement the policy decided upon.   e  After we had made our case at considerable length on the above line there  was a good deal of desultory discussion mostly unsympathetic in its tone.  The two issues were not clearly distinguished and there was a tendency  towards concentrating on the pros and cons of ADCOS A 's organizational  proposals. Towards the lunch hour the War Office representative indicated  that he would like to see S.O.E s ideas on organization in black and white  so that he could form an opinion as to what exactly was implied in them.  Although this was really taking the issues in the wrong order we felt  that we ought not to refuse the opportunity offered for getting our views  fully before the Committee and therefore agreed to put up a paper as soon  as possible.   f We wrote our paper and submitted it the same night. Copy is  4. Third Phase -Monday. 26th.   a  Theoretically the discussion v/as supposed to be on the paper submitted by  us referred to immediately above in practice it wandered all over the  place and led nowhere. It began also to get decidedly acid in tone with  unpleasant insinuations being made as to our motives.   b  We kept on emphasizing that the real issue was one of policy and that no  discussion on anything else would get anywhere until this fundamental question  was settled.   c  This view was finally accepted by the Chairman. He pointed out however that  it was rather difficult for the Committee to discuss the question of policy",

Fourth Phase -28th March     a  Our paper referred to iroraediatdy above was submitted only on the morning  of the meeting an hour or so before it opened and most members of the  Committee only read it after they got to the meeting. The discussion on  it was as usual rather rambling but the general reaction was not too  unfavourable and for a moment it looked as if our proposals might get a  good deal of support.  The representatives of the J.P.S. howeve/who had hitherto been the most  sympathetic members of the Committee from our poin f view felt obliged  to point out that any policy which involved approaching General Wedemeyer  for air lift which would have to be from American resources in order to  implement operations by British agencies in China would weaken the hand  of the J.S.M. in Washington in their attempts to retain American aircraft  in S.E.A.C. as soon as possible.     b  On the question of the desirability and practicability of the operations  envisaged by our scheme it was decided that the views must be sought of  General Wedemeyer and the Ambassador in Chungking. Dening was instructed  to draft a telegram for submission to the meeting.   c  It happened that that day CD was entertaining ADCOS A at lunch and we  took the opportunity of explaining our position to him more fully emphasizing  that all we cared about was to get a definite decision on policy in China  out of the Chiefs of Staff. Under a good deal of pressure from our own  Air Vice Marshal ADCOS A finally agreed that this was reasonable and  undertood that on returning to the meetinghe would join us in proposing  a very simple telegram to General Carton de Wiart and the Ambassador on  the above lines leaving all questions of organization for later discussion  once the policy question had been settled. Needless to say however he  promptly went back on this undertaking as soon as the meeting re-convened  in the afternoon and did his best to get everything possible inserted into  the telegram which might raise contentious issues unfavourable to S.O.E.  As a result the telegram which eventually went was a pretty confusing  document. The meeting then adjourned until the 2nd of April to enable  General Wedemeyer and the Ambassador to reply.  6. Fifth Phase -28th March to 2nd April  During the interval I commenced private discussions with the J.P.S. on the  point they had raised regarding air lift which seemed to us the only  important factor which had been produced by all the discussions. As a  result of these private conversations I was satisfied that there was in  fact very little if any chance of the Chiefs of Staff approving any forward  move in China iontil there was nothing left to lose in the way of American  support in S.E.A.C.    7. Sixth Phase -2nd April  The meeting re-assembled to hear the reply from Chungking. I had not  anticipated a very helpful one but the message received from General Carton  de Wiart and the Ambassador turned out in fact to be even worse than I",

From that moment the decision of the Committee was beyond    doubt and it became merely a question of wording the paper and the    recommendations in such a way as to protect our position as much as    possible and enable us to Return to the charge if we wished at a more  suitable moment. How far we were able to achieve this you must judge  for yourself from the final text of the paper which you have no doubt    read.    8. Seventh Phase -4th April  The paper as finally worded by the last meeting of the J.I.C. and    J.P.S. referred to above was then submitted to the D.'s of P. who    made no substantial changes although they expressed grave doubts as to    whether the organization proposed by ADCOS A would work and feared  that the directive to the British G.O.C. might seriously annoy General    Wedemeyer if it were ever shown -to him. The paper then went forward to  the Chiefs of Staff.    Copy of relevant extracts attached at E.    An hour or two before they took it a second telegram came in from  General Wedemeyer and the Ambassador the contents of which are known  to you and which I assume to have been largely inspired by you. Copies  of this telegram were shown to the Chiefs in case they might wish in  the light of this further recommendation to return the paper to the    J.I.C. and J.P.S. After some discussion they decided that they would  not allow the telegram to interfere with their consideration of the  paper and their acceptance of the recommendations contained therein  but added a rider that if the F.O. wished the proposals contained in  the second Chungking telegram to be pursued they could be taken up  by the  Joint Staffs.    The net result therefore was that the paper submitted by the J.I.C.    and J.P.S. was approved by the Chiefs of Staff without amendment  and its recommendations became the decision of the Chiefs of Staff.  On the strong advice of the J.P.S. we decided not to press for any  review of the Chiefs' decision on the basis of the second Chungking  telegram.    The record of the discussion which took place when the second Chungking  telegram was read by the Chiefs indicated that there would not have  been much point in continuing the argument.    Copy of relevant extracts from this record is attached at F.    9.  In view of the attitude adoped by ADCOS A throughout the meeting and  his action in writing to S.A.C. I include hereunder some short notes  on his behaviour   a  His personal attitude throughout the discussions was most objectionable.  His two main offenses were  i  Persistat insinuations that S.O.E. was trying to get control  of all activities in China and absorb all other agencies. He  was aided and abetted in this by the S.I.S. representative  and to some extent by Cartwright and his insinuations -which  we have every reason to believe were sedulously propagated by  him outside the meeting -undoubtedly had some effect upon the  War Office representative. I am reasonably satisfied from  remarks which practically all of them made to me outside the  meeting and quite spontaneously that the permanent members of  the J.I.C. and J.P.S. did not accept and indeed rather  resented ADCQS A 's insinuations.",

In Southern Thailand we had set up an organisation to  operate in conjunction with military plans for the occupation  in certain circumstancesof the Southern tip of Thailand and  to undertake tin denial in that territory. At the outbreak  of war the organisation still needed improved ethods of  coammicatioa -but was nevertheless in a position to take  action. Owia to the fact however that the military plans  were never put Into operation as originally conceived an  that the instructions to take action were issued some nine  hours after Instead of as proposed in advance of the Japanese  landings in Southern Thailand it is feared that our personnel  were rounded up before they could take effective action.    Sven so some measure of partial denial of the tin mines on  the ast Coast might have been expected although the full  scale denial as planned could not have been carried out owing  to lack of time available. In general it my be said that  the whole scheme l.e. action In conjunction with the military  and Tin Denial failed primarily as Instructions were issued  to us too late and because the military situation was unsatis    factory.",

Unfortunatelyj the Director-General has gone away  on three weeks leave so I am returning the document to you as  I am sure you will not want to be without it for that length  of time.   On considering the point you raise I think it is  going to be very difficult to find a suitable B Division Officer  at the present moment as we are very hard-pressed having as  you know ' sent a great many officers to work in 21 Army Group.  However I know this problem is going to come very much to the  fore in the near future and when it does I will take an  opportunity of putting forward your claim in the strongest  possible terms.    own personal view is that if we were to send an  officer to India we should almost certainly send him to D.I.B.  to work with them and it might be possible for this officer to  unuertake the job which is suggested. I feel that it is very  important to have the services of an officer in D.I.B. as that  Organisation has considerable facilities throughout the country  for assisting Organisations such as the one wnich you have set  up there and in point of fact I see throughout the report  constant reference to assistance from the D.I.B. or from  ex-D.I.B. employees.

Undoubtedly from our point of view  this task will have to be undertaken in the  closest association with D.I.B. but I think  we shall have to do something about looking  for an officer now In case the situation  changes so far as you are concerned I shall  keep you in touch.    Thank you very much for mentioning Tim  Airy's organisation in Ceylon . I am sure he  will be of the greatest help to our people  there.    Yours ever    P.S.

Although General  Wedeaeyer has stated that he rates highly the S.O.H. type of  operation and that in hie view the bulk of the Chinese forces  are best used in irregular activities. It has nevertheless  become clear that h would prefer to use only American  Organisations for these purposes in China and unless an over  whelmingly strong case can bo made out he will not allot to  the British any role whatever.    S.O.K. are faced with precisely the seme issue in  General MacArthur s theatre.  1 am not desirous of intruding where we are not wanted  but it is germane to remember that we invited O.S.S. into the  Balkans when it was a purely British theatre and shared our  work there and in all other European operations with them in  close integration. We have now a number of officers who  have been trained in guerilla warfare for three years and  have distinguished themselves a guerilla leaders and I  believe that given certain limited airlift S.O.K. can make  a contribution in these theatres towards the defeat of Japan  in particular by the organisation training and employment  of guerilla forces in accordance with the technique which we  have learned by experience in the South East Asia Command and  elsewhere. if S.O.E. were able to conduct such guerilla  operations successfully British prestige amongst the Chinese  would be enhanced and our recovery of Hongking and British  Borneo might well be facilitated.    At present ay commitment in China is very small indeed  whilst in S.W.P.A. it is not much larger than the minimum  required to support from S. .P A. Admiral Kountbatten s  operations. X am in no way anxious to develop these commit  ments or to struggle to secure a role for S.O.E. in toe  American theatres with all the difficulties and complications  which that will entail unless His Majesty s Goverment desire  to maintain this British participation in the struggle against    Japan in these areas. If this Is indeed their wish I will  of course do everything possible but strong backing from  other departments will be required and some additional material    help will have to be given.    I shall be grateful for your guidance as to the line I  should follow    I am sanding copies of this Minute to the Foreign and  Colonial Secretaries.    SGD. SEDBQRNE.    15th March  1945",

It has been noted that this issue has in effect already   been raised by Lord Selborne s minute to the Prime Minister   copies to Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs awd the  Colonies of the ISth March of which a copy is attached at A   In order to brief the Chiefs of Staff on this issue which  it is assumed must eventually be referred to them we understand  that the J I C and J.P.S. wish to be able to set out the  position regarding the desirability and practicability of an   operational contribution being made by the British on the para  military and subversive plane to the war in China and to make  recommendations for or against the adoption of such a policy.   S.O.E. have accordingly been asked to put forward in as  concrete a fashion as possible their idea of what the adoption  of such a policy would involve how it could be Implemented  and what advantages might be expected from it.  In attempting to meet this requirement S.O.E. must point  out that it is impossible for them to put forward an altogether  concrete or hard and fast plan. Any scheme for a British  operational role in China must be acceptable to the China Command  and It is not likely to secure approval of this Command unless  it fits In with their general plan for the conduct of the war in  China. We are not yet aware of the nature of this general plan  and any ideas which we put forward must therefore be subject  to the qualification that they may require to be amended perhaps  radically in order to conform to the ideas of the China Command.  In this paper we can only put forward what seems to us the most   practical scheme taking into account everything that we know  of the situation in China and the intentions of the Generalissimo   and General Wedemeyer.   role  have  It seems to us that the main features of any operational  to be undertaken by a British organization in China would  to be as followsi- A.

In view of the known attitude of the Chinese authorities  and the views very clearly and firmly expressed by  General Wedemeyer at his meeting of the 24th January we  feel that the only para-military and subversive work  worth considering is that of support and direction by a  British organization of resistance elements behind the  Japanese line approved by the Central Government.  /  The proposed British organization refer JIC/584/45 would  endeavour to work with such Chinese resistance elements  for the purposes ofs  i Supporting encouraging and directing them in  guerrilla warfare in order to harry the Japanese  and interfere with their lines of communication",

Resources  From the point of view of the practicability of the programme  outlined above the following is the position as we see it  r arding resources available or likely to be available in the  foreseeable future to meet indicated requirements.    A.  Personnel  The following could be reckoned on for a unified  organization as proposed in JIC/384/45     1  The total personnel of the B.M.M. at present  consists of 52 at Headquarters at Chungking  made up of 17 officers and 35 other ranks  and a  Field Establishment consisting of    an advanced Headquarters 15 officers filled  a Demolitions Training . ing 11 officers filled  an Artillery and Weapon Training ling 28    officers and other ranks not filled a  Field Team of 14 officers largely but not  wholly filled a number of officers on  Is. of c. and demolition depot and some 6  officers still attached to General Li Mo An  in Kiangsi and Fukien. The whole Field  Establishment of the B.M.M. has been withdrawn  to India to re-fit. Neither It nor the  large Headquarters in Chungking have at  present any operational role nor can they  have one until it is allotted to them by    General ledemeyer. There is therefore  nothing unreasonable in the suggestion that  the whole of this personnel should be considered    as available for pooling in a unified British  operational organization if such a policy were  to be adopted.     j l  B.A.A.G. personnel consist of rear Headquarters  at Kunming B.A.A.G.

The experience of B.A.A.G. over the last 18  months has amply demonstrated that an organization  working behind the Japanese line in Southern  Kwan ung is quite capable of combining M.I.9 and   M.I.19 work with all other activities which can  b carried on behind the enemy's lines. What is  proposed therefore is that the present B.A.A.G.  personnel which incidentally includes 6 officers  seconded by S.G.E. to B.A.A.G. should be pooled  in the unified organization on the clear under  standing that the organization would make Itself  responsible for the execution to the fullest extent  of the M.I.9 and M.I.19 activities in the area  concerned at present being carried out as their  primary function by B.A.A.G.   ill  All S.0.E. personnel already in China who are  suitable for para-military and subversive work would  of course be available to the organisation. This  represents trie 14 British officers and 14 other  ranks now in Chungking and Kunming and includes  the Kunming W/T War Station which already carries  all signals for B.A.A.G.   Furthermore S.O .E .would automatically make available     the personnel both field parties and base  organization which is being released from Western  theatres as S.O.E.'s work in that area is coming   to an end. This personnel would of course be  highly trained and experienced in all the operational  and Headquarters work required in the activities  in question. No exact figure can be given for  the number in each category which would be available  at a given date but it can safely be assumed that  adequate personnel could be made available to start  operations on a small scale and develop them as  \\k  larger numbers were progressively released from  Eur ope.    iv  It has been suggested in JIC/384/45 that the  unified British organization if formed should  take over the personnel of E Group and G.B.T. at  present in China. As however this would only  be on the understanding that the organization  would make Itself responsible for the continuation  of this work and as for geographical reasons  the same personnel would nave to continue to do  it exactly as at present this would not .  represent any addition to the pool for the new  operational role envisaged above.   Arms and Equipment.   The provision of the necessary arms and equipment for the  maintenance of 30 000 guerrillas lias already been  tentatively discussed with the War Office. Estimates  which covered these requirements were submitted to the  War Office at the end of December and the latter have  indicated in the usual form that subject to the absence  of abnormal developments in the European theatres it   should  be possible to meet the demand by the dates indicated",

In the original plan whicn was worked  the Chinese authorities and based upon the maintenance  of 30 000 guerrillas the air lift involved in the  carrying out of the operations inside China amounted to  a total of 553 sorties over a period of nine months.  This  may be rising from 19 sorties using 7 aircraft in the first    optimistic  raonth to 91 sorties using 3l aircraft in the ninth month    reckoning    as the figures To enable the necessary stores to be assembled in China    still require  it will be necessary for General Wiedemeyer to allocate    detailed  a tonnage lift over the Hump of approximately 12u tom    calculation.  per month out of his present total lift of approximately  37 000 tons per month.    Even  these figures cannot be regarded as by any means    definitive as they represent an optimum figure based upon    what  we consider should be done If the necessary resources    were  available.    If General ' edemeyer as is only too likely were reluctant  to commit himself on the above basis it would still be  quite possible to commence operations on the modest basis  of the use of 7 planes i.e. half a squadron and build up  the work only as increased resources became available.    B.  It Is fully appreciated that at the present moment It is  inadvisable to raise the question of the possible use of  British aircraft for these operatiom in view of the  reaction which such a suggestion might have upon the  position as regards the American contribution towards  Admiral Mountbatten s Burma campaign. This situation  however will presumably alter at a relatively early date  as a result of the fact that with the fall of Kangoon  Admiral fcountbatten will cease to be dependent upon  American aircraft in S.E.A.C which will then in any  event be returned to the China Theatre whilst about the  same time the R.A.F. should as a result of the end of  the war in Europe be able greatly to reinforce British  aircraft resources in the Far East.    C.  In our view the case that can be made to General Wederaeyer  for the allocation of the necessary air lift is a strong  one.    He has already stated that based upon the total resources    available to the China Command he Is completing a plan  for the conduct of the war in China which will cover both  regular and Irregular operations. He has furtner  indicated both in Chungking and in Washington that lie    attaches a high importance to operations of an irregular  cnaracter In China holding the view that the Chinese  are more fit for this type of activity than for regular  military operations.    If he plans to have irregular operations carried out this  carries with it the Intention of making such air lift  available from the resources of the China Command as would",

All that Is left tuerefer is tbe question of to what  special organization these irregular operations should be  from time to time allocated. If there were in China a  British special operational organization which we could  reasonably claim was at least as efficient as the American  or Sino-Amerlean organization already existing it would  surely not be unreasonable for the appropriate British  authorities to press General ledemeyer fairly strongly  to allow a definite if limited portion of his irregular  programme to be carried out by the British organization.   China  is after all not an exclusively American theatre.   The legitimate interest of the British in China is great.  As long therefore as the British have a reasonablyefficient special organization in China such as that  s\\iggested in out JI 384/4S it seems to us that H.M.G.   could reasonably object to the allocation of the whole of  the irregular programme to O.S.3. and Commodore Miles s  Navy Group.   One factor which ought not to be overlooked is that if the  case is put to the China Command in this way there is a  good deal of reason to suppose that even if General  Wedemeyer wished to refuse any operational role to the  British he would have some difficulty in forcing this  recommendation upon the Generalissimo. There is little  doubt that entirely for their own reasons the Chungkirg  authorities are not anxious to see assistance to them in  the war against Japan exclusively concentrated in American  hands. Within the last two or three months senior  Chinese officials such as General Cheng Kal Min the D.M.I.  and General Pal Chung Hit the Deputy Chief of Btaff have  gone out of their way to urge upon British representativesthe desirability of British forces taking some part in tire  war against Japan. Although we know that General Wedemeyer  has recommended to the Generalissimo against the original   S.O.E. plan worked out with the Chinese D.Mil. we also  know that the Generalissimo has refrained from making any  decision and has not so far accepted the recommendation.  In conveying this infonnation to us within the last few  months General Cueng Kai Min stated most emphatically   tnat iie would like us to assure the British Chiefs of  Staff that the Chinese Government favoured British  participation in the war In China along such lines as  were envisaged by the original project of which he was   himself tiie principal sponsor.   6.  The advantages which might reasonably be expected from an  attempt to secure a role on the above l nes for a British  operational organization in China may be summarized as follows s- A. Given the extremely vulnerable character of the Japanese lines of communication in Southern China from Hengyang to  Nanning and from Hengyang to Canton it is not unreasonable  to suggest that some definite military value can be  attached to the encouragement of guerrilla activities which  would interfere with these lines of communication andfenerally hamper the Japanese even under present conditions.   n the event either of an Allied landing on the South  East China Coast whether in Ewar Jtung Province or in Fukien  or Chekiang which would involve substantial re-dispositionsand re-concentrations by the Japanese or in the event of  a Japanese withdrawal north from the provinces in question   such guerrilla activities would gain increased importance.  There is in fact no doubt at all that General edemeyer",

It    is merely a question of trying to get him to allocate    some  of this work to a British organization    B.  i he special reasons why it would be wortn while for H.M.G.  in its own interest to press for such an allocation are as  follows  i It is submitted that the attitude of H.M.G. In  this matter may have a very considerable influence  on Slno-Britiah relations. The Chungking Government  have made clear that they would welcome some    .  British contribution to the war in China and they  do not wish to be fbrced to put all their eggs into  the American basket. It must be appreciated that  what little is at present being done by British  services in China is being done not for the Chinese  or for China Command but for British authorities  outside that theatre. The Chinese know well  that the initial attempts of and S.O.E. to  obtain some role In China have been unsympathetically  received by General wedemeyer and his American  Headquarters If no further attempt is made by  the British to secure a role. If the initial rebuff  Is accepted and no steps taken to make a strong  case to General Wedemeyer then the Chinese are  bound to feel that we have washed our hands of  China and are content to see it become an  exclusively American sphere of Influence.     li H.M.G. are extremely interested in the recovery of  Hong Kong If Hong Kong is in fact liberated  entirely without the participation of British  forces the problem of its recovery for tie    Empire may be coH licated. If on the other hand  a British operational organization can take an  effective part on the lines sketched above In the  organization and direction of resistance in the  Kwangsi-Kwangtung Provinces there is a very fair  chance that British Officers may be in a position  to protect and support British interests in Hong  Kong. There are important elements in Free China  of whom General Pai Chung Hsi and Admiral Chan Chak  are by no means the least who whatever may be  their official utterances would in fact much    I prefer Hong Kong to remain In British hands.    If a British organization were working with these  leaders and their following In Kwangsi-Kwangtung  and British officers were on the spot and in  positions of confidence with leaders of Chinese  irregular forces from which they could influence    events on the basis of directives received from  the appropriate British authority very useful  \\work in the interests of H.M.G. might be done.    In setting out the above possible advantages S.O.E. wish  to make quite clear that they are not themselves presuming to  recommend any policy to H.M.G. and are concerned only to set down  what they consider would be the likely results of a given course  of action.    As Lord Selborne has made clear In his minute to the Prime  Minister S.O.E. is merely anxious to be informed of the policy  in accordance with which they should act.",

'    s/vc     From s LAMPIjOUGH fi or J.I.cl    Refaranee your 589S1 of 28 June and MACHItf TOPSEC 0937 of 23 June.    It is difficult to assess what lies behind the Chinese D.M.I's suggestion  w/iioh is quite revolutionary . I suspect one or more of the following reasons     a  desire to control British organisations in China   b  desire to operate Chinese agents in S.E.A.C.   o  desire to a trengthon Chungking s failing grip over Yunnan where  British organisations mostly operate   d  desire to create a counterbalance to the Americans   e  desire to sense our reaction to a unilateral approach j   f  desire to gain information which we possess and which the Chinese have  come to believe is more reliable than their own.  2. vie can however be sura that the Chinese feel they have more to gain  than lose by the arrangement and the timing of the approach after a visit by  tie Chinese D.M.I. to this H.Q. and G.H.Q. India had been agreed is particularly  significant.  3. In pite of this and the obvious difficulties involved it is clearly  desirable that we s ould not turn down Chinese approach out of hand . There  is & slight chance that co-operative reaction to present attitude of Chinese  may enable us to establish firmer footing in China that will allow our re  presentatives to operate more easily in future . Would suggest our reply  should be made soon and that it should welcome Chinese offer of oo-operation  whilst stressing inadvisability of definite commitments on either side before  proper investigation of the project by experts . M.A. Chungking might try and  draw the Chinese by asking them with whom it is proposed we should co-operate .  There appear to be five alternatives namely Chinese TAI LI SVANG PUNG-SON  the KUOMINTAWO Intelligence Service and the Overseas Ministry for some overseas  work . Re might ask if the Chinese contemplate any amalgamation of their  own organisations . How many British Officers would they require Who would  be the Chinese head of the proposed joint organisation What relationship  do the Chinese foresee a Sino-British organisation having with the American  Military and Naval Attache with Chennault s Air Attache with Commodore Miles  and with O.S.S. We could also draw attention to coming visit of Chinese  D.M.I. to G.H.Q. India and this Headquarters and point out inadvisability  of any concrete reply before then . A reply on these lines would show  we were willing to co-operate but were taking a practical attitude to  the problems involved . We should also be able to leave ourselves suffi'  margin later to evade the whole issue should the project prove impraotioab'  or undesirable . %further reactions to the implications of the Chins  offer are as follows  a  Suggestions in a A B and C go far beyond meaning of Minute  47 of Conference between CKS and SAC . These referred to pos'  of Garnons-Willlsuns end Wireless Sets .  /\\     b  There is a lack o f British Officers with knowledge of both Ja  language and Orde. -of Battle . Presumably Chinese speakers  also be required '.  TOP SECRET.",

                    "text": "TOP SECRET.    A joint Sino-British Intelligence Office would work in vacuo  uid with no real authority unless there were a comprehensive  amalgamation of various Chinese and British Intelligence organisations.    An Order of Battle Section to be of proper value must have access to    Signal Intelligence. This is obviously undesirable in present project    for security reasons . If Joint Order of Battle Section were    established which did not have access to Signal Intelligence    there would be discrepancies between findings of Joint Office and those  of London and iVaahington . Tills would lead to grave complications  in high level conferences.    There would be some value in establishing a joint intelligence  collection agency on lines of American JICA if only to keep us better  informed of activities in China and possibly to place our representa  tives in areas otherwise denied to us . This agency might be  divorced from evaluation of Order of Battle . It could also  include Americans .    O'  The employment of agents in occupied territores 1 raises difficulties .  The Chinese would presumably wish to put their agents into S.E.A.C.  or would expect us to withdraw from the China theatre . There  would also be grave complications in Trench. Indo-China with the  French and in the Philippines     g  There would be advantages in proper co-ordination of S.I.S. and S.O.E.  in China under a single individual on the spot and possibly of a closer  liaison between them and the TAILI and SANG t ONQ-SON organisations .   h  Co-operation on deception would raise security problems in  respect of future operations.   i  If suggestions of Chinese D.M.I. are adopted in whole or part the  crux of the problem will be selection of suitable personnel on both  sides .  4. I would therefore recommend a co-operative reply to China whilst  possibilities of e and g above are investigated . I would appreciate  guidance on line you wish me to adopt with Chinese D.M.I. when he visits this  Headquarters on about 23rd July .  5.

Ho discussions can take  place on any of these ureas without involving political considerations  of the highest importance. X have the following observations to  make on 083 activities in these areas.    BOHIA.   088 were already operating in Burma before SBAC was  feW-est tblishe i The desirability of their participating could there  fore hardly be oat led into question and the matter was therefore  one of oo-ordination. there are certain aspects of this co-ordination    which are not entirely satisfactory but I believe that It will not  be difficult to obtain General Donovan s consent to their being remedied  the political consequences of 038 participating in Surma will probably  not be discovered until after re-occupation.    cam.   X understand that it is the intention of Force 186 to  conduot activities in China on an extensive scale though China is  not in our theatre and is a separate theatre. X further understand  that Force 136 operations in China will be under the control of SACSEA.  X am not clear what the military purpose of these operations is in  relation to the operations of 3AC33A. Xt is clear that operations  of Force 136 in China will depend not only on the goodwill of the  Generalissimo but also on that of Generals Wedemsyer and Donovan  For this reason I understand that Fcree 136 are willing to make  concessions to General Donovan possibly in this theatre. Considerable  political complications may result from Force 136 activities in China  tout their extent oaimot yet be foreseen. I am averse from granting  concessions to OSS in this thoatre in order to secure facilities for  Force 136 in China which is not our concern. The political implications  in China are moreover the concern of H.H. Ambassador in Chungking.    SIAM.  Both 0 SS and Force 136 are operating in Siam. The  Siamese are in addition in coataot with the Chinese. Force 136    are suggesting that OSS have a political directive end they therefore  have a pull over Force 136 which has been ins ruoted by the cabinet '  HOT to become involved in political commitments I do not consider    that Force 138 should be encouraged to engage in politics in which  they are inexperienced and for which they have no charter. 1 think  we should say to General Donovan that Force 136 are warh under strict    instructions not to be come involved in politics in Siam and express  the hope that OSS is acting un er similar Instructions.",

These have been sought. If General Donovan brings  up this subject x think the parallel of the Philippines should  be quoted to hin. It should also be made clear that Force 136  left people behind in Malaya when the Japanese ovar-ran it and  they are best qualified to undertake the organisation of guerillas  resistance movements ato. if we cannot entirely obviate OSS  participation it should be oonfinad to coastal reconnaisanoe eta.  and deep penetration should not be permitted    SUMATRA.

X am not in favour of this procedure. if  the subject is raised you ha e always made your attitude perfectly  clear namely that you regard your verbal agreement with the General  iasimo as beinfe both binding and operative in the absence of any  decision by the CCS to the contrary. Unless General Donovan is  able to show that the U.S. Govt has come round to our point of view  there is obviously no basis of discussion. Force 13 with the full  knowledge of both your British and -American staffs are at present  engaged in implementing the first phase of their plan in Xndo-China  and the French are taking an active part. Unless OSS have the  authority of the U.S. Govt to do so it is not easy to see hew  they can play in with the French Mission which we on our part  regard as the sole French authority to the extent that Force 136 does.

Now that Force 136 is for the first time to  co-operate and be properly co-ordinated with military  operations it is essential that Army and other formation  commanders should   a  Dir  own front and on the enemy L of C e serving  that front.   b  Know  control can be exercised.  2. Both questions have been discussed with A.L.F.S.E.A.  14 Army and N.C.A.C. and complete agreement reached on the  question of direction on the following lines   a  Force 136 will have liaison H.Q . s or liaison officers  with 14 Army N.C.A.C. and 15 Corps while G-roup HA  Force 136 Calcutta will liaise direct with advanced  A.L.F.S.E.A. and E.A.C.   b  Formation Commanders and/or their staffs will  discuss and give their direction for S.O. action  to these Force 136 liaison H.Qs. and officers  through the special staff officers recently  provided by P Division for this purpose.  3. The question of the boundaries within which each  formation commander can exercise control has not been settled  and a decision on a high level is requested. The method  suggested which has been used with success in other theatres  is as follows   a  14 Army N.C.A.C. and 15 Corps would have their  lateral and forward boundaries laid down and within  these they would direct the activities of all  S.O. rartles.   b  A.L.F.S.E.A. forward and lateral boundaries would  also be laid down and they would then direct all  S.O. activities between the forward boundary of  lower formations and their own forward boundary.  For instance in this winter's campaign A.L.F.S.E.A.  boundaries might coincide with the frontiers of  BURMA. These boundaries as well as those of lower  formations would of course have to be extended as  operations develop in scone or in other areas.   c  All areas in S.E.A.C. outside A.L.F.S.E.A. boundaries  would be considered as a strategical area and remain  under the direction and control of H.Q.

The situation is not quite  as reported by Force 136. P Division received a letter from  Force 136 reference G.426/1250 dated 27th November on the  subject of control of Force 136 operations. The Head of P  Division did not like this letter as it stood. He communicated  his requirements to Headquarters Force 136 and has so far received  no reply. The letter now forwarded to you by Force 136 bearing  the same reference and date as the one originally sent to ' p  Division contains P Division's amendments. A copy of this  amended letter has not as yet been received by P Division  consequently they cannot very well take action.    2. I have asked P Division to take this matter up with  Force 136. In the meantime we shall r be in a position to  make decisions on the spot at Calcutta.  3. With regard to the proposal in the last sentence of  paragraph 3 of Mr. MacKenzie's minute. If you invite one interested  party to the Calcutta discussions I feel that you will have to  invite all. I saw D.of I. yesterday. He was toying with the  idea of joining the party.

But I am not sure what is the proper mode of  address from me to you to ensure that telegrams feo to the  right place and are suitably restricted in their distribution.  You appreciate that it can be a six-way traffic which -apart  from Kew Delhi and Kandy embraces the Foreign Office  Chungking Washington and Moscow. Would you enlighten me  3. Here the telegrams which will be docyphered by  British cypher staff come direct to me and I am responsible  for the distribution given if any. As an additional pre  caution telegrams which should not be seen by Americans should  have enciphered the prefix Guard. And all telegrams to me  should have the prefix Following for Dening.

The announcement of the establishment of S.E.A.C. led to  the widespread belief that major operations were pending in this  theatre. When subsequently the absence of resources and the with  drawal of resources already allotted made such operations impossible  there was considerable criticism chiefly in the American and Chinese  press.    Relations between China dnd S.E.A.C. were comylioated by  the failure to determine respective boundaries and by the presence  in S.E.A.C. of Chinese forces under American command. The boundaries  remain undefined but no major complication has arisen from the  employment of Chinese forces.    Anglo-American relations were affected by different concepts  ofstrategy inthatthemainAmericanaimwasto helpChinawhile the  main British aim was to destroy Japanese forces and to gain access  to the China Rea. There were further preconceived American ideas  about India and about British imperialism in general. Difficulties  arose over the acceptance of a French Mission in S.E.A.C. and the  situation as regards Indo-Chim was complicated not only by the  boundary question but by the absence of a clearly defined policy  towards that territory by the United States.    The Cairo Conference made an important pronouncement on  aetoiaaiatratitoiB. of territories occupied by the Japanese and to the  effect that neither Britain nor the U.S. nor China had ary territorial  ambitions in the war against Japan.

The following review covers the period from the setting up  of the Headquarters of the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia  in Hew Delhi in October 1S43 to the end of 1944.  A. Political factors affecting S.E.A.C.  2. The announcement by  of the establishment of the South East Asia Command under Admiral Lord  Louis Mcmntbatten appealed to the imagination and led to the widespread  belief that a major offensive against Japan from the west was imminent  and that this would take the form of large-scale amphibious operations.  3. The eap.er anticipation  not only an initial handicap to the South East Asia Command but the  nonfulfilment of its expectations through the absence of the necessary  resources lod to perpetual criticism principally in the ameriCan and  Chinese press. The situation was in part relieved by the statement to  the Press made by the Supreme Commander during his visit to London in  August 1944 but with the advent of the dry season of 1944-45 the Chinese  press-in particular continues to demand that S.E.A.C. should conduct major  operations and compares its activities unfavourably with other theatres.  4. The domestic difficulties involved in taking over from Gr.H.Q.  India its operational role are hardly within the scope of a report dealing  with international affairs but here again ill-disposed critics found  an opportunity to declare that Admiral Mountbatten was hampered by  lack of support from General Auchinleck. The patent untruth of this  accusation has eventually led to its being abandoned as a weapon of  criticism.  5. Another weapon which was particularly popular with American  critics was the alleged half-heartodness of the Indian war effort which  it urns easy to attribute to Britain's refusal to grant India complete  independence forthwith. This accusation was itself evideno of the  lack of any attempt on the part of Britain's critics to examine the  /Indian",

It wua in fact a critical and almost hostile audience  which faced the embryo Command when it opened its Headquarters in Hew  Delhi in the autumn of 1943. Militarily the situation was that after  I   a series of disasters in the far East in 194 -42 a campaign in Arakan  had failed in 1943 while the exploits of the late General Wingate's  forces though bringing a welcome ray of light into the unrelieved    gloom and demonstrating that the British soldier could be as tough in  the jungle as anyone else had achieved no measurable strategic result.    7.

The Generalissimo strongly  resented tho arbitrary transfer of cither Siam or Tndo-China from  his command and adduced various arguments-In thoevent Admiral  Mountbatten suggested that there should be no official pronouncement  on the subject but that both parties should be free to attack the  areas concerned the boundaries to be determined at the time in  accordance with the advance of the respective forces. The Generalissimo  was agreeable to this arrangement which was subsequently agreed   also orally to extend to prs-operational activities. Unfortunately  when the initial agreement was placed on paper there appeared a  second clause to the effect that apy political questions arising  out of the situation would be decided by an Anglo-Araerlcan-Chinese  Committee sitting under the Chairmanship of the Generalissimo in  Chungking. This latter clause was unacceptable to the Prime Minister  and the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Accordingly the  proposal with which the U.S. Chiefs of Staff and the President were  in the first instance disposed to agree has never been finally  ratified in any form by both President and Prime Minister and by  the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Admiral Mountbatten who had never  agreed to the second clause regards the remainder of his oral    agreement with tae Generalissimo as operative and binding in the  absence of instructions to the contrary.    10.

A number of Chinese    guerrillas had been committing depredations in the area and in clashes    with the Kachins a number of them had been killed. It is now proposed    to round up these guerrillas and to hand them over to the Chinese    authorities.    14. A further complication arose in Kokang which is undisputed  British territory by the high-handed action of the local Chinese forces  who amongst other things arrested and for a time detained the Myosa.  The latter was subsequently released and has taken up residence in India.  Brigdier 1/Silsen-Brand paid a visit of investigation to Kokang in  October 1944 and it is hoped that as & result of this visit conditions  may improve. But no effective re-assertion of British authority can  take place in Kokang until we are in a position to set up an administration  there. This will happen in due course and in the meantime as there  are no longer any British representatives there to molest it is hoped  that the situation may remain static.  15. In general it may be said that the potentially delicate  situation arising from the presence in Burma of Chinese forces under  American command has to the credit of all concerned given rise to no  major politic'.' differences during the period under review. The Chinese  Government on their part seem to have been genuinely desirous to avoid  trouble and apart from occasional local misunderstandings the  Americans appear bo have done their best in difficult circumstances.    It is early yet to prophesy that there will be no aftermath as a result    of Chinese occupation and it is perhaps too much to hope that Northern  Burma will be entirely free from the unweloom heritage of war. IShat  one can say of the years 1945-44 is that things might have been much    worse.    /16",

It is an irony of fate that  the comparative ineffectiveness of S.E.A.C. strategy up to  the end of 1944 was largely due to China. The most difficult instead  of the easiest way of recapturing Burma has been undertaken  because of the clamour to open some kind of a land route to China  and to secure that route and because of the need to expand and  protect air communications with China.    17. The lack of realisation in China of the part played by  S.E.A.C. has in the past been in some measure due to lack of  publicity. This has been remedied by the provision of better news  transmission from Headquarters S.A.C.S.fi.Ji. to the Press Attache  in Chungking and it is hoped that as a result of the consultations  which have taken place between His Majesty's Embassy and this Head  quarters there will be a further improvement.  18. The military crisis in China towards the end of the year  1944 led to the sudden removal of two Chinese Divisions from C.A.I.  Militarily the removal of Chinese divisions without regard to the  operational position in S.E.A.C. is unsound. Politically there  is no doubt that the removal of all the Chinese divisions in Burma  is to be welcomed for as long-fas they remain they are a potential  source of friction. They also tend to encourage the Chinese to believe  that they are playing a much larger part in the successful Burma  operations than is in fact the case.  19. A flhinese Mission to H.d .

Ho good American is  apparently happy about recovering territory to place it once more  under British rule and this factor tends to dominate his thinking  and even to make him forget that there is a requirement to destroy  the Japanese armed forces wherever they may be. With such a mental  background it is not difficult to nurse the suspicion that the sole  British aim in the war against Japan is to recover lost British  territory.  22. Secondly the basic American aim in South East Asia is to aid  China and not to destroy the Japanese in South East Asia. Partly  this is born of the somewhat ill-digested notion that it is possible  over fantastically long and slender lines of communication to  a major effort against Japan in and through China. Partly there is  the worthier idea of building up and enlarging the admirable air effort  sustained by General Chennault over several years in the face of  innumerable difficulties and haaards. And partly there is the less  worthy idea of obtaining a carameroial and economicfooting in China for  exploitation after the war.  23. Be that as it may. South East Asia Command is to some extent  divided against itself because the American conception is one of aid  to China while the British cojnsption has been to destroy the enemy  in South East Asia and to gain access to the China Sea in order to link  up with the Pacific forces and to take part in the final defeat of Japan.  So far the American concept has won the day and S.E.A.C. has devoted its  main and in the past somewhat unspectacular effort towards inoreasing  the air lift to China and to securing a road trace from uma to China.  The task has been more than a thankless one for as already described  the Command has been attacked for not doing more precisely by those",

The present air lift to China already  far exceeds what was carried over the Burma Road before Japan came  into the war. Rangoon will first and foremost be a base for further  operations against the Japanese. Secondly it will be the port of  entry for essential supplies to the civilian population of Burma  and only thirdly will it be the landing point for supplies to China.  It may be expected that there will always be a conflict of opinion  as to priorities between the British on the one hand fend the Americans  and the Chinese on the other. Great Britain s main land and air  effort against Japan is centred in South East Asia and there can be  no question in our minds that this should have first priority. Heither  the Americans nor the Chinese may fbr political reasons subscribe to  this view.   25. A third factor in Anglo-American relations in this theatre  has been that the Americans who are in a minority inherit a highly  critical outlook from those who were eyewitnesses of the disasters which  overtook us in 1942. Many Americans came to India feeling that we  had made a mess of things and their total ignorance of the Indian  political background made the situation as they found it appear even  more dangerous and sinister than it actually was in 1942. Coupled  with this was the feeling that the British were a drag on American  progressive methods and the suspicion that because the Americans were  in a minority the British were trying to dojthem down.  26.

In spite of aircraft and personnel shortages  it has been found necessary to increase the Air Forces  engaged in this role from two souadrons totalling 15 DE  aircraft in Tune 1944 to three squadrons and one flight  totalling 61 UE aircraft at the present time. Even this  large proportion of the total Air'Forces in this theatre  will be insufficient to fulfill the extensive requirements of  the Supreme Allied Commander.  2.  The S.D. operational year can be divided up into  three  distinct phases.     a  First Phase Tune -September 1944.  A period of preparation and build up of forces.   b  Second Phase October 1944 -Tanuary 1945.  Devoted to the infiltration of sxaall intelligence  parties and to put in the nucleus of the guerilla  raising liaison officers.   c  Third Phase February -May 1945.

Originally conceived by Force 136 the  operation now developed into a composite operation of 4 other  Clandestine Organisations In addition 4000/4500 levies were  raised to harass the enemy s lines of communication and retreat  in four rnain'areasj North along the Loikaw-Bawlake road Forth  Central in the Toungoo area South. Central in the Kyaukpyi area  and the escape roads to Siam' and Couth in the Papun area.

Coast Watchers and British    Ariay Aid Group parties in occupied China have been very great.  Aircraft had to stage fro Kunming and all petrol had to be  flown in by operational aircraft as U.S.A.A.F. stocks were  very short. A number of S.D. aircrews received special  training for the flight over the Hump but owing to the  sporadic nature of the tasks they were unable to keep in  practice. Flying conditions in China are often difficult  owing to unpredictable weather. R.A.F. pilots suffered froa  unfaailiarity with the complicated U.S.A.A.F. signals and  homing procedure. These reasons are assumed to have caused the  loss of two Dakotas one in March and the other in May. Both  these aircraft were engaged on carrying medical supplies to  the British Army Aid Group parties.  19. Siam. The Siamese Army and Air Force are ripe for revolt  against the Japanese and lack only the materials of war to be  an effective ally.

These officers lived up in the  mountains and the guerilla movement grew rapidly in strength  consisting mainly of Chinese. A Japanese massacre of many  thousands of young Chinese intended to exterminate potential  guerillas had the reverse effect and young Chinese flocked  to guerilla camps in the mountains fighting the Japanese   spasmodically from the fall of Singapore to the present date.

This was partly fiue to the difficulty  of working through the coastal belt from the few places  suitable for submarine operations.    At the end of 1944 determined effort was made to fly  Liberator S.D. operations to Malaya. This involved taking  off at the excessive All Up eight of 66 000 lbs with very .  small margins of safety in petrol. The first successful  operation was flown in December 1944 and was followed by many '  record breaking flights by Liberators of Nos. 357 and 358  Squadrons. On one such flight 3785 air miles were covered in a  non stop trip lasting 22 hours 55 minutes and another occasion  the aircraft was airborne for 23 hours 50 minutes. Both these  sorties were started from Jessore to D.Z s within 100 miles North  of Singapore. Monsoon weather from June 1945 now makes such  flights practically impossible from the North so that in  order to carry out a big Malaya programme No. 8 and No. 160  Sousirons together with the liberators of No. 357 Squadron are  based in Ceylon to continue the work throughout the nonsoon  until the end of September 1945 Even from Ceylon the tusk  of reinforcing and supplying parties in Malaya will reruire  long and difficult over sea flights but it is considered  that the expected dividends will justify the extra risks  to aircraft and crews involved.

After the withdrawal of our fighting forces from Burma early  in 1942 it became urgently necessary to obtain intelligence of the  enemy movements in preparation for their anticipated attack on India.  Infiltration by agents overland into Burma was a long and arduous  task calling for very highly trained jungle trekkers. Consequently  in May 1942 a proposition was put to the Air Staff at A..H.Q . India  by I.S.L.D. to drop agents by parachute.  3. The proposition was approved by the Air Staff and during the  following month a Hudson of the Air Landing School then at Delhi  proceeded to DINJAN Assam to carry out the first clandestine air  operation'from India. Two agents were dropped at night by moon  light and from the R.A.F. standpoint the operation was a complete  success.  4. Stringent security measures were requested by I.S.L.D. which  resulted in no official R.A.F. record of this operation being kept.  In fact throughout the twelve months that Air Landing School air  craft were used for this work no detailed information was kept  either at the School or at Air Headquarters.  5. This initial success caused/I.S L D. and G.S.I. k later to  become Force 136 to plan a series of operations of a similar nature  to be carried out during the moon periods of the ensuing months.  Unfortunately unsuitable weather conditions and the difficulties  of operating single aircraft from A.L.G s 1 300 miles from base  severely handicapped the R.A.F's co-operative intentions. Neverthe  less out of the ten sorties attempted between 1st June 1942 and  31st May 1943 six were entirely successful.  /Operations",

The successes obtained by the pilots of the A.L.S. encouraged  the Clandestine Services to plan air operations on an ever increasing  scale. It was obvious that small detachments of aircraft from the  A.L.S..would be quite inadequate for regular monthly operations.  Also the primary role of the School would be adversely affected by  the continual withdrawal of aircraft and crews.  7. Therefore on 1st June 1943 No. 1576 S.D. Flight consisting  of 6 Hudson Mark III aircraft was formed at Chaklala under the  command of Squadron Leader J.R. Moore who had been se rving as Chief  Flying Instructor at the Air Landing School.  8. The directive to No. 1576 Flight instructed all concerned  that the Unit had been established with the object of providing  resources for the operations required by I.S.L.D. and G.S.I.fk  without prejudice to the normal functions of the Air Landing  School All R.A.F. responsibilities for undertaking the training  and operations required by these organisations henceforward devolv  ed upon No. 1576 Flight. The normal forward bases used by aircraft  of the Flight was Dum Dum airfield at Calcutta. Once operations had  been approved the planning and execution of the air side-became the  responsibility of the Flight Commander.    9. The range of the Hudsons Mark III even when fitted with  overload bomb bay fuel tank restricted operations for all practicable  purposes to areas in Burma. Adverse weather conditions prevailing  over Burma during the S.W. Monsoon and the necessity for conducting  all operations by moonlight due to navigational difficulties placed  further restrictions upon the s'cale of operations.  10. During the first four months after the formation of No 1576  Flight weather conditions over Burma were particularly bad. Only  four operations were attempted during this period two in June and  two in August. In June one agent was successfully dropped and in  August a container was released. The two other sorties were abortive  11. In October 1943 three Hudsons attempted eight operations  involving nine sorties. All were completely successful from the  R.A.F. standpoint. \\  12. November 1943 proved a bad month from the weather point of  view. Only four operations were attempted of the twelve requested.  Two of these four sorties were successful.  13. The need for extension of operations to areas outside Burma  was fully appreciated and after long negotiation the addition of  three Liberator Mark III to the establishment of 1576 Flight was  agreed to by Air Ministry in November 1943. In addition it was  agreed that nine Catalina aircraft due to arrive from West Africa  should be earmarked for special operations.  14. The three Liberators arrived modified to M.E. S.D. require  ments which were considered unsuitable for the type of native agent  peculiar to this theatre. Lengthy experiments were put in hand to  modify the aircraft with a slide exit similar to that on the Hudsons.  15. Six operations by Hudsohs were attempted in the December  1943 moon period all of which were successful. January 1944  however proved a blank month as unfavourable weather prevented any  operations being attempted.  Operations of No. 357 S.D. Squadron. 1st February. 1944 -31st  August. 1944.

A Flight consisting of Liberators and Hudsons were to be  based at DIGRI and B Flight Catalinas at REDHILLS LAKE Madras.  The aircraft establishment was initially filled'with Liberators 3  Hudsons 7 and Catalinas 4  17. It was soon apparent that it would be impossible to operate  Flights consisting of fundamentally different aircraft and situated  900 miles apart under one Commander. Therefore Air Ministry  approval was obtained to throw off the Catalinas as a separate  Squadron to be known as No. 628 S.D. Squadron.  18. No 357 Squadron was not installed at Digri until 20th  February 1944 but the Hudson aircraft operated from Dum Dum during  the moon period from 5tb February to 17th February 1944-During  this time although only four nights were available they success  fully attempted eight sorties.  19. March 1944 was an epoch making month for S.D. Operations in  this theatre. Firstly six modified Liberators were delivered to  No. 357 Squadron and carried out the first two clandestine operations  to SIAM. Both were successful although two attempts were required  in one case. Secondly this month saw the largest air effort yet  put into clandestine operations in this theatre. Twentythree sort  ies were despatched of which twenty were successful from the air  standpoint. Lnfortunately this success was marred by the loss of  a Hudson which crashed in KLKANG on the Burma/China border killing  five'of the six crew. This was the first aircraft lost on B.D.  operations in this Command. Thirdly Flight Lieutenant Graham  357 Squadron s Medical Officer although he had not previously  dropped from an aircraft volunteered to be parachuted to the  rescue of the only surviving member of the Hudson crew who was  seriously injured. The rescue was successfully accomplished and  the doctor was awarded the D.S.O for his gallant action.  20. In April 1944 an attempt was made to stage a Liberator  operation to ' French Indo-Ghina using MCJNMING as an A.L.G.  The attempt met with disaster. One aircraft fully loaded made a  wonderful forced landing on the tiny fighter strip at Fort Hertz.  The second aircraft after being reported missing was eventually  found to have crashed in North China killing 13 R.A.F. personnel.  This was undoubtedly due to inexperienced crews attempting what  is accounted to be one of the most difficult flights in the world over   the Hump from India to China. On other operations Hudsons  claimed six successful sorties out of eight and Liberators five  successful out of six.  21. During the May 1944 moon period seven out of eleven Hudson  sorties were successful but only five out of twelve Liberator  sorties achieved success. One Liberator crashed on return twenty  minutes flying time from base due to lack of fuel. Bad weather  including electrical storms and 10/lOths cloud was experienced by  most crews during this month's operations.  22. Monsoon weather was at its worst during June 1944 result  ing in only six Hudson and one Liberator successful sorties out of  fifteen and nine attempts respectively. Thirteen of these sorties  were directed to one particular area but only one aircraft was able  to deliver its load due to 10/l0ths cloud over the D.Z. Similar  conditions were experienced in July 1944 resulting in three  successful out of nine attempted Hudson sorties. Liberators only  made two sorties both of which were successful.   23. Owing to monsoon conditions no operations could be carried  out from base during the August 1944 moon period but a number of  emergency sorties from A.L.G s were successfully carried out.

Hudsons made three sorties  from DINJAN Assam two of which were successful and Liberators  had two successful one from Sylhet and one from Kunming.    Operations by Catalina Plying Boats of Eos 240 & 628 Squadrons  from 22nd April 1943 to 31st August. 1944.    24. The first Catalina Plying boat S.D. operation in this  theatre was attempted by two boats of Ko. 240 G.R. Squadron on  22/23i'd April 1943. Both aircraft were stripped of special  equipment and one carried a small bombload to carry out a  diversionary raid. The landing attempt was unsuccessful owing  to a heavy swell in the selected alighting area. However a  second attempt on the night 25/26th April proved entirely succ  essful. The second aircraft circled overhead during the actual  landing thence proceeding to Tavoy to bomb the airfield as it had  done on the previous attempt.  25. Lack of submarine transport for agents coupled with the  obvious advantage in speed caused the clandestine organisations  particularly I.S.L.D. to plan a large number of'Catalina operations  following the initial success. However G.R Catalinas were  fully committed in their normal role and it was not until January  1944 that a second operation of this nature was attempted.  26. On the 15th January 1944 two Catalinas of Ko. 240 Squad  ron set out for Hit Island off the S Buri-m coast to carry  out I.S.L.D s operation BHZZARD. The operation was successfully  completed despite the fact that the starboard blister of the  landing aircraft was smashed and she had to take off with two  feet of waterflooding the blister compartment. The Catalina  was nearly three hours on the return journey before most of the  water had been baled out. The agents put ashore for this oper  ation were successfully picked up b3 Cetalinas of 240 Squadron  on the night of 14/l5th February 1944. Both operations were excellently  carried out.  27. Although formed on 1st February 1944 No 628 Squadron  did not attempt its first S.D. operation until Lay 1944 mainly  due to bad sea and weather conditions in the selected target areas.  On the night 2/3rd May a number of agents with kit were put  ashore in the Bangkok area. A reconnaissance on 10/llth May  failed to make signal contact with the party. During the same  month a S.O.S. was received from an I.S.L.D. party in the BASSEIN  area of Burma. A Catalina was sent to their rescue but was  unable to make contact although remaining waterborne for over two  hours whilst an I.S.L.D. Officer went ashore in an endeavour to  find tlie fugitives.  28. Monsoon conditions prevented further flying boat opera  tions until September 1944.  Conclusion.    2'9. The demands for air transport for the Clandestine Organ  isations for their operations has ever been in excess of the  amount which could be conveniently allocated. However future  plans of both the R.A.F. and the Organisations have now been  aligned and it is hoped that with the co-operation of all con  cerned clandestine air operations in this theatre will reach  proportions at least comparable to those in other theatres of war.    /30.",

In the absence of Colonel STEVENI on leave I am  replying to your DO/RCJ/INT dated 1st June.    2. Your para.l. I have received a copy of directive  headed Special Missions Unit signed by the S.A.S.O. file  reference 83/39/AIR dated 31st May and certainly as far as  we are concerned the formation of this unit of which you  gave us advance Information the other day will open a new  chapter In dealing with the question of our operations in  the future.  3. In this connection I would mention for your  information that we have during a recent trip to CALCUTTA  established a new drill within this Department as regards  all operations in which service transport will be required  and a Joint Planning Committee here in DELHI will be  established in this station to vet details of such operations  as are proposed following on directive received from M.I.  Directorate. As a result of this it is hoped in future that  subject to the feasibility of an operation being agreed by  the air officer concerned and the necessary priority and  authority having been obtained from the Chiefs of Staff  Committee it will be possible to put final requests before  you in a more concrete and clear cut manner than has been  possible in the past.  4. Now with the formation of this Special Missions  Unit and following the clear drill in the S.A.S.O s  Directive referred to there should be I am sure a very  good chance of achieving a greater measure of success  than has been possible before.

Operatlons/1576 Flight    During my recent absence In CHINA S/Ldr. MOORE    O.C. 1576 Flight has had an unofficial talk with our  CALCUTTA representative and also our newly appointed  Operations Officer Lieut. Colonel A.N.T. RANKIN. As a  result of this talk it would now appear that the various  difficulties which formerly confronted us in staging  parachuting operations in BURMA with the assistance of  the R.A.F. can now be largely overcome following the  introduction of 1576 Flight to assist us and S.O.E  2. One of the points raised at this meeting and  which I should be grateful if it could be finally  settled concerns the flying from DUM DUM to CHAKLALA  and back to DUM DUM of parties for parachute training  prior to their ultimate despatch on their missions. We  understand that 1576 Flight is equipped with six operation  al Hudsons with an additional six craft available on  demand for replacements. As the R.A.F. would naturally  not want to use up flying time on non-operational flights  may 1 suggest that consideration be given by Air Head  quarters to locate two of these reserve machines forth  with to carry out the necessary ferry service between  DUM DUM and CHAKLALA. In making this suggestion I under  stand that Air Headquarters have already agreed in  principle to a request made by me that our agents sent  to CHAKLALA to carry out parachute training would be  lifted from DUM DUM to CHAKLALA and back to DUM DUM by  aircraft of 1576 Flight.  3. I should be grateful to receive a reply to the  above suggestion at your earliest convenience.  Yours sincerely.",
