Synopsis
This research investigates intuitive experiences that bring a sense of connection.  It aims to show that moments of connection, often without words, hold significant therapeutic value for children in Art Therapy.  The exploration takes shape within three sections.  Within the first section a sense of feeling connected is considered in relation to an infant�s early development.  The second section focuses on aesthetic connection and the third section considers where such meetings take place.  The research has set out to consider the interaction of all three areas of investigation.

Three excerpts from clinical practice have been placed alongside descriptions of the experience of viewing three pieces of art.  This has involved thinking about how it feels to look at works of art and how it feels to be with a client in therapy.  These two elements have been juxtaposed to allow an exploration of the interplay of experiences.

The passion of Flamenco illustrates the potential spirit and vitality of these moments, while the seclusion and tranquillity of the Zen Tea Ceremony resonate with a calmer internal process of connectedness.  This research reaffirms qualities of openness and acceptance as essential to the therapeutic relationship and considers ways for the therapist to sustain a genuine and authentic approach through links to Buddhism and meditation.



Moments of Connection

1. Introduction
This research aims to enquire into moments of connection, which can be experienced in Art Therapy.  In seeking the essence of these shared experiences, it considers what happens when the child and therapist are moved by an image or by each other and how the emotional tone of this experience is transmitted and received.  The emphasis is on nonverbal interactions that bring the feeling of something authentic and vital.

Zen philosophy reminds us that we need not seek to learn something new, just realise what is already present.  With this in mind this dissertation will suggest ways of understanding something fundamental to Art Therapy, which through its nature cannot be grasped or manufactured.  Art Therapy provides an environment where it is possible for authentic connections to be made.  Pressures arising within teams and organisations can at times threaten to impact upon this potential.  Under such demands, Art Therapists need to find ways to sustain their sensibility to receive these fleeting communications. 
 
Duende is a lived experience that has the potential to connect people to each other and to art.  Federico Garcia Lorca (1934) talked passionately of the Duende as the essence of what is truthful and genuine artistic expression.  It is a reminder of the edges, the depth, the passion, the danger of creative life.  Lorca celebrates the fever and vitality within the Andalucian�s relationship to the art of Flamenco.  Singer, dancer and musician know that no emotion is possible without the mediation of the Duende.  If the dancer can find a truthful expression that transcends discipline and technique and allows in the untamed forces from the earth and the ancestors they will encounter the Duende (Webster, 2003).  Whilst possessed in this way, the dancer acts as a mediator of emotional connection.  The audience may experience a feeling of being held by the music.  Separation between self and rhythm disappears as dancer and musician collaborate to draw emotion out of the audience.  Captivated, as through entranced by this mysterious power the audience are drawn into the collective experience.  Duende harbours energy; struggle, vitality and excitement that can disarm and transport an audience.  It calls upon openness to an indefinable force that alters our way of being.  �The woman fills us and the evening around us, with a sense of another space� (Webster, 2003, p.22).  This other space will be explored further in relation to art and therapy as a potential meeting place for authentically felt moments of connection in Art Therapy. 



2. Method
The dissertation includes three descriptions of the experience of viewing pieces of art.  An excerpt from clinical practice follows each description.  This has involved thinking about how it feels to look at works of art and how it feels to be with a client in therapy.  These two elements have been juxtaposed to allow an exploration of the interplay of experiences.  A discussion follows, which aims to develop understanding of moments of connection within the therapeutic relationship.  Each discussion considers threads of enquiry that resonate between clinical material and the aesthetic experience of being with three pieces of art.  Aspects of theoretical and philosophical understanding contribute to each discussion.  In this way theory and philosophy have filtered and shaped the investigation of both clinical material and the experience of viewing art.

Including the experiences of looking at artwork in galleries and art spaces recognises the roots from which Art Therapy has grown and acknowledges art as intrinsic to human experience.  The placing of art before each clinical example leads the reader into the area of enquiry and assists the interplay of the aesthetic and the psychological throughout the investigation (Maclagan, 2001).

This investigation sets out to track a sense of connection within felt experience, intuitive understanding and imagination, which lie �at the edge of what can actually be put into words� (Maclagan, 2001, p.304).  Maclagan draws upon the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty to consider �� complex transactions that cut across conventional divisions between the subjective and objective facets of lived experience� (Maclagan, 1999, p.34).  A phenomenological approach seems relevant to this dissertation as a method of looking at things, absorbing them and seeking the essence of that experience.  A phenomenological approach accepts our experience of the visual world as ��not just a matter of registering impressions or responding to external stimuli; it also involves the mobilisation of a whole range of psychological effects- feelings, memories, imaginative constructions of one kind or another � many of which may not enter into our conscious awareness or perception� (Maclagan, 1999, p. 35).  Merleau-Ponty states ��to look at an object is to inhabit it and from this inhabitation to grasp all things� (Merleau-Ponty, 1962, p.68). 

The process of juxtaposing experiences provides a method for rigorously looking and coming to know the essence of these experiences.  The dissertation uses a phenomenological approach as a way of researching important elements of my own clinical practice before the possibility of further enquiry.  Developing a greater understanding of the philosophical background of phenomenology would be of benefit to a continuation of this area of research.  


2.1 Structure
The juxtapositions are divided into three sections.  The first juxtaposition looks to the infant�s early experiences of emotional connection within the frame of Attachment Theory.  The second juxtaposition explores moments of feeling connected in relation to an aesthetic response.  The third juxtaposition follows some aspects of spiritual philosophy to consider the role of the therapeutic environment in facilitating moments of connection.  Aspects of theory and philosophy to be drawn upon in discussion precede each juxtaposition. 

In structuring this dissertation throughout in such a way that enables the juxtaposition of descriptions of the experience of viewing art and the experience of being a therapist with a client, I have been able to consider the links between aspects of attunement, aesthetic connections and facilitating environment.   

The case material used in this research has taken place within a Community Child and Family Therapy Team.  Case examples used are considered in relation to furthering an understanding of area of research and consequently much is not followed up and explored within this writing.  All identifying names and features have been changed to protect client confidentiality.



3. Juxtaposition 1: Attunement 

3.1 Attachment Theory 
John Bowlby (1969; 1988) describes a universal human need to form close affectionate bonds with others.  His use of Attachment refers to the unique relationship, which is formed between an infant and their primary care givers.  The development of Attachment Theory placed the quality of these relationships as pivotal to all aspects of the child�s development.  Strong and secure attachment relationships are crucial to the well being of the child.

The developing child builds up a set of models of the self and others based on repeated patterns of interactive experience.  Within their early attachment relationships, infants must form a sense of themselves in relation to others.  A securely attached child will store an internal model of a responsive, validating and reliable caregiver and will feel them self to be valuable and lovable.  This child will have the potential to bring constructive and optimistic expectations to all future relationships.  A child that has experienced disruption, inconsistency, trauma or loss in early, attachment relationships will often be wary and anxious in relationships.  This child will have limited skills in engaging others in mutually enjoyable, reciprocal interactions.


3.2 Attunement
In his work to depict the development of attachment relationships Daniel Stern (1977; 1985) observed in detail the lyrical cadence of moment-to-moment interactions between mothers and infants.  Such moments occur numerously in the day-to-day life of the family.  He states: �The mother infant interaction I was watching seemed to be an elaborate dance choreographed by nature� (Stern, 1977, p. 3).  Stern showed these moments held shared experience of emotional connection and that they acted as building blocks to the strength of the relationship.  
Attunement begins when the infant is around the age of nine months; when the interactions between the infant and caregiver develop into an intersubjective relationship, that is to say an area of interplay builds up between their two different subjective worlds.  Stern explains the process of attunement in three steps.

1. The carer must be able to read how the infant is feeling from the infant�s behaviour.
2. From that reading the carer must perform some actions that does not simply imitate the child�s behaviour but does correspond in some way with the infant�s behaviour.  
3. The infant must be able to read this corresponding parental response as having to do with the infant�s original feeling experience and not just imitating the infant�s behaviour.

With all three of these conditions in place feeling states within one person can be knowledgeable to another and both can sense, without using words that the transaction has taken place.  Each specific parent and child pair is unique and the range of interactions may contain eye contact, physical contact, movement, and rhythm.  By translating the same emotional state into another modality the adult conveys the essential fact that it is the inner state that is matching.  In this way the carer is leading the baby into more complex experiences of interpersonal encounters and union.  


3.3 Clinical Application
Daniel Hughes (1997) tells us that children who fail to form an intense attachment to a parent may not easily master Stern�s three steps of attunement.  �They do not �dance� well and are reluctant to learn how.  Even if they have motivation to learn they often cannot hear or understand the music� (Hughes, 1997, p.21). 

In his work with fostered and adopted children therapy takes place between the therapist, the child and the parent.  Hughes creates a therapeutic atmosphere based on attunement.  Within his therapeutic model, encouraging attunement experiences are seen as crucial in helping the poorly attached child to feel connected to their parent and therapist at a preverbal level.  Through the process of attunement, the child can regulate emotions and behaviour and begin to integrate divided and rejected aspects of the self.  


3.4 Nicola Hicks �Game� 

    
Figure 1 Nicola Hicks �Game�


When I first walked in to the gallery at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park and saw Nicola Hicks� sculptures and large vivid un-mounted drawings on brown paper I felt excitement and elation and an engulfing feeling of having found something of myself that made me almost need to turn away.  The sense of drama captured within interrelating characters resounded through the earth like materials of straw and plaster, looking like mud and clay.  

Hick�s sculpture, �Game� (figure1) has captured a moment of matched gesture.  The figures seem in tune with each other and immersed in a game.  Poised, perhaps about to start a formal dance, there is a sense of each claiming their own space; right foot forward whilst also joined co-conspirators in the connection to animal nature and imaginary play.  Being with the sculpture the connection seems deeper but unfathomable.  Sensitivity and knowledge are set into the rugged and energetic materials, which seem to capture a living truth.  These figures hold a theatrical moment creating an aura of intense force and anticipation.

The catalogue describes observations of the reactions of gallery visitors as shifting from admiration through inquiry and even to concern.  We are brought close up to the potential for a misuse of influence and strength in what may be a disturbing one-sided relationship.  What is missed here perhaps is the deepening sense of pleasure that matured with my interest.  To be surrounded by her work was as if to be given temporarily the gift of entering the world of a child�s imagination where we might find ourselves effortlessly in the company of fox people. 

The sculptures themselves, energetically constructed are fabulous to look at.  But it struck me that the tension and arresting quality of this sculpture lies in the relationship; vitality is held in the space between the figures.


3.5 Case Example 1
I began working with Sarah when she was ten.  We have worked together for a little over two years and this session took place at twenty-one months.  Sarah�s parents were unable to provide consistent care and she experienced physical and emotional neglect in her early years.  At the age of four she began living with her grandparents.

In her sessions, Sarah placed a great deal of her energy into controlling the room, the materials and me.  She seemed not to need anything that she could not find herself and seldom asked for help.  She would play in the sessions but she struggled when I said or did something playful.  Avoiding reciprocal fun seemed essential to maintaining control and feeling safe in therapy.  When she did not feel safe she showed heightened anxiety through very loud primitive sounds and giddy exuberance.  At these times of high anxiety she also used different materials to avoid my gaze.  The materials varied in density and translucency and became part of a tense and forceful game of peep.  Sarah would often smell materials.  Her exaggerated sniffs and startled gestures in response to a smell reminded me of a small animal, a rabbit or gerbil but made bigger.

Despite Sarah�s competence and skill the art materials quite often appeared to provoke a sense of battling and a need to conquer.  During these clashes I have struggled to think about offering technical help.  Much of what I have tried to offer in her therapy seems to have rebounded untouched.  On this day Sarah brought the tub of air hardening clay out from under the sink.  I felt a little apprehension.  Usually Sarah would find some satisfaction with her work, but clay had not yet yielded to her intensions, so on this day, when she chose clay, I wondered how it would go.  

Sarah found a rolling pin and began rolling out the clay.  It stuck to the table.  She did it again and once more and I could feel another battle ensuing.  I let her know that rolling out on a cloth would prevent it sticking.  Sarah seemed not to hear, or rather was not able to act on hearing.  I wondered about getting up and demonstrating but this seemed tremendously difficult and I stayed in my chair.  After a short time of further faltering I got up, took some paper towels from the dispenser and demonstrated rolling out clay successfully.  Sarah looked at me briefly.  I experienced a warmth, softness and openness in her look, as if she had momentarily accepted my care.  She brought us back to a practical state by reservedly showing approval of my method and getting on with shaping the clay but the feeling remained.  It felt as though our brief exchange had brought forth a mood of tenderness and calm.  I began to work with her to make a slab pot, wondering if we might extend these moments.  


3.6 Discussion
This research seeks to determine that moments of connection are a significant experience for children in art therapy.  Material from Nicola Hicks� sculpture and the excerpt from art therapy practice have been juxtaposed and will now be discussed with reference to insights from attachment theory.  

Art viewed in a social and cultural environment may ignite a personal experience.  Being with Nicola Hicks sculpture made a powerful aesthetic impact richly embedded in psychological resonance that Maclagan (2001) refers to as �Psychological Lining�.  Alongside the raptness of her handling of materials and the sensual qualities of her work, Hicks has captured a potent moment of interaction.  The figures stand silent, placed apart creating physical space between them that feels to be charged with emotional content.  Had the figures been placed further apart the tension would have been broken.  Closer together there would be no space to explore.  It is the skill of the artist that has found this optimum space.  The sculpture reflects something of the vitality and anticipation within the therapeutic relationship.  It shows us a visual representation of the intersubjective area of interplay between therapist and child, which echoes early relationships (Winnicott, 1974).

Sarah had experienced inconsistency of care as a young child.  She was distrusting of emotional exchanges and resistant to letting go of her desire to control her environment.  Trusting that her inner state could be felt and known through the process of attunement was not easy.  She maintained a position of separateness as reflected in her difficulty with engaging in mutually enjoyable experiences; we struggled to get in step (Hughes, 1997).

I had hesitated before acting upon my wish to offer further help in managing the sticking clay and felt for a short time frozen in uncertainty and fear.  Held in that moment I was attuned to Sarah�s fear of intimacy and all of its potential failures, losses and abuses. 

As Stern (1985) describes, to be able to attune to an infant the carer must be able to read how the infant is feeling from their behaviour and from that reading perform some actions that do not simply imitate the child�s behaviour but correspond in some way with the infant�s behaviour.  The infant must then be able to read this corresponding parental response as having to do with their original feeling experience.  Our brief exchange of eye contact communicated a moment of attunement allowing feelings to pass unspoken between us.  In reading and feeling Sarah�s fears I was able to let her know that she had been understood and she was able to read and accept my response so that it became a shared understanding, 

The mood from that moment was calm, which is an experience described in Attachment Theory as a relaxed state in which it is possible to get on with things (Bolby, 1969).  Reaching this calm state through the process of attunement, the child in therapy may begin to reintegrate divided and rejected aspects of the self (Hughes1997).  

I wondered whether my hesitance before offering help reflected Sarah�s painful tension and struggle to avoid needing anyone alongside a growing sense of the potential for greater connectedness.  I understand my own feelings of warmth as a response to Sarah�s ability to allow closer intimacy.  I was touched by her openness.  Those few moments of genuine reciprocity brought something new to Sarah�s therapy.  With the help of a lump of air hardening clay, we had together briefly held a sensitive and delicate thread of connection. 

Art Therapist can refine their skills to remain sensitised to the child�s tentative gestures towards making a connection in therapy.  Relating in this genuine and meaningful way carries emotional vitality.  These kinds of moments are sustaining and joyful.



4. Juxtaposition 2: Aesthetic 
Connections 

4.1 Aesthetic
The use of the term aesthetic in this dissertation refers to those qualities of any experience that are inherent within the experience itself and to which we respond through our senses.  Aesthetic responses are often subliminal in that they have taken place before we are fully conscious of them (Maclagan, 1994).  Exploration of aesthetic connections will investigate the nature of an experience that can take us by surprise in its intensity and capacity to remodel our thinking and being, for as Maclagan states:  �Aesthetic qualities not only express or suggest feeling states; they shape them and constitute them� (1994, p. 50).


Psychological Aesthetics
David Maclagan�s use of the term �psychological aesthetics� refers to the relationship between the actual material properties of art and the inner effects that they have on the observer (2001).  Maclagan informs us that seeing has a psychological lining.  He states:

Our experience of the visible world is therefore not just a matter of registering impressions or responding to external stimuli; it also involves the mobilisation of a whole range of psychological effects-feelings, memories, imaginative constructions of one kind or another-many of which may not enter into our conscious awareness of perception (Maclagan, 2001, p.35).

The aesthetic response relies upon an imaginative inhabitation of a painting, which involves participation in seeing.  Engaging with the experience of seeing will gain depth and resonance of meaning.  Extending the ideas of philosopher Merleau Ponty, Maclagan describes this way of seeing as �wandering about� a piece of art.  


4.3 The Aesthetic Moment
Christopher Bollas (1987) describes the aesthetic moment as an experience of being and not in mind.  It is then something that we feel our way into perhaps unknowingly that cannot be grasped by our intellect.  These moments, Bollas says are fundamentally wordless occasions; a total involvement of the self, an experience of immersion where time seems suspended.  This kind of enchantment provides a sense of deep rapport and emanates the sense of an illusion of things fitting together. 

Bollas directly relates the mystical and luxurious pleasure of being held by something; an object such as a pebble picked from a beach, a painting, a poem, or a place, to a reconnection with the moments of infancy when our internal world was partly given form by a containing parental figure.  Bollas tells us the shift of consciousness that enfolds an aesthetic experience encapsulates in some respects a memory of this early containing relationship.  


4.4 Pipilotti Rist  �Sip My Ocean�

Figure 2 Pipilotti Rist 'Sip my Ocean'

Figure 3 Pipilotti Rist 'Sip my Ocean'


The video installation �Sip My Ocean� by Pipilotti Rist (figure 2. and figure 3) created an alluring space.  I caught a glimpse of the lulling sound and mesmerizing imagery and made my way to it.  The video plays on two intersecting large screens set at a right angle, forming a junction where images converge and meld.  It is a video of a churning ocean of changing visual forms.  The camera takes you on a voyage focussing on the movement of the artist underwater as everyday things sink slowly to the depths of the ocean floor.  The artist�s whispery and scratchy version of Chris Isaak�s pop song, "Wicked Game", soothes and intrigues with its haunting melody.

Pictures and sound are almost hypnotic.  They seemed to speak of sensual happiness and after a little time I caught a feeling of falling into lightness and openness unlike an everyday kind of experience.  Pipilotti Rist radiates blissful easiness.  She appears at ease with her body, and the world.  She seems both vulnerable and carefree in the sincerity of her performance.  There is a whimsical youthfulness; you sense that she is enjoying moving in the water and it is as if the boundaries between self and environment have dissolved. The feeling transcends the screen and is infectious.  I was already planning to return.

The lingering messages of the domestic objects falling through the water, perhaps signifying the inevitable deterioration of an elated state into domesticity and ordinariness are intriguing but this exploration intends to stay with the aesthetic experience, which brought a blissful sense of dissolving.
  

4.5 Case example 2
Aaron is a fifteen-year-old boy.  He has been attending Art Therapy for about a year.  He has brought feelings of isolation and loss following the sudden death of his father in a road traffic accident.  Aaron has a number of younger siblings who have a different father.  Early in our work together I became aware of Aaron�s complex feelings of love and loss towards his father that existed before his father�s death.  Conflicting relationships within their wider family have continued to cause distress to Aaron and his immediate family.  His grief engulfed the therapeutic space seeming to forge a chasm of nothingness between us that felt desperate at times.  We did not talk very much except in relation to the life of his artwork, when he was able to enter a flow of imaginative invention.  Making artwork seemed to bring a sense of relief and connection.  

Aaron had been working on a collection of animal characters, all with unique characteristics that sparked specific and complex relationships when brought together.  Some characters did not meet, but were aware of each other�s presence within a protected and hidden world (figure 4).  I found his work visually exciting.  Vibrant colours painted onto clay and bright feathers and cellophane came together to form a carnival of bustle and commotion. 


Figure 4

Having stated his intension to create a new character, Aaron was distracted by earlier work that he now saw as unfinished and in need of reworking.  One piece was a snake decorated with small coloured bits, which he recovered in a different combination of colours.  The effect was lighter and changed the camouflage of the snake from that of a multicoloured earth to a sandy, pale environment.  He also worked on a bird, adding the outline of wings and some colour (figure 5).  When he sat back he looked at the animals for some time.  I was struck by their position, both facing him as if awaiting his next move.  I asked what he knew about the animals.  This had become a familiar way that I would invite him to share his story.  He would tell me in a matter of fact way about their strange and magical features and we would temporarily take off together into their world.  �The snake has shed its skin,� he stated.  This seemed important and I immediately felt an activation of my own anticipation.  I tried to reply calmly, �oh, I think that a snake sheds its skin when it grows�.  I was curious about the relationship between the creatures.  Aaron told me that the bird catches food for the snake.  He went on to explain that the snake finds precious jewels and takes them to market where he sells them and uses the money to buy bird food.

4.6 Discussion 
A discussion follows which will extract insights from theoretical investigations into the aesthetic experience through the work of David Maclagan and Christopher Bollas.  It will use these insights to explore the interplay of experiences belonging to viewing �Sip My Ocean� and to being with Aaron in Art Therapy. 

Maclagan (2001) views the aesthetic response to be reliant upon an imaginative inhabitation of the artwork.  Often subliminal, an aesthetic response can take us by surprise in its intensity and capacity to remodel our thinking and being.  Imaginatively entering into the domain of Aaron�s images and momentarily taking off together felt like a relief from emptiness.  Inhabiting this imaginary place acted as a temporary retreat from the almost unbearable truth of the real world.  �Wandering about� (Maclagan, 2001, p.36) the imaginative flow of Aaron�s images as he told his stories felt to be a significant element in my attempts to make contact with him.  This involved a kind of space walking that maintained a lifeline to the space station, which was itself in contact with a team on earth.  Holding on to this anchoring, became the primary challenge for an extended period in my work with Aaron whose absence whilst still in the room was at times palpable.  Aaron�s use of art making became an expression of his protection from making an emotional connection to the disintegrated world around him.  It may also have led the way back to a sense of connection.

The experience of seeing Sip my Ocean felt closer to falling into than �wandering about�.  I felt elated to be sharing in the artist�s playful joining with the world.  The feeling was transmitted between artist and viewer through the artwork.  Such a blissful suspension in the aesthetic moment (Bollas, 1987) suggests surrender to unconscious experience that reconnects us to early experiences of a containing parental figure.  Psychotherapist, Mark Epstein broadens this thinking, he states, 

What Bollas implies, but does not formulate explicitly, is that subject and object lose their entitativeness under the spell of such moments.  Some might call it a loss of boundaries, but, alternatively, we might see such times as the opening of a window into the fabric of the mind that underlies our usual worlds of self and other (Epstein 2004, p. 32).

This intermediate space between self and other will be explored further in section three. 

The ephemeral qualities of such moments, when edges dissolve and fill us with sudden awe also host shadow emotional content.  The aesthetic moment is short-lived and its transient nature brings us up close to longing and loss.  Planning to come back to view �Sip my Ocean� again was perhaps an attempt to sidestep my own potential feeling of loss.  Art Therapist, Caroline Case states,  �these moments are fleeting-we experience their loss or sense their absence almost as we are lost in them� (Case, 1996, p. 44 ).  This may bear particular significance for Aaron in his attempts to make sense of the emotional devastation of bereavement.  

Mark Epstein describes his experience when viewing �Sip My Ocean� at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. 

I felt that the artist was communicating something of the creative play of emptiness that I recognised from my meditation experiences.  In the midst of my reflections, I noticed something inexplicable that I have felt in similar moments of meditation: a sweetness, or joy, that seems to come from nowhere.  The taste of mere existence, I thought to myself, and also the flavour of art (Epstein, 2004, p. 35).

These moments of inexplicable feelings offer a potential meeting place for connection between the therapist and the child in therapy.  Connecting across a gulf of emptiness and loss, the snake and the bird, unlikely partners, established a mutual arrangement.  Aaron had found a potent metaphor; perhaps expressing reciprocal characteristics of the therapeutic relationship, perhaps readying himself to re-engage and reconnect with the world around him.



5. Juxtaposition 3: Facilitating Environment

5.1 Transitional Space
Donald Winnicott (1971) describes an intermediate area of experience between the worlds of inner life and relationships with other people and the outside world.  Winnicott links this formless third space or �transitional space� to playing, creativity, spontaneity and intimacy.  �Transitional space� describes an area of interplay that opens up between the child and primary carer in which the child�s earliest creative gestures are recognised and responded to.  By meeting the baby�s needs, the carer sustains the illusion that what the baby creates from inner need really exists in reality.  These early experiences are essential to the later capacity to suspend the rigours of everyday reality.  
  
This intermediate area of experience, unchallenged in respect of its belonging to inner or external (shared) reality, constitutes the greater part of the infant�s experience, and throughout life is retained in the intense experiencing that belongs to the arts and to religion and to imaginative living, and to creative scientific work (Winnicott, 1971, p.16).

Held within the ripples of transitional space it seems it is possible to feel secure enough to stop treading water and simply float.


5.2 Mindfulness
From a Buddhist perspective, connection is already present; we are not as separate and distinct as we think we are.  Connection is our natural state; we just have to learn to permit it (Epstein, 1999).  Buddhism teaches a mental stance that is different from our usual means of perception in that it is simultaneously, both detached and receptive.  Practicing this method of awareness in meditation and every day life allows for a precise registering of whatever is happening in the mind and body.  The essence of mindfulness also called bare or naked attention, central to Buddhism, is an acceptance or tolerance for all of our experience.  Meditation in most traditions serves not only to calm and focus the mind, but also to begin to integrate the person: to bring body, mind, and action together (Rosch, 2004, p.39).  And as Mark Epstein states the potential for greater connectedness will follow.

�by giving people the means of being themselves, no matter what kind of vulnerability they are bearing, meditation prepares the ground for intimacy.  By teaching people how to be less self-conscious, and more accepting, of their own idiosyncrasies, meditation clears away some of the defensive rigidity that obscures the natural flow of love (Epstein, 1999, p. 75).

Just as the experience of transitional space is a natural process in childhood so he believes the state of �mindfulness� is natural to our being and that discovering it, or perhaps rediscovering it always involves a sense of recovery


5.3 Tea Ceremony 
The art of the Tea Ceremony belongs to the traditional Zen arts of Japan.  It has evolved over centuries as a way of self-understanding and as a means of practising true hospitality.  Through the peace of the garden and the secluded simplicity of the tea- room ceremony, the underlying philosophy of �perfect imperfection� guides the participant to find in the process of self-surrender the serene qualities of reverence, harmony, and tranquillity (Hammitzsch, 1979).  




5.4 Perfect Imperfection 
Perfect imperfection is used to describe the striving for perfection, which is incomplete, stopping just short of perfection.  The final completion is left to the sympathetic beholder.  Set within the seclusion of the tea garden the tea-room has about it a spirit both of perfect simplicity and of purity.  Natural materials used in the construction of the tea-room echo the simplicity of design.  Bamboo, wood, mud, reeds and straw are used and by their nature bring natural irregularity and imperfection to the structure (Hammitzsch, 1979). 


5.5 The Ink Painting
Sometimes a picture-scroll, kakemono, hangs in the alcove at the Tea Ceremony.  The picture is usually a simple ink drawing.  The Zen artist tries to suggest by the simplest possible means the inherent nature of the object.  The job of the artist is to suggest the essence, the eternal qualities of the object, which is in itself a work of art before the artist arrives on the scene (Lieberman, 2006). 

In order to achieve this, the artist must fully understand the inner nature of the aesthetic object, its Buddha nature.  This is the hard part.  Technique though important is useless without it; and the actual execution of the art may be startlingly spontaneous, once the artist has comprehended the essence of his subject (Lieberman, 2006, p.3).

The picture�s lines and dots etch out a melody of their own.  It comes to life only when that melody starts to sound in the heart of the beholder.  �In the Far East, understanding is achieved only when we can feel the resonance that a work produces within us, once we have truly grasped its innermost nature� (Hammitzsch 1979, p.92).





5.6 James Turrell   �Deer Shelter Skyspace�


Figure 6 James Turrell �Deer Shelter skyspace�

The weather was an improvement on the forecast for the day in that it was not actually raining, just that kind of heavy dampness in the air.  A large wet square area on the concrete floor showed that it had been raining sometime earlier.  I sit in a chamber excavated out of a hill, above me a square of intense light.  The light is a hole cut into the ceiling through which you may gaze upwards and watch the sky (figure 6 and figure 7). 

I was searching for movement in the bright whiteness of the cloud cover to gain some reassurance of what I was looking at.  My eyes wanted the light to be within a space; for the light to be a structure then a crow flaps across and it is the sky.  



Figure 7 James Turrell �Deer Shelter Skyspace�

The simple minimal interior helps restore calm and rest.  The old brick arches and stone slabs lining the walls connect to a solid earthliness as I contemplate the vast expansion of air that is the sky.  The mix of concrete and large stone slabs gives solidity to the base of things allowing the mind to drift.  This is a place of contemplation, timeless, watching the shifting patterns and the intensity of the light, enabling pause and meditation, where there is space for thought.  This is not an illusion of infinity but the actual linking of our lives to a larger entity, our place in the vastness of the universe.  


5.7 Case example 3
Cara had attended 10 sessions of Art Therapy.  In the early sessions she worked opposite me at the table using a selection of familiar type materials such as paint and clay.  In the eleventh session she became interested in some very large cardboard boxes (we had just had a materials delivery).  She told me that she played with boxes at home.  Cara constructed a house from the boxes.  She added a window with working shutters, a cooker and a sheltered area.  Sheets of blue paper were stuck to some of the interior wall.  It didn�t appear to matter that this wallpaper did not cover all of the walls; Cara seemed to be at ease imaginatively filling in the rest of the decorating and I think she expected the same of me.  The fixing points of the walls were pretty unsteady.  I worked with her to strengthen some of the joins.  She added domestic details like a rolling pin, a letterbox and a food shelf with supplies of wool spaghetti. 

Working quickly now, Cara began making a dog.  Fastening the legs to the body of the dog was tricky.  They were made from card as flat cut-outs and seemed at odds with the box like body.  Once in place the legs gave the dog a ridged appearance.  Cara placed the dog as if on guard inside the house.  I was invited into the house to meet the dog.  She told me the dog doesn�t like people who are afraid of him or make a fuss- he will growl and bite.  Cara told me the dog was protecting the house and was also there to keep her company.  

At the start of the next session Cara placed the 5 units of house creating space inside and outside the walls and spent time setting up the store cupboard.  She put new hinges on the door and made more efficient shutters for the window.  When she came to move the dog into position the dog�s legs fell off.  I felt concerned.  Perhaps if I had given some advice about a more stable method of attaching the legs this would not have happened.  How was a wobbly-legged dog going to keep this house safe?  Cara however seemed unfazed.  She re-stuck the legs along the dog�s body and roughly fashioned a dog basket from another box, adding a lilac cloth for a blanket (figure 8).  I felt joy and relief; as if I could breathe out having not realised I had been holding onto my breath for so long.  Something about seeing that dog settled and resting in a comfortable place felt right.    


Figure 8

For the remaining ten minutes of the session Cara said we should play.  I was to be an intruder in the house and steal the dog.  Cara rescued the dog from the thief and made the thief apologise to the dog and bring presents and food and a soft blanket.  The session ended with the dog tucked up in it�s basket under the sheltered part of the house (figure 9).

5.8 Discussion
This discussion uses ideas raised from the juxtaposition of an experience of viewing art with an excerpt from clinical practice to consider ways that we may extend our hospitality to moments of connection in Art Therapy.  It will consider the kind of space where connections can be made.  The discussion pays attention to a space, described by Winnicott (1971) as an �intermediate� or �transitional space�, which is between the worlds of inner life and relationships with other people and the outside world.  Winnicott links this formless third space to playing, creativity, spontaneity and intimacy.  Aspects of spiritual philosophy will shape the discussion.

The tea-room ceremony belonging to the Zen arts of Japan takes place within a secluded hut set in a tranquil garden.  Hammitzch describes his first experience of making his way to the tea ceremony 

The yellow foliage of the gingko trees, which enclose the garden against a range of hills, still radiates back the warmth of the dying day. �I follow a path laid with large, round, dark-hued pebbles.  Then I step through a gate made of bamboo wickerwork into the garden.  Here I come to a halt.  Is this garden really a world made by human hands?   It is an entrancing landscape such as one finds in the coastal valleys of the Japanese islands, a landscape that reflects all the characteristics of those valleys.  The visitor fancies that he can detect in the distance the roar of the sea, hear the playing of the sea breeze in the branches of ancient pines (Hammitzch, 1979, p. 11).
  
The garden has become a place to reawaken and play with the senses.  It holds a physical presence that gently rejuvenates an inner space.  The aesthetic experience of the serenity and beauty of the garden invites imagination and fancy as preparation for the ceremony to come.  The garden enables a shift into a space apart from the rigours of everyday life.  These qualities, essential to the true hospitality of the Zen Master, help us to consider the space that the therapist seeks to offer in Art Therapy.  We can also reflect upon the imaginary journey that the child and therapist may need to make before fully arriving in the therapy room.  

James Turrell also gives us a place away from the momentum of everyday life where it is possible to be still and look up to a window of light.  We are invited to gaze into an expanse, contemplate and meditate.  Turrell is nurturing a state of awareness that is both in touch with the earth and at the same time opening to the universe.  As I sat in the Deer Shelter I was struggling to hold near and far together.  I hoped for rain to help connect the sky and the ground.  Epstein (2004) tells us that from a Buddhist perspective, noticing and accepting such thoughts and sensations equates a state of mindfulness.  Maintaining a state of mindfulness begins the process of restoration of a sense of connection with all things.  Practising mindfulness helps us to stay in the present moment and give attention to whatever is happening in mind and body.  Such a mental stance, different from our usual means of perception, can help us think about the state of awareness we seek to maintain throughout a therapeutic session.  Attention to a state of mindfulness will help moments of connection to be recognised and experienced fully for what they are. 

Cara built her own space, a house and put in it all the things she needed.  Once the dog had settled into his basket Cara could start to play.  The house, under the care of the resting dog, became a space where Cara could just float and play.  As Winnicott tells us psychotherapy has to do with two people playing together (1971, p.44).  In setting up her place to play Cara created a material representation of Winnicott�s transitional space.

The dog temporarily relaxing its guard suggests it had found a safe place to inhabit and be still for a while.  Seeing the dog settled in a cosy basket just seemed lovely.  For a short while the dog did not have to defend the house.  In the same way that Epstein describes the process of meditation as creating the potential for greater connectedness, this action seemed to prepare the ground for intimacy and a greater experience of moments of connection through the play that followed.



6. Concluding Thoughts

6.1 Goat Story

A Chinese painter was once commissioned to paint the Emperor�s favourite goat.  The artist asked for the goat, that he might study it. After two years the Emperor, growing impatient, asked for the return of the goat; the artist obliged.  Then the Emperor asked about the painting.  The artist confessed that he had not yet made one, and taking an ink brush he drew eight nonchalant strokes, creating the most perfect goat in the annals of Chinese painting 
( Lieberman, n.d., p.3).


Figure 10 �First Goat�

Figure 10 was made in reflective practice whist thinking about the goat story.  The story had captured my interest.  I used to own a goat many years ago and I wondered how my attempt at a goat would turn out.  After my first picture I paused, remembered and considered my goat more fully then made another picture, this time showing my goat stretching to reach the juicy grass just at the edge of where she could reach on her tether (figure 11).      


Figure 11 ' Second Goat'

Hammmitzsch describes the process by which the Zen artist strived to capture the inherent nature of the goat.

The representation of an object in the picture is not undertaken because of its shape or form.  The Master�s one and only object is to transmit an experience-the �Oneness� that he himself has experienced as an initiate.  He absorbs himself totally into this �Oneness�, be it lotus, bamboo or crane.  He experiences the object�s innermost being and then represents it.  But the work becomes complete in the Zen sense only when his pupil has experienced the �Oneness� that resides within the work. Artistic appreciation is here turned into meditation.  And in this sense Japanese art is �frameless�- i.e., the picture is not limited by a frame, either in the physical or in the mental sense.  It places a high premium on the active participation of the observer (Hammitzsch, 1979, p. 93).

The painter of the goat needed time before painting as if the ordinary day-to-day stuff of goat husbandry infused the artist like a subtle marinade.  He captures the essence of the animal stopping just short of perfection.  As with the tradition of Zen painting, the final completion is left to the sympathetic beholder.  In a similar way Cara�s dog seemed to be a truthful representation of the spirit of the animal.  She needed me to bring my imagination; to be active in my looking.  Suspending reality within transitional space in this way can lead to a meeting of imaginations.  Art Therapist, Richard Learmonth highlights the potential of these moments.

And as with so much that makes Art Therapy unique, it is the special quality of the three way conversation between Maker, Image and Therapist that lends itself.  In this triangle therapist and client can, if they�re lucky, form some sort of joint witness to a previously inarticulate experience.  If this is successful, it can change everything.  It is a special form of addressing in which we resonate rather than react  (Learmonth, 1994, p.22). 

Learmonth is drawing attention to moments of resonance, where openness to receive the experience of connection without words holds significant therapeutic value.  Acceptance of our own vulnerability can direct the search for a more genuine attitude in the therapeutic relationship.  Buddhism teaches us to relate to the world with openness, acceptance, generosity and joy that begin with an acceptance of our own weaknesses.  

This dissertation has shown that moments of connection are a significant experience for children in Art Therapy.  It has considered the feeling of emotional connection within Attachment Theory and the experience of merger and shared experience that can accompany aesthetic encounters.  It has sought an understanding of where such wordless connections take place.  
The dissertation has juxtaposed the experience of looking at artwork from the culture of fine art and experiences from clinical practice with the view to refresh and strengthen this connection at the roots of Art Therapy practice.  Three discussions have considered threads of enquiry that resonate between the aesthetic experience of being with three pieces of art and how it feels to be with a client in therapy.  These discussions are intended to clarify and rejuvenate some of the fundamental aspects of the therapist�s task and stimulate interest for further investigation.  The essential role of imagination in processes connecting the child and therapist has been emphasised.  The therapist�s involvement in imaginative looking and �inhabitation� of the artwork can support and awaken the child�s senses in a similar way that the guest�s journey to the Tea Ceremony restores an inner space in preparation for the ceremony ahead.

The Zen artist requires a kind of attention from the viewer that is an active participation; a resonance in the heart of the beholder.  So too in therapy, with this kind of attention, moments can resonate in a real way between the child, the art making and the therapist.  Such moments constitute the vitality of the therapeutic work.

Winnicott�s (1971) concept of �transitional space� helps to locate the territory for these complex transactions.  Trust in the therapist allows the child to experience this curious intermediate area of experience between the worlds of inner life and relationships with other people and the outside world.  A trusting relationship grows out of real and true communication.  

Art Therapists can hone their skills in attunement, noticing the cadence of a child�s interactions.  They can give attention to the potential for moments when the child feels their inner state has been matched.  However attunement remains a genuine felt transaction that cannot be faked or manufactured.  Skill lies in sustaining our sensibility to receive these fleeting communications.  Attention to the state of mindfulness will bring and sustain a genuine attitude to the therapeutic relationship.  Moments of connection may then be recognised for what they are and experienced fully. Mindfulness offers the true hospitality of the Zen Master to moments of connection in therapy.

It is within the nature of Art Therapy that moments of attunement and aesthetic connections intertwine and overlay each other.  These moments hold potential for transformation and reintegration.  

The arrival of duende always presupposes a radical change in all forms as they existed on the old plane.  It gives a sense of refreshment unknown until then, together with that quality of the just-opening rose, of the miraculous, which comes and instils an almost religious transport (Lorca, 1934, p.5).
