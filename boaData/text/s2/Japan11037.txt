General    By October 1942 the danger of a Japanese invasion of India  in strength had to some extent abated and both sides were  deployed along the whole length of the Assam mountain barrier  with little large scale activity.    During the months following the withdrawal from Burma S.O.E.  had gathered together what remained of the Oriental Mission and  augmented it with officers and men who were well acquainted with  those countries recently overrun by the Japanese so that with  the beginning of a new campaigning season at hand a strong  nucleus was ready to return to the field.    October 1942 saw the turn of the tide. From then on while  the regular military forces were building up their strength from  a secure base S.O.E. began to go over to the offensive.    Burma  HISTORICAL SUMMARY.  From the outset there were two distinct areas in which S.O.E.  planned to operate. The first was in and forward of the Assam  mountain range. The second in the long chain of hills and  plateaux that extend along the whole length of Burma's Eastern  border. For the sake of clarity these must be considered  separately.    A. North West Burma  1. Special Operations Group  A small guerilla party led by British officers was  formed in the Tamu area early in 1945 and acted as a forward  outpost for 14th Army in that district until it /as withdrawn  as a result of the Japanese offensive against Imphal in  May 1944., Approximate  1.  2.  3.

In February 1944 five I.F.B.U's were attached to various  forward Divisions of the 14th Array on the Arakan and Imphal  fronts.    These units were continuously employed until the end of  June 1944 when they were withdrawn for refitting. Their work  had consisted of propaganda direct to the Japanese troops  opposing 14th Army propaganda to and trading with the  local population behind the Japanese lines and straightforward  Intelligence.    The five I.F.B.U's had their origin in a single Forward  Propaganda Unit which operated in the earlier Arakan campaign  of December 1942 -March 1943.    3. Contact with bhe Thakin movement Burmese Nationalist Party .  Since November 1943 various Burmese agents have been  employed in the Arakan establishing contact with certain  Communist members of the Thakin Party who are known to be  growing increasingly anti-Japanese.    B. North East East ana South East Burma  1. Kachin Hills  In March 1943 a small party was put into the area -North  East of Bhamo and W/T communication with India established.  During the months that followed additional officers and men  were added to the original group and a widespread Intelligence  system built up amongst the friendly Kachin tribes. The  local population wherever possible were armed and trained  in the rudiments of guerilla warfare and during the final  stages of General Stilwell's drive to Myitkyina assisted  the airborne columns of General Wingate in active operations  against the Japanese.    With the capture of Myitkyina the main body which had  been maintained by air for over a year was withdrawn to  India for resting and refitting. A small group equipped  with W/T remained behind south east of Bhamo and was withdrawn  this month., 2. Kokang  After considerable negotiations with the Chinese    Central Government a party of several British officers    equipped with W/T were parachuted into Kokang in December    1943. Unfortunately from the beginning they came into    conflict with the local Chinese authorities who without    doubt had territorial designs on this small strip of British    territory.    Operations in the area were originally planned to  safeguard the Eastern flank of the districts affected by  General Wingate's expedition and to build up an organisation  which would be of direct assistance to later moves by the  main land forces.    As a result of the difficult attitude adopted by the  Chinese on the spot it became increasingly evident that  Kokang was to be a test-case in respect of the future of the  Burma-China border and as a result this operation became  more a matter of politics tha S.Q. work.    In spite of representations and negotiations on the  highest level the Central Government either by design or  lack of authority seemed unable to bring about any change  of tactics amongst the local Chinese who as time went by  over and over again made it clear that it was their intention    to annex the territory.    From December 1943 onwards the original party was  considerably strengthened and continuously maintained from  the air. Recent Japanese moves against Yunnan have threatened  to encircle Kokang however and the party is therefore being  withdrawn until the situation eases.    3. Northern Bhan States  Operations were begun in this area in IViay 1944. The  first two parties went in overland from China but thereafter  they were reinforced and regularly maintained by aircraft    based in India., Approximate Totais   k   1. Locals organised for intelligence purposes guides etc. 500  2. Locals armed and trained 150-200  3. Officers put into the field. 8, -4-   During the monsoon period an organisation has been  built up amongst the local tribes and another link in the  overland L of G along the Eastern border of Burma is now  established. W/T comiunication with India has been maintained  from the outset and a widespread Intelligence system put  into operation.    4. Karenni  When the Oriental Mission withdrew North from Karenni  along with the regular military formations in April 1942 one  British officer remained behind in this area. In February  1943 the first attempt to re-establish contact with him and  the loyal tribes who inhabit the district -was successfully  made when a small party was put in from the air. Owing to  bad weather it was not possible to increase our strength on  the ground until October 1943 when another British officer  was dropped with W/T and a few men. Contact with the original  group was quickly made and another party put in the following  month. By the end of the year there were three W/T stations  operating and it was clear that a very considerable potential  existed in Karenni for large scale guerilla activities at a  later date against the vital road and rail lines of  communication which run through or nearby the territory.    Unfortunately in April 1944 a Japanese broadcast stated    that  they had captured one of the British officers and  liquidated most of his followers. Very shortly afterwards  the remaining two officers were reported killed and as a  result contact with this most promising area was lost.    5. Mergui  A W/T station was .set up on Elphinstone Island in the  Mergui Archipelago in January 1944. A second party was sent  in to relieve the first in April and it remained in position  throughout the whole of the rains until withdrawn early in  October 1944., -5-   The main task was to establish a W/T Relay Station  between between India and other operational groups in Malaya  and Siam but for reasons entirely connected with these other  groups little of this work was done. However a secure base  for reporting on enemy air and sea activity was established    which will be invaluable in the future.  e Andaman Islands South West Burma  A very detailed reconnaissance by a medium sized party led  by British officers was carried out in these Islands between  January and April 1943.    In addition to the foregoing certain other minor operations    f    have been carried out during the past two years. They are    summarised briefly below a  March 1943 Reconnaissance of the South West Coastal  district in the area of Danson Bay and  Foul Island.    b June/Oct 1943 Agents introduced into Rangoon to create  unrest amongst the Indian dock labourers.  c June 1944 Agent introduced into Mandalay to re-establish  contacts with pro-British faction.

An overland L of C has been established between the Kachin  Hills and the Northern Shan States and into Siam.  5.  The Central Andamans reconnoitred in detail.  6.  Contact re-established with many of those factions with whom  the Oriental Mission had begun to operate prior to May 1942.  SIAM  HISTORICAL SUMMARY        Early in 1943 Luang Pradit the leader of the Free Siamese  Movement inside Siaiji sent out three emissaries to China to get in  touch with the Allied Nations. As a result of their reports it  was decided that contact should be made with Luang Pradit and if  possible exfiltrate him by submarine.    An attempt to do this failed in November 1943 and plans were  therefore made to introduce two parties by air. The first of these  was put in in March and the second in April 1944. Nothing further  was heard of them for several months and reports from other sources  indicated that they had been captured.    However in August 1944 shortly after a change of Government, -7   had brought Luang Pradit's party into power in Siam W/T  communication with the two parties was established with India.    They reported that they were in friendly hands although their        movements were restricted and it was apparent that as a result  of the new internal situation they were in close touch with the  leader of the Free Siamese Movement.    Arrangements were made to follow up this success and another  party was put in by parachute early in September carrying a letter  from Admiral Mountbatten to Luang Pradit which stated tht.t he  would welcome any military assistance both direct and incidental  that the Free Siamese Movement might give to the main Allied forces    All three parties are now communicating regularly with India  and the position is most promising. Five prominent Siamese are  expected out shortly for discussion of future plans with S.E.A.C.    ACHIEVEMENTS.    1.  Contact established with Luang Pradit and the Free Siamese  Movement in Siam.  2.  Japanese installations and troop movements reported on  regularly.  MALAYA.  HISTORICAL SURVEY  The first and'main task in Malaya was to regain contact with  the Anti-Japanese Union the organisation which had been fostered  and. encouraged by the Oriental Mission prior to the fall of  Singapore and was by far the most disciplined and powerful  potential in the country.  In May 1943 a British officer 'with a small party of Chinese  was landed on the West Coast from a submarine. A second sortie  followed a month later and brought the original officer back to  India to report on his mission.       In brief he found that the A.J.U. claimed a membership of  80 per cent of the Chinese population with a smaller following  of Indians and Malays. The Anti-Japanese Force -a guerilla, -8   organisation v/ithin the A.J.U.-was estimated at 10 000 strong  and included those parties left behind by the O.M. in 1942.    A third sortie re-inserted the original British officer along  with another small group in August 1943. Since that date however  in spite of several attempts no further contact has yet been made  with out-parties on the ground.  ACHIBVSMBNTS.    I  1.

First hand reports received on conditions inside Malaya   SUMATRA    HISTORICAL SUmMARY    Sumatra to a large extent was and still is virgin  territory as regards S.O.E. work. Only two minor operations have  been carried out during the period under review.    The first at the request of S.E.A.C. was launched in April  1944 and samples taken of the soil in various coastal areas.    The second in June 1944 was a coup de main exploit resulting  in the successful capture and exfiltration of a Malayan Police  Sergeant for Intelligence purposes. Information obtained indicates  that the Northern areas of the island are not suitable ground for  future projects., 1.  In April 1942 with the concurrence of the prime  Minister of Australia and at the request of the Commanderin- Chief Australian Military Forces 3 0.F. lent to the  C.-in-C. two officers for the purpose of advising him  and setting up in Australia a 3.0. organisation. The  Secret name of this organisation is s.O.A. with the   Cover name of Services Reconnaissance Department s.R.D.  2.  S.O.A. has the full support of the three Service  departments and civilian authorities as required. As  far as operations within the S.W.P.A. are concerned it is  operationally controlled by G.H.Q. S.T.P.A.. It also  on behalf of S.O.E. India launches projects into S.E.A.C.  and provides as far as possible any other assistance  which S.O.E. India may require.  3.  S.O.A. is commanded by an S.O.E. officer and is  manned by officers ratings and O.R s provided by S.O.E.  and the Australian and Mew Zealand Services and civilians.  S.O.A. is not a Mission of S.O.E. but is greatly assisted  by S.O.E. who provide when requested by S.O.A. the  following   a  Advice regarding policy.   b  Technical personnel who are unobtainable in  Australia.   c  Technical information and equipment.   d  Finance.  4.

Avery brief summary of S.O.A s past  follows  a  Portuguese Timor.  A party was' established in October 194-2 and  communications have been maintained almost continuously  since then.    Since June 1943 this party has been the only contact  between Australia and this territory.

All these contacts should prove most  useful v/hen re-occupation of the area-is undertaken.

B  What we aimed at.   C  The potential as far as it con he  judged at the present.  In this paper I have dealt nith each country separately and have also  added two sections one on Pyschological Warfare and one on Industrial  Sabotage.   nothing in the paper will be new to you or V/CD to those Directors  who road my very long report of 8 months ago much will be familiar news If  you decide to circulate it it will I hope provide some of the information  which members of the Council have expressed themselves anxious to have.   Brigadier Guinness Iras read this paper and is in agreement that it is  a fair picture., i ir 1 o w'     i  S .O.E. E AR E A S T   GIStlERAL   li H   S.O.E. India derives its authority to vrork in the Eox East from two  sources.  In those countries v/ithin the South-East Asia Command it has authority  to act from the Supreme Allied Commander. Nothing is done in S.E.A.C. save  on his order. Therefore once our plans have been submitted through P.Division  which is the section of S.A.C.S.E.A s Staff which co-ordinates the activities  of all clandestine organisations and have received local J.P.S. approval they  cea.se broadly speaking to be S.O.E projects and become orders from S.A.C.   P. Division and J.P.S. in considering ou ''plans give weight to the cadis  we shall make on other Services -e.g. the Royal Navy the Army and the  R.A.F. -and assists us in obtaining the necessary priorities for submarines  aircraft etc.  As to China. we act as is always the case in a country with which   H.M.G. continues to maintain diplomatic relations under the general super  vision of the Foreign Office through H.M s Ambassador. We also.depend on  three agreements. Firstly a pact recently made between-S.O.E. and  Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shok concerning the Southern States Secondly a.  verbal agreement made between Lord Louis Mountbatten and the. Generalissimo  by which activities into S.E.A.C territory from Chinese soil were sanctioned.  Thirdly an agreement made between S.O.E. and the Generalissimo more than  two years ago concerning co-operation with certain clandestine Chinese  organisations-recently renewed and expanded by the Chinese D.M I.  It will he appreciated that in general S.O.E. work in the Pax East  is essentially different from work in Europe Most of the Asiatic people  have very little sense of patriotism and cannot be compared with the French  or the Dutch in their desire to wrest their country ffom the enemy. Large  numbers of them cannot be said to be pro-British or even pro-United Nations.  The most that can be said is that they are more anti-Japanese -thanks to the  enemy's intolerance of religion and violation of women -than anti anybody else   Further whereas in Europe it was possible to drop ..'bites who wdth  reajsono.ble good fortune could hope to escape notice it is impossible to drop  Europeans in Asiatic countries with any chance of their escaping detection  unless they can be dropped into an axea either known to be held by a  resistance group or a district in which they were well known in peacetime and  can gamble on a friendly reception from the local inhabitants. Moreover it  is frequently impossible for white officers to live on the land native food  must be reinforced by diet needed by Europeans these stores have to be intro  duced. by air frequently by a series of sorties uneconomical from the R.A.F.  point of view but governed by the size of the reception committee-.and its  capacity to deal with what is dropped.   Finally in most cases it is impracticable once contact has been  established to send in a steady flow of arms month by month. To do so would  be to invite one tribal chief to waste what we have sent him attacking his  neighbours. Therefore in general we must introduce arms merely for training  and rely on heavy droppings just before the time we wish agents to-go into  action.   In nil bar one of the countries in which we cro interested wc arc in   the position in the Far East in which we were in Europe 2/3 years ago. That   is to say we are in the process of laying down an S.O.E. .organisation of   establishing secret channels of communication of contacting people likely   to be willing to assist us -be it in sabotage in the rn.ising of Levies and   guerillas in the cutting of lines of c.pmraunication in spreading propaganda   which will dishearten our enemies and encourage our friends.   The only country where we have got beyond this stage is Burma because  it is only here that the Military plans axe so advanced that we know exactly  how wo cm and should put our organisation into action in support of those  plans.. I will therefore deal with Burma first.,  2  BURMA    The work that S.0.E-. has done and is planning to do in Burma falls  into three phases.    Our first objective was to build up a group of operational missions  on the hills on the Eurmo/Chinese frontier from the north to the South  since it is chiefly among the hill tribes that the spirit of resistance  is most likely to be found and is likely to be most active. There have  been four of these operational missions one among the Sachins roughly  between Bhamo and Myitkyina one into Kokang one in the northern Shan States  and one into Karenni covering a. territory roughly from Loikav to Moulmein .  Much of the territory of the Northern Mission to the Sachins has already  been liberated by the United Nations' troops advancing Southward. This  Mission has provided a great deal of intelligence has organised Levies to the  total of 1/2 000 and given considerable assistance to General .'ingate's  second expedition. It is at this moment attacking Japanese lines of  communication in the Bhamo/Lashio area. Similar tasks arc being carried out  by the Mission in the Northern Shan States and although the throe European  officers who wore leading the Mission in Karenni have been killed they have  left behind some form of organisation and a. spirit of resistance which can  be re-activated when the time comes.    Secondly S.O.B. has an operation into the Arakan to activate the  Thakin Party and subvert the B.D.A. throughout Burma with the following  results    1.  Contact established with an anti Japanese clique within  the Thakin Party and through it with the B.D.A.  2.  A nucleus of agents formed and already in the field all  of whom ha.d previously surrendered to the British as a  result of instructions passed by S.O.E to the Resistance  Centre.  3.  Good prospects of irregular resistance in the Japanese  rear axeas in support of 15 Corps' offensive in the  Arakan and when the time cornes throughout Burma.  Thirdly S.O.E. has sent into the centre of Burma the Andamans and  the Mergui Archipelago a number of parties whose chief object has been the  gathering of operational intelligence.    Now that S.E.A.C. is engaged in definite operations directed to the  capture of Mandalay S.O.E. has been instructed by the Supreme Allied Commander  to train administer introduce end direct 17 special operational groups .who  will be something in the nature of Jedburgh parties. Their task will he  threefold    1.  To give Military leadership to the various resistance  groups organised by S.O.E. officers.  2.  To co-ordinate these groups with the regular United  Nations Forces.  3.  I10 io special Sabotage work.  It.is estimated that from the Various agencies set out above S.O.E.  will during the coming campaign be controlling something like 5/6 000 men.,  3  MALAYA     S.O.E's hopes for Malaya bxo Lased cldofly hut not entirely on a  body known as the Anti-Japanese Union -.zhich is the lineal dosoendent of  the Malayan Coaununist Party. This party was declared illegal by the  British prior to the Japanese entry into the vror and in order to carry on  some of its activities reformed itself into the Anti--Enemy Tacking Up Society  the aim of which was to assist China in her struggle against Japan. The  money \/as collected amongst the Chinese in Malaya who form 2 1L of the  population and was sent to China. Boycotts were arranged and everything  possible done to embarrass the Japanese. Both the Malayan Communist Party  and the Anti-Enemy Backing Up Society arc keenly susceptible to two  external influences -one loyalty to China the other sympathy with  Communist Russia. In the early days of the war when Russia had sn agreomont  with Germany and England had done nothing to assist China in her  struggle against Japan the Anti-Enemy Backing Up Society was hostile to  British interests but this attitude was reversed when Russia come into  the war against Germany md both the Soviet and China occmc pent of the  United Nations. The leaders of Anti-lnomy Backing up society then came  to members of the Special Police in Singapore and offered to do anything they    could to help. On the order of both the Governor end the G.O.C. their  offer was d.oclined until the le.st days before the fall of Singapore. They  were then given arms and explosives and fought bravely to hold up the  Japanese advance. They succeeded in various places in checking the  advance for a dry or two but could not of course do more.    Just before the fall of Singapore leading members of tho Anti-Enemy  Backing Up Society came to an officer in the Special Police named Innes  Tromlctt now Head of our Malayan Country Section and asked for fin.' .  instructions. Trcmlett bold them that the British would most certainly be  back end that their duty wo.s to re-organise and strengthen their organisation  and do everything they could to resist the Japanese until our return. Some  40 Europeans and 110 Chinese who had been trained in S.O.E's school at  Singapore were left behind to encourage and organise the Anti-Enemy Backing  Up Society during the Japanese occupation.    In May 1943 an S.O.E. Officer who had previously been in the Police  landed blind by submarine mid contacted leaders of the Anti-Enemy Backing  Up Society now known as the Anti-Japanese Union. He was subsequently  exfiltrated mid later he and another officer returned to the A.J.U. II.Q. in  Malaya. Owing to the fact that their wireless sets were captured they  wore not able to keep R.V. with the submarine and wo have been out of touch  with them for nearly a. year.    In December 1944 however another S.O.E. party proceeding from  Australia landed on the coast of Johoro and have reported that they are in  touch with the local branch of the A.J.U. end through that branch with the    S.O.E. officers in the North.  The substance of the reports we have received from S.O.E. officers with  the A.J.U. is an     a  It is/cxtrcinely well organised movement containing a  Finance Dept. a Propaganda Dept. a school for training  guerillas a division for exerting economic pressure and  a section to carry out assassinations of Japanese officials  and to terrorize where possible collaborators.   b  While not pro-British it is intensely anti-Japanese and would  welcome the return of the British.   c  Morale is good and not only have our two officers who went  in in 1943 boon well treated bub an officer left behind from  S.O.E's Singapore Mission and also a representative of S.I.S.  are with the A.J.U. and are impressed -..dth their potentiality.   d  The great need of the A.J.U. is medicine and arms and  ammunition.  It would appear therefore that there exists in Malaya a well  organised body comprising 10 000 people which may be capable of fulfilling,  4  the following functions    1.  Attacking Japanese lines of couriunication.  2  Carrying out sabotage.    3.  Organising civilian resistance  4.  Receiving special parties from S.Q.B.  5.  Organising Reception Committees for Airborne  Divisions or regular invading Forces.  6.  Providing intelligence.  S.O.E. also plans to introduce a party which will make contact  with Malaya. This will be advantageous for political reasons but it  is not felt that in general the Inlays' offer good material for resistance  although their potential for. non-cooperation1 is considerable and they  form the bulk of the Government and Municipal Services.,  5  SIM   Over a year ago emissaries came out of Siam stating that there was  in that country a Free Siamese Prerty the. leader being Luang Pradit one  of the joint Regents which contained elements of all the Services Civil  Servants etc.    At first our endeavours '.-ere to exfiltrate Pradit hut a fairly   recent change of Government caused us to alter our plans. The quisling  Prime Minister Luang Pibul was put out of office and van replaced by a  member of the Free Thai Movement one Kovit Abhaivongsc Prndit s  colleague a... joint Regent resigned and Pradit is now sole Regent. Wo  therefore introduced two parties with the object of getting into touch  with pradit. They wore captured by the Siamese Police and we thought  that they must be written off but after an interval they came on the  air and informed us that they were being kept under the protection of Prndit.  Since that time there has been a. fairly regular flow of messages between  Pradit and ourselves. Every step in this transaction has of course been  done under the orders of S.E.A.C. and in close consultation with the  Foreign Office who ruled that while we may hold out no promise to Siam  that her integrity will be observed after the war we may urge them to co  operate with us in taking Military action against the Japanese. Sc far  all our parties -of which we ha.ve four -have consisted of Siamese but it  is intended as soon as possible to introduce a. high ranking British officer  to conduct high level negotiations with Pradit Pradit is also hoping to  exfiltrate one of Ms Military leaders for discussion with S.E.A.C.   I-o is not thought that the Siamese Army whose loaders are in the  main anti-Japanese could put up effective resistance against the enemy but  arc entitled to hope that a.s the result of our conta.ct -with Pradit and the  Free Thai. Movement we can influence the Free Thai Movement so that it ould  carry out or assist in carrying out the following tasks   1.  The reception of special parties for specific arts  of sabotage  2.  The arrangement of reception for airborne troops  should it he decided to send them.  3.  The marking of land falls in the event of invasion  by sea.  4.  General resistance to Japanese authority a.t the la.st  minute.  5  A widespread and regular intelligence system. This  is in fact already in existence -information of a high  standard being received.,  S  FREITCII IKDO-CSI. A   S.O.E. India has 'boon engaged since about Au.ust 1943 in the   preliminary work in connection with the organisation of resistance in F.I.C.  Whereas in Prance we worked with a civilian resistance movement we expect  to work in F.I.C. almost entirely with the French Forces at present stationed  there numbering about 54 000 of whom 15/20 000 are Europeans A  civilian resistance movement is also being organised but it is not coiTpurablc  in size and we do not anticipate that it will be nearly so effective as the  Military side.  F.I.G. is not theoretically a Japanese occupied territory but is  theoretically collaborating with the Japanese. The French Colonial Array  retains its arms and our great concern is that no action to disarm these  troops should be taken by the Japanese before wo arc in a position to assist  the French with supplies of material and with reinforcements. The loaders  of the French Army in F.I.G. have stated that the Army will resist such dis  armament and we have evidence that it is the Japanese intention to effect  disarmament as soon as they feel that this is necessary  /was until recently/  The F.I.C. Section of S.O.E. India is composed almost entirely of    French officers and ' headed by Commandant do Langla.de a first cla.ss man  who has worked with us since August 1943 and who has recently been appointed  Senior Representative in the Far East of the French Services .Spociaux   D.G-.E.R formerly B.C.R. A. .   Until about throe months ago our activities had consisted of negotia  tions and planning. The negotiations consisted principally of overcoming  the obstruction of the Americans who at one time appeared determined that  Franco should not regain control of F.I.C Although vc have no direct  evidence it is certain that America is now reconciled to the fact that  France is determined to regain her control of this territory. Chinese  aspirations.in this connection which were encouraged by America's previous  attitude have now given place to ail acceptance of Franco's position and we  believe that negotiations are now going on between China and France for a treaty  concerning F.I.C which would have the effect of a. renunciation by China  of any claims which they might lia.yc thought they had to F.I.C. Although  America is no longer likely to Oppose the control of F.I.C. by France they  have shown reluctance in agreeing to our plans to assist France to that wad  aoid have on several Occasions reit. rated that F.I.C. is in the China Command  and therefore in a sphere of American influence. They have suggested to the  French that the liberation of F.I.C. should bo effected in conjunction with  the Americans and not the British. In view of the Americans' previous  attitude the French do not think much of this idea not only do they prefer  to work with us they show the utmost reluctance to working with the Americans.   The political considerations mentioned above hampered but did not  stop our work which has made steady progress. In May of last year an  operational plan of three phases was submitted to S.E.A.C. by 5.C.M. India.  The plans were based on the assumption that the Japanese will eventually  attempt to disarm the French and take over complete control. The phases   were -      a  Organisation of a resistance movement with  system to India for immediate implementation.   b  Harrassing action sabotage and demolitions  lines of communication after Japanese occupation.   c  Organised and sustained resistance by  according to circumstances of the French-armed forces.  The personnel roruired for the implementation of our plans vill bo  entirely or almost entirely French. A few of these have already been  introduced and. there remain a.t present in India raid available for operations  about 150 Frenchmen. Further the Corps Legor d'Intervention C.L.I.  which has recently been renamed the 5th Regiment has been specially recruited  and trained in North Africa under Li.Colonel Iluard and we arc now actively  engaged in arranging their transportation to Ceylon. This unit will be used,  7  by us as a reservoir of specialised personnel from which we shall draw our    requirements for S.O.E. activities in F.I.C In addition Officer and N.C.O.    specialists will be sent  in to be attached and to act as stiffening to the    French Forces.    In July of this year de Langlade was dropped in F.I.C. and saw General  Mordant who had recently retired from the position of C-inSC. of the French  Army in F.I.C. ostensibly on the grounds of having reached the age limit but  actually to become Hoad of the resistance movement. De Langlade's Mission  was a complete success not only did he see General Mordant but he saw his  successor General lyme who is likewise prepared to play with us. De  Langlade came to Europe to report and to press for the despatch as an accredited  mission of General Blaizot end his staff. General Blaizot has been appointed  by de Gaulle to command the Forces Expoditionnaires Francaises pour I'Extrome  Orient F.E.F.E.O. . As far as the Far East is concerned this Force only  exists on paper since the participation of French Troops in that theatre has  not yet been accepted by the Americans or ourselves. The influence which  General Blaizot wields in Military circles in F.I.C. where he was until    1936  Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief is such that S.O.E. has given    the strongest possible support to the French proposal that Blaizot and his    Mission should be accredited to S.A.C.S.E.A.    In spite of repeated attempts we have not been able to obtain the  assent of the Combined Chiefs of Staff to the Blaizot Mission but evidence  which we were able to produce that the French were dissatisfied at British  dilatorincss and were being thus thrown into the arms of the Americans  eventually caused the P.M. to agree in October without further reference  to the Americans to the retention of the Blaizot Mission as a. permanent  Mission to S.A.C.S.E.A. to whom he had already proceeded on a visit.    The essential minimum of phase a of the plan referred to above  has now been completed. This consisted of the introduction of 11 Yf/T sets  of which 10 arc in regular communication with our India H.Q. and small  stocks of small arms ammunition and explosives.    Further supply drops arc continuing up to the maximum air lift  obtainable.    De Langlade has ma.de another visit to F.I.C. In addition Colonel  Huard the Commanding Officer of the 5th Regiment has gone in to convey  General Blaizot1p Military instructions to tho Army Authorities in the country.    In connection with these infiltrations some Army Officers wore exfiltrated  bringing with them Military Intelligence from General Mordant.  These Officers have recently been re-introduced and Colonel Huard lias come out.  Organisers W/T Operators and sabotage exports have boon dropped and many more  arc standing by.    Phases b and c will not be carried out until either the Japanese  attempt to disarm the French Army or S.A.C.S.E.A. orders the resistance  movement to begin offensive action.    In connection with phase b some 200 targets have already been  selected and provisionally planned by the F.I.C. Section which has made a  very thorough study of tho whole question of sabotage in F.I.C. and sub  mitted plans in connection therewith. These targets of which about 75%  are aimed at communications the balance being approximately divided between  industrial undertakings and stocks may be classified as follows    1.  Communications a Railways Workshops Installations Bridges and  permanent ways.   b  R   c  TeloGommunications Radio Stations Transmitters  Telephone lines and Exchanges.   d  Canals Locks Fuelling and other Installations.   e  S,  8  2. Industrial and  Commercial   a Factories -Rubber Jute Chemicals and Munitionsj  Alcohol Distilleries.   b Mines -Coal Bauxite Molybdenum.   c Foundries mid Ship-building yards.  3. Stocks and  Depots  Japanese owned Food Rubber Wood Cotton Oil and  Petrol Naval and Air Force Stores.   The targets planned cover the whole country and if carried out would  effectively wreck communications and industry.    Any further sabotage required by the Allied Military Command could  of course be undertaken within the limits of their capabilities by the  resistance groups led by the specialists who will be introduced by S.C.E.  for that purpose.    Phase c consists principally of guerilla activity by such personnel  of the French Army as can maintain their existence as organised units and  their maintenance will depend on the extent to which they can ho supplied  with arms ammunition food and medical supplies.    The implementation of phases h and c will depend almost entirely  on the provision of the necessary air lift. Details of our requirements in  this connection have been worked out and given to S.E.A.C.    H.Q. S.E.A.C. has approved-phases a and b but cannot afford  the arr lift to support French Military Forces for phase c until air or  sea bases closer to F.I.C. become available.  l,  9  SUMATRA    All opora' ions into Sumatra aaid the Netherlands East Indi.es  generally are carried out in co-operation with tho Dutch Authorities  raid an Anglo-Dutch Section exists in Ceylon for the purpose of planning  and executing these operations.    Considerable difficulty bos boon experienced in .ranking' with  the Dutch as they do not fully understand the principles of S.O.E. work  mid consider their aiain task is    1. Collection of intelligence and  2. Raids of a. Commando nature.  Up to now only five operations have been conducted in Sumatra one  in the nature of reconnaissance at the request of S.E.A.C. and from  information received it would appear that the Northern areas of the Island  are not very suitable ground for future projects.    Nevertheless it is hoped to introduce two small parties in coast  watching roles in the near future.,  10  CHINA    In China wo have four foundations laid down after many long months  of work following a disastrous initial start on which to build.    indirect subsidy some remote control of a. secret organisation controlled  by the Chinese D.M.I.    Although the principal object of this Organisation which has agents  throughout China in Manchuria and also in Japan is the gathering of  high level intelligence we know it to bo capable of subversion strike  provoking spreading of rumours and on occasion the arranging of sabotage  both industrial and directed against military objects.    Secondly for a long period our officers working under the cover of  M.I.19 which is responsible for helping prisoners of war to escape have been  contacting people and reconnoitring in the South East China. Provinces. Until  recently we could do no more than reconnoitre since the Generalissimo  objected to any British organisation making contact on the soil of China   even though it were occupied by the Japanese with anybody politically  opposed to him. Recently however S.O.E. has obtained from Chiang Kai Shck    authorities in the South China Provinces -with the object of organising    resistance to the Japanese and providing those who arc organised with arms    instruction and supplies.    General Carton de Wiart has returned to London and it appears that ho is    willing to press the Prime Minister and the British Chiefs of Staff for    approval in principle to our plans.    launched over the Chinese frontier various parties into Burma F.I.C. and    Siam.    Fourthly there is the organisation known as REMORSE of which the objects    from enemy-occupied territory commodities which Britain urge . . needs    chiefly quinine.    inevitable that in carrying out its work it pays considerable sums in bribes or  allows people to earn large amounts as rake-off -and thus enables H.ivI.G.  through S.O.E. to influence many people not only financiers who get their  commission but also various Generals and par Lords other beneficiaries are  those groups of people called guerillas but -who are in truth better described  trading companies who exact tolls in some form or another on all goods which  pass through the area under their control.    What then is the S.O.E. potential in China    .7'e can hope by Psychological ITarfare -which is more fully referred to    threatening to cut den.n    activities.

Bell .    Subject to very long term directives which are issued by the P.Vf.   japan Committee sitting in. London the P W. Division of S.E.A.C. carries out  psychological.warfare throughout the whole of the Par East including China  although this country is of course not within the S.E.A.C. area. Neverthe  less it hoe been agreed with H.M 's Ambassador Chungking that provided  directives are approved by him the P.W Division S.E.A.C. shall operate  throughout China.    To say that the P.W Section of.S.O.E. India works closely with P.W.  Division S.E.A.C. is to understate the case. For a very long time S.O.E.  wo.s the only organisation in the Par East which had the trained officers  and the machinery to carry out most forms of Black Psychological Warfare and  therefore it was not surprising that when at last S.E.A.C. formed its P.W.  Division a number of our officers were appointed to it.    I I Thus Lieut.Colonel Peterson Director of S.O.E. P.W. Section is also  Deputy Director and Controller of Black Propaganda in S.E.A.C. P.W. Division.    Lieut. Colonel Peter Grieve is the Chief P.W. Officer of S.O.E's Calcutta    mission and at the same time Officer in Charge of P.W. Division's forward    oase at Calcutta. Richard Price is Controller of P.W. in China for S.O.E. and    is 2 i.C. of P.W. Division's forward base in Calcutta. This duplication    of office is of course anomalous but has in practice proved to work    extremely well    The task of P.W. Division S.E.A.C. may be summarised as that of  breaking down the morale of lajjanese troops of. frightening collaborators  of raising the morale of resistance elements in occupied areas and of  assisting these elements in every way with antj-Japanese and pro-Allied  propaganda.    This function is of course carried out by two means -direct and  indirect -and S.O.E. is scarcely concerned with direct means.    Indirect propaganda is disseminated in two ways. Firstly through    clandestine distribution of White Propaganda i.e. the dissemination by    clandestine means of facts which are correct and non-subversive but which    would never be distributed in certain areas but for the use of underground   channels. This task is carried out almost entirely by S.O.E. by I.F.B.Us   towhichfurtherreferencewillbemade andbyagentswhoareableto  penetrate enemy areas. Secondly by the clandestine distribution of  Subversive or Black Propaganda. This is almost exclusively the task of    S.C.E. and comprises the spreading of rumours and the circulation of leaflets.  The machinery of the P.W. Section of.S.O.E. is simple. A P.W. Officer  is attached to every Country Section and as soon as that Country Section is  able to put parties of any size into the field other P.W. Officers go forward.  For example if and when we establish contact and control of various guerilla  groups in Southern China P.W. Officers 'will be attached to those groups to  organise the.dissemination of rumours Views end leaflets which in conjunction  with other methods used elsewhere is hoped will effectively attack the  morale of Japanese troops.    In Burma much of this type of work has been done by S.O.E's I.F.B.Us   Indian Forward Broadcasting Units which have won official praise from  General Slim and appreciation from Corps Division and Brigade.    In the last campaign S.O.E. load four I.F.B.Us in the field in Burma  each being allotted a territory of many hundred square miles in areas  stretching from the Chin Hills in the North down to the Arakan. Each    I.F.B.U. consisted in the last campaign of about 60 men -it is proposed  to increase their size with the authority of General Slim to about 200 -and  as well as carrying broadcasting apparatus Japanese speakers and morcitrs  for distributing leaflets each Unit is responsible for its own transport and  its own. defence.,  12  I.P.B.Us operate in two ways. Sometimes they set up their loud  speakers within a fey/ hundred yards of the Japanese bunkers and send out a  programme of impromptu speeches gramophone records and so on. There is  also a broadcasting station in Calcutta which emits programmes which can be  picked up and re-transmitted. Extensive use ha s so far not been made of this  owing to the difficulty of timing -since it is not often possible to get a  lull in the fighting to coincide with the particular programme the station  is sending out.    The second way. in which I.P.B.Us work is hy the operation of  trade markets. The unit goes into an area either betwe'en the lines or  behind the Japanese lines and sets up a market selling at reasonable prices  what the natives want most chiefly salt and cloth. These markets afford  opportunity of general speeches by the officer in charge the gathering of  intelligence the launching of rumours and the infiltration and exfiltra.tion  of agents from enemy territory.    It is noteworthy that although the totals of Japanese troops  surrendering have not been considerable in practically every case during-the  last campaign when Japanese troops surrendered they came bearing surrender  tickets distributed by I.P.B.Us.    In Burma also was launched what is known as operation BILLET -a P.W.  operation the object of which was to establish contact with the anti-Japanese  section of the Thakin party. The results are extremely satisfactory and have  been dealt with under the Burmese Section of this paper. It is also note  worthy that agents introduced into the middle of Burma well to the South were  the cause of people surrendering to the British on the Arakan front.    Operations directed against the Japanese themselves are of course  co-ordinated at the top and every channel in every country is used A good  example of this is operation GRACIE.    The objects of this operation are to persuade the Japanese both in the  field and in Japan that so many Japanese prisoners of war have been found to  have left-wing-tendencies and a desire to assist the United Nations in ending  the war that special camps have been established in India for training them  in P.Y/. activities on behalf of the United Nations There is some basis of  truth in this rumour and in fact camps have been established for this purpose  in Bengal under the control of I.P.B.Us and in Delhi under the control of    D.M.I. India  This rumour has been spread hy individual agents in Burma by I.P.B.Us  and by officers of S.O.E. attached to B.A.A.G-. working in the South China  States. It is being supported by letters sent to residents of Japan from  fictitious addressed in Europe and Eastern countries. While the names of the  senders are fictitious the names of the addresses ace real and have been  obtained from the Secret Palestine Censorship. Even if these letters do not  all reach their addressees it has been proved elsewhere that censorship officials  are always a good source for the spreading of rumours since they always tend to  tell someone of any remarkable statement they have foul d and suppressed.    Another P.W. operation which may he quoted is NONCHALANT by which  40 highly skilled Chinese working in a. Hong Kong dockyard for the Japanese  have been persuaded to leave and have been exfiltrated to China. Another  40 are on their way. The intention was to place these skilled operatives at  the disposal o ° the Admiralty but for various reasons chiefly the refusal  of the Indian and Colonial Governments to import Chinese labour this has so  far not been possible.    A rumour campaign is now being conducted in the South China coastal  areas among the Chinese seafaring population to the effect that the vrooden  ships being built by the Japanese axe not seaworthy and that a large proportion  of them founder after leaving port. This rumour is in turn being supported  by other rumours concerning the remarkable secret weapons that the United  Nations have produced for sea warfare.    The recently proposed extension of S.O.E. operations to the China theatre,  13  offers great opportunity for the increase of P.V. activities in particular  for attack on Japanese morale. Not only shell vre he able to much increase  circulation of rumours of the G-RACIE type but v/e shall also be able to  intensify what is probably the most effective line of approach to the  Japanese -rumours calculated to increase nostalgia and to throw doubt on  the state of affairs at home.    To sum up methods by which Black Propaganda will he distributed  in China are     a  Through our own P W. Officers working in the South  China States.   b  Through the U.S. Air Force in co-operation with O. f.I. .  in one instance this has already been successfully  arranged and can' probably be developed. Note 0. .1.  because it is an open official American body under the  State Department is not part of P.W. Division S.E.A.C.     c  Through Chinese Military leaders by means of a. specially  recruited and separate Chinese staff ..ho would ostensibly  merely be supplying material at the request of Chinese  Commanders in some cases this has already been arranged.   d  By using the extensive Secret Chinese Organisation  controlled in pant by Findlay Andrew and referred to in  the section headed China.. This Secret Orgorisa.tion has  a very fine printing establishment in Chungking which I  have myself seen and which is a curious blend of modern  machinery and ancient printing methods. It is no doubt  an extremely efficient press functioning in a modern  building and capable of turning out leaflets in laxge  quantities and in every language with which we are concerned  -in the Fax Bast. The use of this press would have two    advantages -firstly the tremendous saving of weight in    traffic over the Hump and secondly as a safeguard in the    event of trouble with either the Chinese or the Americans    when  it would be possible to put a great part of S.O.E's    P.V/.  activities in China under cover of the Chinese    Organisation.    Finally there is a further sort of psychological warfare which S O.E.  may undertake in the East although if we do so it will be only at the request  of the Colonial Office and the Ministry of Supply.    This project is for the spreading of propaganda to encourage natives of  enony-occupied territory to conserve com odities which will be urgently  needed after the war chiefly rubber and tin. Meetings axe pending with the  Colonial Office in the hope that a price may be fixed and that we-shall be  given instructions as to where the natives are to hoard their stocks.,  14  II-iDUSTRIAl SABOTAGE   The territories occupied by Japan are not developed industrially and  with a few.exceptions mentioned below there are no industrial targets  outside Manchuria Korea and Japan the obliteration of which would  seriously affect Japan's war effort.    What Japan collects /from the occupied territories is almost entirely  raw products which arc carried to Japan for refining and processing.' These  for example comprise food grains raw rubber minerals and similar bulk  products. To attack these at their source is not practicable. They may  become vulnerable when collected and stored at main ports and most certainly  do when freighted to Japan in such a. case the targets become the ports  and port facilities at the major collecting' points storage godovms at these  points and above all the shipping carrying the products to Japan. Associated  with these are of course the .railways that feed the products for shipment to  the collecting ports e.g the F.I.C. railway serving Hanoi Haipong and  Saigon or that feeding Singapore.    The exceptions to the general statement contained in the foregoing  paragraph arc     a the oil storage and refineries in the N.E.I.   b  the facilities for docking and building ships at a few  ports such as Hong Kong and Singapore   cj wooden ship building which may be going on at a   number of places j     d  certain cement works -there is no over-all shortage of  cement but to save shipping chc Japanese appear to be  making cement locally in safe places to meet local chiefly  Military requirements and   e  the important coal mines in North China belonging to the  ICailan Mining Administration must he included for from  them by rail and by sea through their port at Chinguangta-o  coal suitable for coking is sent to the iron industry  centres in Manchuria and ' yashu.  At present we have three operations definitely planned against oil  storage targets in the N.E.I. One at Pankalan Socsoe in Sumatra which is  timed for early next yean. One against the installations in Bolikpapan in  Borneo which is awaiting approval of G.H.Q. S.W.P.A 1-and a scries of operation  also subject to S.W.P.A. approval against oil storage targets on Islands near  Singapore namely Sembu Bukom Sobarok and Tanjong IXban.    Early next year a party will leave by submarine to attack industrial  targets in the Hong Kong neighbourhood.    A vast amount of information dealing with the movements of shipping  railway development rail and road transport and the production of various  commodities has been collected by //CD's Directorate and by Miskin The bulk  of this information has reached us from the Par East where of course M.E.Y4  proper has a branch and much of it has come from our oen office in Chungking.  Directors who wish for more information should approach j/CD.,  15  RELATIONS WITH O.S.S.    Finally to complete the picture reference should he made to two  developments affecting clandestine organisations in the Far East    The first is the agreement -the framework of which was worked out in  Washington by A.D and General Donovan and which we trust will he finally  ratified in Kandy shortly -that in the whole of the Far East there shall  be the closest co-operation in long-term planning between S.O.E and O.S.S.  starting with the Force Commanders and working docn to the lowest level  feasible.    The immediate result should he the elimination of the feeling of  frustration hitherto caused by late disclosure of plans which has led to  charges that one organisation has tried to exclude the other shortly the  division of territory either on a geographical or functional basis. Later  it may produce joint projects carried out by parties of mixed SOE/OSS  membership.    Thesecond isthedesireexpressedbyGeneralWedemcycr G-.0.C.American  troops in China and Chief Staff Officer to the Generalissimo for some fpr .a  Within his Command of a p. Division to co-ordinate Anglo/U.S. clandestine  organisations.    This has been agreed in principle by the Supreme Allied Commander and  the Head of P. Division and'by C.D. and O.S.Sj while there is also strong  indication that General Donovan would agree. There is at present some slight  hitch believed to concern points raised by General Carton dc Wiart but there  is no doubt that the difficulties will be overcome. If General Yfedemoyor  becomes a Supreme Allied Commander -and we knew that the President will not  permit this until the present threat to China is overcome -he will no doubt  have a properly constituted P. Division.    Until then there will be a shadow P. Division comprising a British  co-ordinating officer and an American co-ordinating officer who will by  consultation with each other and with General Wcdcmoyer achieve much the same  effect.,  16  CONCLUSION    As I said in the first pages of this paper all that has been  attempted is to show very briefly what 3.0 33. Par East has done in each  country so far what it hopes to do and what at best is the dividend  which may be exooctod.    In general the practice followed has been that approved by you for  several years namely first penetration and the establishment of /'  coKMunicaiions then the contacting of groups or individuals either  friendly to the United Nations or hostile to the enemy and finally the  building up of independent groups organised for various purposes such as  general armed resistance the spreading of propaganda the carrying out of  particular operations or the provision of reception facilities for  regular forces which may arrive by sea or air.    It will -bo appreciated that in some countries of which Malaya and  Siam are good examples the position of 3.O.E. is comparable to our position  in France over three years ago -that is to say we believe there are  people .with whom wo can co-operate in the country and we are developing our  contacts. Just as in 1941 there was no S.H.A.S.P. and indeed I think no  C.C.S.S.A.C. to give S.O.E. general guidance over France so with regard  to Malaya there is no one to give us more than a very nebulous guidance  since no Military plans are extent concerning Malaya for operations earlier  than 1946 and we are unaware of any plans for Siam.    Therefore all wo can do is to strengthen our ties with the Anti- Japanese Union and with Pradit not knowing whether wo shall ever want bo  use them at all whether wo shall want to use only.some of the facilities  they offer o.g the spreading ex propaganda to undermine Japanese morale  or the hoarding of commodities or whether o shall wish to bring into play  everything they have to give including the raising of a considerable force  of armed men which would require heavy supplies of arms and possibly a  considerable number of European leaders.   It //ill also be appreciated that outline plans submitted by S.O.E.  to P. Division and the Joint Planners S.E.A.C. indicate a maximum air lift  which will be needed. If the full total of sorties cannot bo conceded to  us that is not to Say that ail our plans are void since they ben bo  properly developed on a smaller scale if S.A.C.S.E.A. so directs.    It will also be borne in mind that it is unlikely that all our plans  -°r the countries with which we are concerned .ill come to fruition at the  same time. Therefore whixe the toed of sorties required will be largo  the number of aircraft needed will not necessarily be as great as the total  indicated -o.g. I assume that the operations of special groups in Burma will  be over before any considerable operations are required to bo carried out in    any other country.    As to pa.ro.-Military operations in China. those responsible for S.O.E.  planning either in London or in the Ear East arc famed with the difficulty    chat we do not know for which Allied Commander we shall be acting. If  China does not collapse I think the most likely chance is that wo shall be    acting in support of General Wedemeyer But there is a good likelihood that  we may bo required to do something in support of S.A.C.S.E.A. in any advance  he may make from the West. There is also the possibility that we may be    called upon to take action to assist General MacArtbur should the Combined  Chiefs of Staff alien him after the capture of the Philippines to switch South  . 'est to Singapore or in aid of operations which Admiral Nirnitz may carry out  against Formosa. This difficulty applies purely bo para-Military operations    a.s of course the duty of attacking shipping and of undermining the Japanese  morale remains with us., , 5.P.B.

Later the organisation in Persia was handed over to the  Middle East but a wireless station has been maintained at  Quetta which works largely for the D.I.3. India.    We have maintained our Officer in Afghanistan in the  position of 1st Secretary of the.Legation where he has done  very useful work for D.I.B and D.M.I. We are at the moment  considering.posting him away from Kabul.    With the defeat of the German Army at Stalingrad the threat  to Persia evaporated.     D Contact with Q. Kission  In January 1942 we had a visit from 0.100 and K/L.5 and  arrangements were made for giving assistance to Schools in Burma  and for the supply of stores to Burma. These stores enabled  our parties in Burma to carry out some useful Wprk during the  retreat.     E Guerilla Organisatlon on the Indo-Burma Border  Early in 1942 we set about the formation of a Guerilla  Force on the Burma Border. This Force was later taken over  by G.E.Q and is now known as V. Force.    We were responsible for and carried out at our School  at Kohima the initial training of this Force.     F Post-and Pre-uccupational Defensive K Denial work in India.  At the same time as the threat to India Increased we  organised two bodies to form internal Resistance Groups in  occupied territories the first in collaboration with the Indian  Communists the second using a senior native Indian Civil Servant  and the Moslems of East Bengal.    Be also established a counter-Rumour Organisation which  worked satisfactorily and which has only recently been closed.  This Rumour Organisation undoubtedly did much to counter the  dangerous and sometimes inflammatory rumours which were spreading  in India during this critical period.    By the end of May 1942 we had also organised and trained  a party to carry out demolition of power stations and other  important targets in the Calcutta area., Urn  ffe a.0  m  %al weri  atssd fr Si apgro to  i fwar f foUewsi t  to itMr w toim Mmmt  mm. ia Pewter 1341 aet ap  Gavamo of yiasm to  of it r&oii 4 pMses    1 t luatohm mm orajintiwf aaa IM Igr isrittoi'i oftimm DrwMiag pEldea   M for tbe te alsr i smsaa flu the iwkM..

The Oriental Mission O.M. of S.O.E. was established in Singapore in  May1941 ThelastofficerofthatmissionleftSingaporeonApril12th1942  three days before the fall of Singapore Agents were left behind in Malaya  and when again contacted in May 1943 it was discovered that they had been active  in the interior in organising anti-Japanese activities.    AGHiMamrs.  T11 December l i L     1 /trained Englishmen numbering 40 and Chinese numbering 110 were put into  Malaya behind the Japanese lines. They were provided with stores and money  and promise of their being contacted later was made. It was not until May 1943  that contact was made by a small party led by a British officer and introduced  by submarine. It was then ascertained that some of the Europeans had survived  and were working. She Chinese had done exceptionally good work. They were the  beginning of all subsequent resistance in the whole of Malaya. They had or  ganised an anti-Japanese university for training in all forms of anti-Japanese  activity. They also organised an anti-Japanese force with ramifications  throughout the peninsula. The officer introduced in Hay 1943 brought back  valuable military and political intelligence. In August 1943 another party led  by two British officers was introduced by submarine but no contact has since  been made with them and it is believed that their W/T equipment fell into  enemy hands.   2 Prior to the fall of Penang in December 1941 the electric light works were  blown up by S.O.E. the tin-amelter was put out of action and military dumps of  aviation spirit were destroyed.   3 Escape routes from Malaya through Sumatra were organised in January 1942.  By means of these routes a considerable number of British service men were able  to reach Fadang in Sumatra. One small party sailed across the Bay of Bengal  and reached Ceylon in a small native sailing craft under S.O.E. guidance.   4 A separate propaganda unit was organised in August 1941 for attacking  Japanese and Japanese-occupied territories and for printing the necessary  material. Radio and press attacks were organised to operate against Japan  from the American continent from Australia and from the Philippines. A  research unit to assist in this propaganda work was organised at Singapore and  when subsequently evacuated to India was taken over by the Par Eastern Bureau   M.O.I. . Prior to the opening of hostilities with Japan this propaganda  unit had considerable success in obtaining secret documents embarrassing to  Japan and was able to introduce into Japan pamphlets specially prepared for the  purpose criticising Japan's aims and methods.     5 In October 1944 a party was landed in Johore from submarine based on  Australia. The operation was successful and contact was made with the leaders  of the anti-Japanese organisation mentioned in 1 above. Reports concerning  the anti-Japanese organisation haws been received. It is known that this  organisation in Johore is conducting active operations against the enemy.  Requests for more arms and equipment have been received and are being attended  to.     6 In October 1944 an attempt was made to contact the Malay community in  Kelantan but after landing from a Catalina the party was captured by the  Japanese. Wireless signals have been received from this party indicating  that it is signalling under Japanese duress. It is hoped that although the  original intention of the party has failed it may be possible to deceive the  Japanese by answering these signals in such a manner as may mislead the enemy  as to our intentions., TOP SECRET    3.0.2. OPERATIONS -SUMATRA  December 1941 -November 1944-.    HISTORICAL SUMMARYt    Sumatra to a large extent was and still is virgin territory  as regards 3.O.E. work. Only two minor operations have been carried  out during the period under review.    The first at the request of S.E.A.C. was launched in April  1944 and aaiiqples taken of the soil in various coastal areas.    The second in June 1944 was a coup-de-main exploit resulting  in the successful capture and exfiltration of a Malayan Police  Sergeant for Intelligence purposes. Information obtained indicates  that the Northern areas of the island are not suitable grourd for    future projects    AH operations into Sumatra and the Netherlands East Indies  generally are carried out in co-operation with the Dutch authorities.,     top mssm /   oimmuKs aus-pkalia   Oece iber 3.941 -Koveiaber X94 -   1 In April 1942 at the request of the O.-in-C.

This party has been the only link with the  outside world other than Japanese controlled lines. 1 aluable intelligence  has been trananitted and native contacts made should prove useful when  reoccupation of the area is undertaken.    b  Jaywick.  IMs operation carried out in surface craft resulted in the  destruction of and damage to 40 000 tons at shipping at Singapore in September  1943 his figure has been confirmed from eneny sources.      Ejisau   A similar operation to Jaywick on Singapore has recently been  undertaken. It is known that the party departed on the last stage by junk  according to plan and the submarine which was to pick them up at the advance  base reported evidence of the party s return. The submarine did not contact  the party and no further information is available.    d  British North Borneo.  A party led by British officers was infiltrated into the area in  September 1943 and withdrawn in June 1944. During this period a very extensive  intelligence organisation was built up and eneny shipping and air movements  reported on. These latter reports were extremely useful to both Colonial  office and G.H. 3.S.F.A. and were instrumental in several successful air  attacks on enemy fleet movements in toe area. This highly satisfactory operationis being followed up by a further project.    e  Other spheres &t operation are as follows  Java and Aru Islands -Penetration and eouwiunicationa established in 1942  later withdrawn.  Hew Guinea 8 parties introduced in 1942 later taken  over by 3.S.Q. S.W.P.A.  Dutch Hew Guinea 2 parties introduced.    The most valuable contribution made by these infiltrations has been the pro  vision of intelligence which has assisted in toe heavy sinkings of Japanese   shipping in the area.   Fartlea are able to observe and report in areas which are difficult  to cover by reconnaissance aircraft.   4. Future Operations.  There is obviously considerable scope for 3.0 .EyCoup-de-saain type  operations in this theatre. A large number of islands in enemy occupation  will be cut off from re-sft ply and with the rapid development in S.W.P.A.  forward bases raay soon be established from which fast surface craft and  native boats can operate. any of these operations are already planned and  only wait transport to carry them oat., TOP SECRET    /  S.O.E. OPERATIONS -MffiNCH WDQ-CllJm  Deceinber 1941 to November 1944.    She hlatosy of our activities in F.I.C. has so far been largely one of  negotiation and planning. However the results feo far obtained in shat is  the preliminary phase of operations confirm our opinion that in view of the  fact that the French forces in F.I.C. number 54 000 it will be possible to  organise an efficient and powerful resistance movement. The following is a  very brief outline of our activities.    In 1941 an organisation in Indo-China was being planned from Singapore  but when the latter place was overrun by the Japanese our work into F.I.C. was  suspended. Our activities now based on Indif. started again in earnest in the  Autumn of 1943 when it was decided to work closely with the Fighting French.    We were for a long time hampered by the fact that the principle of French  participation in the Far Eastern war was not recognised by the American Chiefs of  Staff due to the view at one time expressed by the President of the United States  that F.I.C. should not return to French control. Since the liberation of France  however matters have been easier and a French Military Mission headed by General  Blaizot hasbeenestablished atAdmiralMountbatten s headquarterswith the  approved of the Pidme Minister though not yet with the official recognition of  the President. It is now hoped to send elements of the French 5th Regiment  some 500 picked officers and men to India at once for future operations.  Negotiations axe being carried on for the basing of two French submarines in the  Pacific for sea-borne operations on the coast of F.I.C.    In spite of these protracted negolfetiona and delays the F.I.C. Section  staffed principally by French officers at our H . in India has drawn up detailed  plans for extensive action in F.I.C. These plans are based on the assumption  that the Japanese will eventually attempt to disarm the French and take over  complete control. They have been drawn up for execution in the following three  phases     a  Organisation of a Resistance Movement with & ti/T communication system  to India before any Japanese occupation   b  Harrassing action sabotage and demolitions aimed at the Japanese lines  of comiounication after Japanese occupation   c  Organised and sustained resistance by the French armed forces.  The essential minimum of phase a has now been completed and further  supply is continuing up to the maximum air lift obtainable. Phases b and o  will not be carried out until either the Japanese atterrpt to take control or    S.A.C.S.E.A. orders the resistance movement to begin offensive action. The  following results have so far been obtained   i 11 W/T sets have been delivered of which 7 a e in communication with  our India   11 The head of the S.O.E. F.I.C. Section in India a French officer was  dropped into F.I.C. where he discussed plans with the heads of the  Resistance Movement. He returned to China overland and from there to  India by air. Later on a successful landing operation he returned to  F.I.C. and the aircraft brought out three representatives of the  Resistance Movement to discuss plans with General Blaizot. As a result  of these discussions the Commander of the 5th Regiment accompanied these  three representatives back into F.I.C. carrying direct instructions  from General Blaizot about the detailed organisation of both the purely  military and the clandestine aspects of the resistance.     iii Organisers W/T operators and sabotage experts have been dropped  together with W/T equipment small arms and demolition stores.   iv W/T equipment has also been supplied to the French Intelligence Service  which provide§ iailitary intelligence to S.E.A.C. and General Chennault  Commander of the 14th American Air Force., . b&s trained & large nuroer of  agents for this Arm. nG elsa supplied  technical Information end stores.

It must be remembered throughout teat while plans and  strategy vermin fluid it Is impossible for S.O.E. to build  a plan that will fit the finished pietore.    2.  All that SOB can do In the present stage is to obtain  contacts and set up nuclei that can be expanded at fairly  short notice to fit in with the overall conception of  military plans. This is difficult. It is not aided by  ttie complexity of tike military set-up and the number of  authorities and theatres of war. The effect of all this  is to produce a picture add.eh Is likely to be too big for  Its frame. This Is inevitable but it must be remembered  that  the sum of the air effort Involved in feeding the     resistance potential in a number of different countries  and districts will always be greater than the actual amount  wanted at any one time. This is self-evident and due to  tike impossibility of mounting largs military operations  everywhere at once.  5.  Zf the above remarks are constantly borne in mind the  general reader should be enabled to secure some sort of  overall picture. For those more intimately concerned they  may serve to throw the whole subject into a sharper focus  free of the usual mass of fascinating but obscuring detail.  In any event it Is essential to remember that although  plans may be produced on paper by S.O.E. they cannot be  activated till they have been approved by P Division and  S.E.A.G. 8 Joint Planners. when approved and launched thep  plans and operations are S.E.A.C. responsibilities. This  clears S.O.E. of wanting both the moon and to run the war.  S.O.E. s function then is to produce ideas. It is a duty  to try and make them good ones.  HISTORICAL    4.  The story of the Japanese war is simply told. It is  the tale of a long planned and well executed aggression.  Though the preparations were there for all to see for some  ten years before the actual assault was launched the mental  attitude of the intended victims was such that they did not  seriously regard the impending threat. Alternatively when  the threat became real they were in no position -owing to  previous engagements -to apply the brake.  5.  The result of this has been written wide for all to  see. Defences were caught unprepared or were not strong  enough to cope with the surge south. The tide of war  swept up an easy teach. Hot only was there no sea wall  but the foreshore was lacking In those obstinate half tide  rocks which the Resistance in Europe has shown to be so  valuable. Their absence was due to a number of causes mostly  economic political and mental.  6.  For the well-to-do life in the East was easy and  pleasant. War was 'unthinkable . The warning voices  of those nearest to Japan advised to a deaf ear. Certainly  there was sometiling of a threat but it was remote and dis  tant. By all means make large donations to the war funds  and Increase the flow of exports valuable to the war effort  at home but to expect the last to organise for war and live  on .../, -2    on a real war footing was unthinkable In their turn  the aufchorltiea at home had their attention riveted to  the west and a life anddeath struggle on their doorstep.  Ihe pint pot was not big enough and in any event the  trickle of arms eastwards was the very last drags of the   barrel.    . This though was only the ease with that small part  of the population that looked to the west for guidance.  The local people -the inhabitants -had other views.  Or perhaps it would be safer to say that they had no views  at all. largely agricultural and illiterate they had  not reached a state of advancement and education in which  world politics played any important part. Those small  sections which did think at all were imbued wi th a small  and petty nationalism. As a result of this they were  prepared to try and change or alternatively had been suc  cessfully harried by the police as subversive and agitators.  The cases in which toe Government was really at one with  the people were few and the result has been that It has  proved difficult to set up any .underground or 'resistance  such as sprang up almost naturally in European countries.   SirSATIOM AT BSD OF 1942   The situation at the end of that year was that the  Japanese spring was nearly fully uncoiled. That this was  not complete was due to the slight brake Imposed by the  heroism and tenacity of toe small forces on toe spot.  Phase 1. had been a success for the Jap. He had extended  his power to the South and East so as to give him a very  strong position against any attack and positions from which  he hoped to complete toe conquest of toe Southern Regions - Australia Hew Zealand etc. -and of India.    a Right Flank  This flank had been almost completely cleared. He  held a chain of very strong natural positions from the nor  thermoat parts of Burma through a tangled and difficult  mountain region to the sea and a long and difficult coast  line from toe borders of India to to southern tip of  Sumatra. These positions could be lightly held. The  potential opposition was of the slightest and there was a  useful island outwork in the shape of the Andamans and  Hlhobars.   10.  It is true that his potential operations against India  in the summer of that year had failed for reasons possibly  to be found on the other flank. As an offset to this he  was to inflict a considerable reverse to our arms in toe  Arakan early in the next year.  11.  China had at last been completely isolated by land  and he was perhaps Justified in thinking that she would at  last fall like ripe fruit at his convenience. He had how  ever failed to reckon with either the assistance given by  toe Americans over the 'Hump or the moral tenacity of the  Generalissimo. If he could spare the forces Ms plans  for Phase 2 showed good prospects of success and he was  Justified in turning to his other flank.   b Left Plank  12.  On tola flank toe enemy had had some very striking  successes but had also had reverses on a scale larger than  those on his other flank. He had advanced over very much  greater distances and controlled a much greater total read  But he had corns up against s fleet that had revived with  amaslng speed and which had proved to Mm in tvo actions  that ... /, -S   that a measgra could bo act to Ms ambitions. In Sow  Guinea ho had coma up against tho tough Australian almost  on his own doorstop and boon shown that tho back door was  no way in for unwanted visitors.   IS. His Phaso 1 had boon an almost complete success but  to complete Phaso 2 -Australia Hogr Zealand and the remain  ing islands -he needed more air and sea power than he  could provide. In addition his communications were more  hazardous than on continental Asia. At this stage he  must have struck a balance and decided that Phase 2 in the  Pacific waa more important to him than Phaso 2 in India.  In this ho was probably misled by his reading of the internal  situation in India. It does seem possible that he thought  that another Congress Rebellion could bo laid on at his wish  and in any event the reverses suffered by Oermany in Egypt  and Russia had thrown out the programme for any joint plans  in the Middle East. Consequently his need to forestall  Germany had diminished.   Be that as it may the Jap turned to the Pacific and  there found that the cumulative effect of his losses ha  just tipped the scales against Mm. Biia must have been a  bitter pill but equally the compulsion of Allied effort  and considerations of strategy forced him to persevere on  the flank on which most remained to be done.   D.  SITUATION AT END OF 194  15.  Two years of war has shown that the Jap is a fanatical  and very tough enemy. It has also shown that he can be  beaten by the Allies in any and every field and on ground of  Ms own choosing. Phase 2 has completely aborted and  very serious inroads have been made into the ground won in  Phase X. He has however gained two years of valuable  time in which to organise himself in defence positions and  during which he has been able to loot the lands he has  overrun. The balance sheet though adverse has some credit  items.   a Right  Flank  16. On this flank he scored a success in the spring of  A  1943 wMeh must have encouraged him to undertake the more  ambitious programme of 1944. The attempt against Imphal  was vital to him. It was desired to cut off Assam and  so stop the evergrowing flow of supplies over the 'Hump .  This he had been unable to perform in any other way and was  a bold and skillful stroke which against only failed owing  to the tenacity of the troops on the spot   17.  When this plan failed he appears to have considered  trying for CMna direct. TMs stroke too appears to be  falling. In both tries he ha had Ms hand very near to  the prize he has tried to grasp.  13.  The resilt of these expensive failures is not yet clear  but it appears likely that he may have overreached himself  .  in Burma and so expended his force that he is compelled to  give much ground. It is possible that the blow may prove  vital to Mm and loosen Ms hold over the whole of the  South last Asia theatre.    b Left Flank  19.  On this side he has little or notMng to set on the  credit side of Ms account. IWo years have shown that he  was wise to consider it tbs more Important but have proved  that his precautions were inadequate. Islands have been  torn from Ms hold others have been by-passed. His air  power  ... /, -4   power has been severely handled and Ms fleet dealt a  series of mashing defeats.   20.  To-day only 800 alias of blue water and tenuous system  of land communications remain of his principle supply  artery to the Southern Regions. The cutting of this must  be vital to Mm. Zt Is not suggested that he will easily  let go of territories so Isolated. He can however very  111 afford Ms preamt policy of 'writing-off isolated  garrisons The problem of troops locked up In this manner  must be to him at best a headache aftd at worst a nightmare.  21.  Bis lack of adequate shipping has caused the almost  total breakdown of Ms 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' j led to  the failure to build up a sound economic structure and  aroused much hatred and mistrust by failing to implement  his promises of a satisfactory civil administration.  This lack of shipping must be stressed for this flank as  it Is even more vital than further west.  OUTLINE OF ECONOMICS   22.  It Is not proposed to delve very deeply Into the  economics of Asia as these can be etated fairly conclaely  in general outline. It Is certainly not intended to pro  duce a complicated mass of statistics. Any attempt at  such a review would be intolerably lengthy and quite out  side the proper purpose of this paper. It suffices to  say that the statements made in the following paragraphs  are ausceptlble of statistical proof which can be produced  if required. It is however vital to obtain some sort of  bird's eye view of the general economic structure of the  region and to attempt to understand some of the more common  terms in use by Japanese propaganda.  23.  In the first place there has been great talk of a  Go-Prosperity Sphere. TMs means to our view a closed  ring of countries from which only those products wanted  in Japan proper are exported and to which only those  manufactured articles surplus to Japan's own requirements  are imported. The idea of course is to make Japan  self-sufficient and to raise the standard of living in  Japan at the expense of the exploited areas. Considering  the resources which have fallen to her arms he has potentially  -succeeded very well. The Southern Regions  were to fill the same role for Japan as the agricultural  countries of Europe have played for Germany. go much is  quite clear. The weak point of volume of shipping  available was glossed over. In fact it has proved the  undoing of all these economic plans.  24.  The next term to definite is tee Inner Zone. This com  prises the Islands of Japan proper and those parts of the  mainland of North East Asia she has made her own. This  process of 'owing was one of gradual aggression and now  extends to Korea Manchuria and parts of North China.  These mainland areas are quite vital to Japan's economy  and have been ao organised that they are in effect highly  modern and industrialised parts of Japan herself. The  original inhabitants are in process of being absorbed or  completely dispossessed. This zone contains very nearly  aU the heavy industry of the whole area outside Japan and  is one of the main manufacturing centres for the whole  Japanese war and economic machines.  25.  The purpose of the overrun countries to the south and  east is to provide a constant stream of raw materials to  be manufactured in tee north. The labour for production  ie to be found within the countries themselves. As this  scheme is not dissimilar to what prevailed under the   regime ... /, 26.  27.  23.  29.  30.  reglm of the previous occupiers. It can be expected to be  fairly workable.    In fact the main differences are that raw materials  now flow -but in much smaller volume -to Japan instead  of to Europe and America. Instead of getting an ample  supply of manufactured goods in return the Japanese export  troops their equipment and very limited quantities of  such manufactures as can be spared. 5hls is a very pleasant  state of affairs for the enemy and he has had two years in  which to loot the countries which he has occupied. It  appears unlikely that he has had great and universal suc  cess in operating the production of the raw materials that  have fallen to him. But he undoubtedly has been able to  build up some stocks in Ms homeland.    Certain materials are vital to him -notably oil.  This he must have and in large quantities and secure supply.  It is unfortunate that all his conquered oil could be cut  off by a Junction from the PhiHipinss to China and it  nearly all lies in Borneo and Sumatra The amounts available  in his northern area are possibly adequate to sustain him in  a modern war -but only on much shorter lines of communication.  The remainder of his important strategic materials are largely  contained in hia Northern Zone. He should therefore have  been able to accumulate fair stock piles of such materials  as do not occur there. The main items in this class are  rubber tin wolfram chrome manganese bauxite etc. Like  Britain shipping is the difficulty but the percentage of  home produced food is greater or alternatively available  at fairly short distances.    It thus appears that the whole economic machine is in  fact an hour glass. Raw materials pour down through the  neck. Invert the glass and finished goods pour back again.  Cut the glass at the neck and eventually the upper glass  must run dry. How long this will be depends on how much  was in the upper glass when it was cut off A two year  occupation suggests that enough RAW PRIMARY PRODUCTS of the  south will have found their way north to make the running  dry a lengthy process.    The proceeding paragraphs have shown that tine continued  occupation of the southern regions Is vital to the Japanese.  The position can be erystalised by asking and answering two  questions. Stoat do these regions hold that is vital to  the Japanese The answer is oil rubber certain strategic  minerals and some food. On the other hand what does the  same area hold that is vital to the Allies The answer is  nothing. It ia true that we should be glad of the tin  rubber and wolfram and also certain of the foods that are  produced in such large quantities. But i i possible  for the United Rations to synthesise rubber and our other  sources of strategic minerals are limited but Just capable  of carrying the load. Prom this. It at once emerges that  it is not vital for us to get back into Malaya to get the    tin or Sumatra to get the oil. We are therefore in the  happy position of being able to dictate strategy to the  enemy now that the war has shown that we can beat him in  production and on the battlefield.    On the enemy a part it ia vital to him to ks ep open  the sea corridor and meanwhile to maintain and improve Ms  overland communications against a possible cut in the sea  route. It la likely that shortage of shipping and the  above necessity dictated his attack on Kweilin as much as  Ms wish to occupy the 14th U.S.A.A.F. airfields in that  part of the world. It has certainly enabled him to progress    with ... /    STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF SCQHOMICS ON STRATEGY, -6    with hia dreaja of & railway from Tokyo to Singapore.    Along  this route must pass as much raw material la and    war material out as ever he can posalnly manage. His    use of land communications has been energetic and he has  shown himself to be a clever builder of new railways.    Ee has used the sea as much as he has been able and the    drive  for wooden ships has shown the value he places on    the economy of water transport.    31.  All his efforts to keep his communications open and  working at high pressure will be to no avail if for any  reason there are no goods to carry. He must accordingly  uae his best endeavours to keep his 'slave labour working  in producing the constant flow needed to fill his commu  nications with traffic.  THE WEAR FOIEIB    32.  it is always sound to attack the enemy where he is  weakest. Three points of weakness have appeared. They a re   a Shipping   b Gommunications   e Labour.   a shipping  33.  Like England. Japan is an island and her shipping is  as vital to h-jr as ours is to us. Thfts shipping has  already been subjected to a prolonged and severe strain.  It is almost certain that It is a vanishing asset to him.  As however water is the best way of transport for h rge  cargoes he will be obliged to uae it to the end. Any  thing that can damage his shipping tonnage is accordingly  of prime importance.  34.  The submarine and the bomber are perhaps our most  valuable weapons against his ships. It must be remembered  that snips have to dock and have to be repaired. The  bomber can do something against ports and dockyards but  so can S.0.E./Ship sabotage is a very effective weapon.   b Communications  35.  . Supposing that the sea line to Japan can be cut. then  all the traffic must go by land at least part of the way.  Anything that can damage Ms communications is therefore of  value. The bomber is an excellent weapon for this and  has been employed with great success against him. Its uae  should be continued.  36.  It must be remembered that in the very backward and  undeveloped country of South East Asia the communications  are thin long and at best tenuous. The distances are  great and the areas served vast. Topography forces great  deviations on even the main routes and these are few. Over  large areas the population density is low. These long  lonely lines of communication are both vital and highly  vulnerable to S.O.R.'s type of activltjr.   c Labour  37.  It is luckily possible to generalise about labour.  There Is no doubt that it was much better off before the  Jap came. The pay is not so good. If It la higher then  an inflationary spiral has started and less can be bought  for the same money. In many places goods are not avai  lable even on the bJa ck market  38. These are conditions that h hour nowhere envoys.

Owing to the economic causes mentioned above all  k  the workers would welcome an increase in wages.

It is not very'dangerous and is ideally  suited to the mentality of many potential native agents.  3. THE PEOPLES 1H RELATIQH TO TilBIR PRESENT OVERLORDS  42. Through South East Asia the peoples are all of the  same basic stock. They are all Mongoloid. The dividing  line between the Aryans of India anfl the Mongoloid Burmese  is a sharp one. The appearance of the people is very  similar and varies only slightly among Burmese Karens  Shans Siamese Malays Javanese and even Chinese. To  the average Englishman  and he would experience  they would all be Chinese looking'  some difficulty in telling them  apart. Owing to this similarity and its complete  variation from the Aryan type it is impossible for a  European to escape notice. Hot only does he stand well  above the surrounding crowd but Ms colouring and build  mark him out as something different. The only exception  to this ia Frencji Indo-China. There owing to the present  state of semi-occupation and the past colonial policy of  the French there ia nothing odd or unusual about the  stray European.  43. This state of affairs at once bars the uae of European  agents unless they can be sure of a safe harbour from  Japanese eyes. Even then they are the subject of general  gossip and so security Is at once lessened. It is there  fore essential to examine the general racial characteristics  of the peoples living In the area with a view to assessing  their importance character and political tendencies in  relations to possible S.O.E. activities.  44. ... /, -6   44. To start with a sharp distinction mast be mde between  the peoples of the plains and those of the hills By the  standards of the hiIlmen the plainsman is soft Life in  the hills is arduous and often very primitive indeed  ltds is a result of past racial movements. It is thought  that the peoples of South East Asia all started from the  Central Aslan Plateau and moved southwards in waves well  spaced In time. Uxe result has been that when a wave got  up enough strength it swept down Into the valleys and  settled in the fertile lowlands. Hie previous occupiers  were killed or driven off Into the hills. The result of  this process has been to produce a backward but sturdy set  of tribes in the hills and a more highly organised and  effete population in the plains.  45 By European standards the plainsman is backward and  in general terms some 80% of the total population is  engaged in agriculture. This moans that predominantly  the countries are inhabited by peasant farmers. The  remaining 20 comprises all other activities -shopkeepers  merchants officials. Industrial labour and the large  amount of cooly labour essential to the life of the largest  towns and cities. Owing to the very backward state of the  education the first glimmerings of political consciousness  have only reached a part of the town population. The  villagers could be made to believe almost anything provided  it was aaid loud enough and repeated often enough.    46.  It is the young 'intelligensla' of the towns that  are important for political warfare end economic sabotage.  The tough hill tribes can be expected to provide the beat  guerillas.  47.  The soft climate and the very great fertility of the  soil have combined to mould the character of the various  races in the area along similar lines. As famine is a rare   vent and enough can be obtained to cat by a very small  degree of exertion toe inhabitants would all be considered  lazy by western standards. Their wants are simple and few  and can be easily met. This is a predominant feature  almost throughout the area. Arising out of this and the  ease with which rice can be grown. Is a love for colour  entertainment and minor luxuries. On the other hand it  must be remembered that they have only recently begun to  emerge from the middle ages. Tempers are quick and life  la not held at the same value as In the west. Murders  and Crimea of violence are common. Balanced between  these two extremes lies toe inevitable oriental belief  in graft and the innate hospitality and friendliness of  all primitive peoples.  4S. Iheae remarks are not complete however without some  mention of the Chinese. Biis very Important race has  reached a very high standard of culture and civilisation.  In their own land the bulk of the people is backward and  engaged in agriculture. Owing to the very great anti  quity of the civilisation the pressure on the land is  very great and there is not the same comparative ease and  plenty which prevails In the more southern lands. This  has driven a very large number to emigrate.       49.  The Chinese outside Ms homeland is generally a cut  above the local Inhabitant. He is found in business  both large and small. He Is a shopkeeper a moneylender  a garage owner a brothel keeper or a Mgher grad clerk.  He abounds In the towns and generally prospers owing to  greater education ability and hard work. He forms an  important element In the population and is generally far  more politically conscious than the local people. He  hangs together with his own kind and although subject  to .../, to th dofocts of character coniBion to all orientals he  generally loathes the Japanese.    50.  The tendency of this peculiar mixture was generally  isolationist and narrowly nationalist. Only In the Dutch  Islands was the political situation relatively quiet  and stable as a whole the people had been told that  a change was wanted and were prepared to believe the  Japanese promises for that change. More than two years  of occupation have shown that this view was wrong and that  they are worse off than they were. There are some clear  signs that they now desire to be rid of the Jap but it  must once again be stressed that the numbers that can be  expected to help at this stage are small. It is a common  failing to want to back a vinner' at no cost.    I. FLAMS a P TOPOOfiAHY  This is a matter for the military planners on the  very highest level. It is however intended to record  a few inescapable facts as seen from the viewpoint of    s.o.s.  In the first place distances arc vast. A very  largo part.of the area is completely out of range of  even the largest shore based aircraft. It is therefore  vital that the phasing of the attacks bs Indicated in  general outline before S.O.B. can hope to prepare any  sort of planning schedule. An advance to Mandalay would  bring the whole of F.I.C. Siam and Burma within range.  Rangoon would extend this to nearly all Malaya ana North  SsMltra. LasMo would extend the range eastwards to the  southern seaboard of China. Should a southern path be  taken a lodgement in Korth Sumatra would cover Siam  Malaya Sumatra and South Indo-China.    It is therefore vital to have advance information  as to what the phasing of plana may be both as to lae  and time. Ihls is essential if there Is to be even the  minimum of a prepared groxmdwork. It Ia no good building  u for a potential D-Day for South Burma if the attack  is aftsr all to fall on Horth Sumatra.    Aopography and spheres of influence are closely allied.  The boundaries between 5.S.A.C and 3.W .A have not been  clearly defined. Nothing Is known as to how the olans for    the two commands are to be co-ordinated. China appears  to be a closed sphere of American interest. Is this to  be combined with the American thrust across the Pacifief    Whatever the answers to these important questions  may be the salient facts of topography are inescapable.  The country as a whole is mountainous rugged and undeveloped.  The coamsunies felons are poor and almost all run North -South.  East-West communications are rare difficult and even more  tenuous than the main lines. Ihia much is forced on us  and it has been shown that the Communications are vulnerable.  The question to be answered is where and when does 3.0.'.strike.    J. 0. ' . . ACTIVTfiKS mV IRIFMHQMS  56.  This is not the place to survey every operation or  projected operation in detail. Those Interested can obtain  such detail from the concerned files. It is however  possible by a study of the brief outlines of all operations  et present on the books to produce a numerical table.  ThJ.s table brings out the present emphasis and allows the  potentiallties to b studied in a general way., 10   57. a first attempt at this on the basis 'one for one  did not present a fair picture as obviously some opera  tions have a greater potential value than others. The  table below is a second attempt and is weighted. It  shows all operations classed as    Active  Suspended or So Sews  Planned or  Completed.    It is then necessary to study only the first three of these  four classes. Bach operation has been given a value which  assesses the potentialities of that operation and so allows  them to be grouped into three classes    Large or potentially very valuable.  Medium or valuable and  Small or operations of limited value.    These three classes have been given 'marks in the ratio    36 24 12. The marks have been divided proportionately  according to the objects of the operation. This system  is somewhat complicated but presents a fairer picture than   one drawn from the unweighted summary.    58.

This summary la interesting. It brings out the impor  tance of Surma in the present set of operations and stage of  the war. It brings out the attention that is being paid to  -laying down a ground rk in Siam and fostering resistance in    F.I.C. The effort being expended on the penetration of  Malaya la perhaps rather over emphasised but it Is certain  that the work being done la on the right lines. It la  clear however that the attention is still largely concentrated  on Burma. That this country is the only one that has been  thoroughly penetrated in the field Is due to Its geographical  position and the stage at present reached In the military  operations.  60. Considering the emphasis that has been laid on the  Jf.E.I. in planning by the Joint Planners it is Interesting  to notice the small numbers of projected or active opera  tions which appear in the table. The trouble there    appears ... /, 11    appears to ba on that S.O.F.. cannot correct and is  believed to be on a high political level with the Dutch.   61.  For the rest the contacts in Slam promise well and  it would appear important to press on with the organisation  of this country. In F.I.C. good communications exist  with the local French and very good prospects are held out  for profitable operations. In Malaya matters are still  in an early stage but the contacts with the Chinese &.J.T7.  appear well established and should be of considerable  ultimate profit. In China the present operations are  on a small scale and not very active. The Intentions in  that country are much more ambitious and the summary tends  to undervalue them.  62.  At present therefore the investments that are likely  to show an immediate dividend are limited to Burma and  F.I.C. Elsewhere there is considerable nursing to be  done. While it is essential to keep a number of irons in  the fire it is equally important to prevent their becoming  too hot too soon. This can only be done by obtaining a  clear understanding of the overall strategic plans and  timetable.   DBPENDKHCE QP FORCE 156 as AIR LIFT   63.  Examination shows that out of the total of 65 operations  listed no less than 43 depend on air supply. This total  would be higher but for the large areas in Malaya S.E.I.  and China that are out of present aircraft range. There  seems to be no doubt that overland contacts are too slow and  that the submarine is an inferior vehicle in several respecta  As the front moves forward and new areas come  within range ao will the proportion of air mounted opera  tions increase.  64.  At present the air potential in S.l.A.C. is small.  The distances are very great and for very long sorties only  a part of the moon period can be used. Over at least six  months of the year the weather is very uncertain and the  number of abortive and cancelled sorties can be expected  to be high. Navigation at night is difficult and the  radio facilities ere scanty. With the present number of  0  aircraft it would be foolish to aim for much more than 50  successful sorties a month. Up to the present the  number attempted has not risen to this figure.   65.  Because of this small potential air lift it la a  duty to make the machine aa efficient as possible. Every  operation must be examined to see that It may not turn out  to be a wild goose chase. This must be done in the early  planning stage. The machinery for this exists. P Divi  sion and ACSEA examine and approve each and every air opera  tion. S.O.E. is responsible that the idea is not an enthu  siastic misconception 'sold by personality on the basis of  the buyer presuming the seller's information to be absolutely  accurate. Those operations which look promising at the  start and then go sour are an Inevitable risk in this type  of work. This should be covered if it is clearly under  stood that demands for air operations are on a maximum  basis for fully Implementing any plan. In certain cases  this maximum will never be reached. As no human can  possibly hope tq be entirely infallible In estimating the  course of the war there are always a number of unknown  factors in planning. Ihe China Pipeline or bases in the  Philliplnes may quite alter the present planning Ideas  for South China. If this is so then a large air potential  may be freed. The situation must be regarded as fluid.  It is essential to remember that all theatres are unlikely  to be active at the same time. It Is important though to  make as sure as possible that there are reasonable grounds  for ... /, 66.  67.  68.  69.  70.  12   for hope before embarking on a large air programme and  vital to attempt to provide an air balance sheet workable  within the limits of human forethought    Enough has been said about the difficulties of handling  air lift. the fact remains that it la essential. The  area Is so large and the communications so poor that over  most of South East Asia aircraft are the only means of  supply and transport. Owing to the rugged nature of the  terrain weather and navigation hasards are more to be  feared than the enemy. With good crews ths loss rate  should be very low.    COSCLUSIOMS    It now remains to be considered what plans can be under  taken with profit and what priority should be put on the  various current operations. This is difficult to do without  the present conception of Allied strategical planning as a  basis. Some sort of timetable is also required. There is  no doubt that progressively greater forces will be made available  to S.E.A. and it would be convenient to have some sort of idea  as to when these are likely to be forthcoming. The present  conception seems to be to re-open land communications with  China through North Burma and then clear South Burma. This  brings Siam closely into the picture. The alternative is to  assault Sumatra. This opens up Malaya On the other side  it is possible that the Philliplnes may prove a stepping  stone to F.I.C. or South China. It is essential therefore  to maintain and intensify operations in these countries.    The study of economics aid the foregoing paragraphs  have shown that oommunlcations and labour are vital and  vulnerable. It is also known that the main traffic artery  runs along the seaboard of F.I.C. It would therefore appear  to be sound to mount operations against oommunlcations and  labour in that area. Any other main communications or labour  forces should only be considered in relation to current  military operations. For this a good groundwork is essential.    At present this policy is being followed. The Special  Operational Groups in Burma are aimed at communications The  contacts with the Tbakln movement can be used against labour.  The Polka series of sorties issupplying arms in the right  quarters In F.I.C. Plans for the B.B.I. are somewhat dabulous  but it is in China that a plan is most urgently needed. One  has been advanced but involves a very heavy air lift. The  remainder of the programme is possibly within the capabili  ties of the available aircraft.    Severtheless nearly all the current plans are funda  mentally tactical ideas linked to the possible short term  strategy of the armed forces. There seems to be no doubt  that Japan will fight to a finish. Her isolated southern  garrisons will be left to their fate. They can be liqui  dated at leisure whatever their strength or tenacity and    3.O.E. can help the process materially. It is. however  clear that an allover long term strategic plan is needed.  It is the enemy in Japan and the Inner Zone that has to be  beaten before the war can be ended. Already there are  certain intentions and contacts in that direction but.  speaking generally operations in North China Manchuria  and Korea are still in the future. These areas are distant  and very difficult of access. They are also vital highly  industrialised and vulnerable. In the long view the  strategical targets lie in the North East.  oOo, COPY    TAG HQ/1.  Brig. J. Anstey  Rangoon  Force 136 HQ Kandy.    Dear  Brigadier    The story of Seagrim has made a considerable impression down  here and last night I was' approached by Ian Morrison the Times'  correspondent who wanted some assistance in an article he was  writing about Seagrim. In the course of conversation I discovered  that his article had already run to over 100 pages und he  himself admitted that it was becoming a book.    .   He is a first class fellow young modest and I should say  intellectual in fact just the type of man who should write the    story of Seagrim. He said incidentally that if it did materialise  he proposed to devote the proceeds to the Karens.    \   I encouraged the idea and although pointing out that I must refer    the matter higher I said I thought Force 136 would also welcome    it provided     a  The security angle was taken care of.   b  The idea was acceptable to the relatives of the officers   which I think it will be with Morrison as author .  He is-still busy on the first draft and is picking up all the  threads available here -which are ore than I would have expected.  He is writing the Times however for leave of absence for three  months about Dec. 1945/Feb 1946 so that he may go over the  ground in Karenni get the local colour and finalise the book.    He -and others who should know -consider the book will be a best  seller. I am inclined to agree with them and since 1 believe  firmly that some one will write Seagrim's story some day I am all  in favour of it being done soon and by so suitable an author.  Will you please confim that we may continue to encourage and assist  him to the best of our ability. I will accept the responsibility    of seeing that he does not go off the rails.    ...

I am British by birth  and served m the India Army during the last war. as well  as through three frontier campaigns in 1919 and 1920.    On June 22 this year I was flown in a Lysander to the  Karenni Hills of Eastern Burma where until June 25 I  witness and participated in the work of the HYENA Group    of Operation CHARACTER' . The trip was arranged by GHQ  New Delhi Calcutta and Rangoon in co-operation with  Force 136 hdqrs Rangoon.    The purpose of the undertaking was to provide material  for a lecture tour in the United States as a means of   selling the British-Indian contribution to the Far  Eastern conflict  a particularly difficult task at  this stage because of the spectacular achievements of  the Americans in the Central Pacific and the prospective    U.S. landings on Japan proper or the East China coast.  Returning to Rangoon from HYENA I discussed the subject    of a book on the Burma phase of force 136 with Col.    Gardiner and he in turn gave me a look at the files of    the organization. From this I concluded that a book    could be written which would enjoy a very wide acceptance    among American readers and would unquestionably do much  to oublicize the Burma story and the British-Indian  effort in the Far East.    In Calcutta I went over the project further with Mr. Gavin    Stewart as well as with Brig. Desmond Young the DPR    In New Delhi and both men seemed to agree that the    idea of a book was sound strategy from a public    relations standpoint. Prior to leaving the U.S. I had    contacted a publisher friend of mine and from our talk    am convinced that the proposed undertaking will obtain, 2 .  his enthusiastic support and backing. There should be    a minimum sale of 50 000 copies with a mugh higher   circulation entirely possible considering the subject  matter.    If you and your associates approve the project I shall    be glad to undertake the writing of the book providing    I am given adequate colaboration by the provision of full    factual details --or at least as much as it is now deemed    safe to divulge. To exploit timeliness fully the  manuscript should be prepared immediately to have it ready  for the presses as soon as secur-ity restrictions have    been lilted. We would thus benefit by public interest    at its height when the first details.of this behind the    enemy lines' operation are broken in the newspapers.  Sgd. Michael Fielding.

Of the Europeans put into Malaya in January 1942 to function  as left-behind parties seven reached Sumatra but so far as is known  have not escaped from that island. Thirty three are unaccounted for  and are presumed to be in Malaya either at large or prisoners in  enemy hands if indeed they have survived. Thus there are forty to  be regarded as missing . Prior to their entry into Mdaya these men  with one exception were given commissions Malaya Command there  were ten First Lieutenants and twenty nine Second Lieutenants. The  exception was Sartin a R.E. sergeant who for the purposes of this  operation was to be treated so far as pay is concerned as a Second  Lieutenant for the three months while hewas working for us.  2. These men were guaranteed three months' pay from the date of  appointment and pay was to be on the basis of army rates for the  respective ranks mentioned. It was arranged with them that they were  if possible to remain in Malaya for three months and then to endeav  our to escape and report. Should nothing be heard of any one of them  at the end of his three months it was understood that he would be pos  ted as missing following which his case would receive the same treat  ment as that for a missing man Of his rank.    3. On engagement each man was given an advance of pay the amount  of the advance varying with individual requirements and the balances  of the guaranteed three months' pay are owing. The men were appoint  ed by 0.105 now B/B.I85 who promised that outstanding balances of  the three months' pay would be paid into personal bank accounts of the  men concerned into their wives' or next of kin's accounts or held in  trust pending being later claimed by the beneficiary. Particulars  are on record of what was arranged in each case.  4. The sum total of the outstanding balances of the three months'  pay of these forty men amounts to 503 10.0. India will deal with  the cases of fourteen of the men who left addresses in or whose next  of kin are in South Africa Australia or New Zealand. The amount  India will require to expend will be 135 0.6. which will presumably  be drawn from funds remitted from London to our India organisation.  The remaining twenty six cases are for handling in London as present  residences of wives relations and former employers are in the U.K.  or thought to be there. The total due to these twenty six is 368.  9.6 &0 far as I know no provision for these payments has been made  in ijB budget.  5. The first step to be taken is to try to inform next of kin of  the fact of the casualty and to endeavour to obtain the address of the  bank account in the U.K. of the men concerned or of the relatives to  whom payment is to be made. Possibly these will be cases of wives or  near dependent relatives applying for balances which applications will  require consideration and treatment on their merits. All the men  were engaged in the M.E.W.-F.E.M. offices at Singapore and their  commissions were arranged at die Mission's request. Therefore they  will have regarded themselves as associated with the Mission and its  activities and may have informed relatives of that association. This  must be borne in mind when prosecuting enquiries as to next of kin  bank/, -2   bank accounts and so on. It is suggested that 0.102 proceed with   the tracing of these matters  with a view to payment of the outstand   ing balances being made. Appropriate security arrangements would  first be agreed upon.   6. On a date three months after date of appointment these forty  men are officially missing . Does this organisation make such  payments as are due to wives or next of kin as are sanctioned Or  can it be assumed that the War Office will make such payments as are  granted in respect of the missing men provided they are given the  necessary information If the latter is the case a list giving  full details will be forwarded through the usual channels.  7 The following will be dealt with by India.

I doubt/whether the scheme as it stands is really a workable  proposition. It seems to depend on linking up individual Europeans with  Asiatic bands but I very much doubt whether in the clrcurostances  envisaged the Europeans would be ab e to move about freely in occupied  territory.  Other objections I see to the scheme ero    a  It ia a further coll on our already dwindling European  man-powar resources.    b The suggestion to Asiatics that there is any chance of the  enemy entering the country may have serious psychological effects.    3. what I think might be useful would be the building up of an  organization to remain in the event of invasion in occupied territory  with the role of reporting enemy activities Eioveaents locations of  headquarters dumps etc. If portable or other wireless sets could be  made available for this organisation so iwch the better Possibly an  organization of this sort could be built up based on the Police Forces  without having to tell the Asiatics beforehand what it as intended for  4. The Army is naturally very much concerned in plans of this sort  and I would ask that this Headquarters may be kept fully informed if it is  intended to proceed on the lines suggested   3gd A.I.

MQoT    Momoranduia on the uses of Guerilla Parties in the event of hostile    advances in certain frontier areas in Malaya    1 The organisation as nov. proposed falls into two groupst &  Intelligence Task -to report enemy movements  dispositions etc   b Qoorational. Task -to harass the enemy by guerilla  attacks on his rearward organisation    2 It is doubtful bother these two groups can be combined.  The object of the Intelligence group must be to see and report  without being seen or reported. The Operational group must if  it is to achieve any success make itself of such nuisance value as  to force the enemy to take counter measures. The tactics of the  two groups must therefore be basically different ad two separate  organisations are indicated    S Intelligence Groups.     a  The aim ill be to provide local military commanders .ith  oarly and accurate information of the enemy.,  b  As the means of re orting will eveatualiy be by wireless   local military commanuers'5 will be those whose H.Q. s  contain S/T facilities capable of pieMiing up these Reports.  These will be normally the forward Brigade H QT 3 Furhher  examination is required as to whether existing arj y sets  will be able to pick up reports by the portable set which  Is proposed for the reporters Another point for exam  ination is whether as messages from report will probably  be at irregular and hours special listening sets will be  required to watch for their reports.   c  The following is the type of information which would be  useful from the military point of view 1.  Location strength and. identification of enemy units.  8.  Equipment and morale ofenemy.  b.  Locations of Amn. petrol and other dumps and of H.Q.  4  Information regarding the improvement to road and rail  communications    5  Details of thyuse of aerodromes number of planes etc.    6  Information regarding a.F.Ys and thepossible use of gas.    7  Relations between enemy and Inhabitants of occupied  territory     Q P. imtioaalJHOna3     a  The aim should be so to threaten and If possible to  disorganise enemy communications as to force him to take  counter measures., &     b TheaQ counter measure will it is hoped take the form  of provision of guards on comsaunications H Qs and  installations and the uotaohiaents of troops to round  up the guerillas. If thi dispersion of the enamy  troops can be brought about the operational group will  have served its purpose. It must however be accepted  that the uneasy counter measures may take another form  large scale execution of the civil population in the  areas of guerilla activity.   c It seems unlikely that the operational groups and  particularly the European leaders 111 be able to  remain active for more than a limited period It  follows that they should aim at quick results   d The chances of maintaining touch with operational  groups appear to be slight. They must therefore be  prepared to work on their on initiative. For this  pur use they should have from the outset a directive  to guide their efforts and to ensure that those are  in accordance with military plans   e The activities of operational groups should also  conform to the policy regarding denial and destruction  which has been agreed with H E The Governor and G Q C  Malaya anti notified to civil officials and military  commanders. Secretary for Defence Mo.5 in 3 for  D.6o/41 of 21/6/4.1 auc H.Q Malaya Command Mo 38L-27/G  of 2S/S/41 refer .   f The ta&ks of operational groups might include the  demolition of the smaller ro- .d anti rail bridges but  should MOT include the demolition of tunnels or the  larger road and rail bridges unless specially ordered.  If those are to be destroyed during the process of with  drawal the Army should be responsible. Destruction  after withdrawal might not accord with military plans   g It follows that objectives of operational groups would  be generally as foliovs - The smaller road and rail briug.es.  Dumps of supplies petrol ammunition and stores of all  natures  M.T vehicle parks ana individual M.T vehicles.  Telephone and telegraph lines in enemy use.  Port and landing facilities handing craft.  Railway rolling stock  Materials for bridge and road repair road machinery  sawn timber saw mills ferries.  Hostile headquarters isalatad officers find sentries  de..-patch riders.  5. The general conclusion from the above survey is that   /harass intelligence groups capable of transsitting reports could  be usefully left in any territory occupied by the enemy operational  groups would be most effective and at the same time least likely  to interfere with military operations in the frontier areas through  which the main channels of communication run. It is therefor  thought that the organisation should be developed in the following  areas    Intelligence groups -HibaMTAM XftEMOGAJiU PAHAHG KA iT  JOHORS KEDAH PIRuId -PROVINCE  t'EDLSSLSSr    Operational groups -K.EANTM -3A T JOHORE -KEDAH PEKLI3., Copy of fetter from G E Mott    to  Lt.General Percival   Mofejaber 20tfc I94i  w    . i\ /.

It ms thought that locally in MALAYA such an organisation should  have British leaders who would retiain behind the nnesiy lines in general  concealed and solectfsd Asiatic operatives who could rajve about without fear  of detection. It was never thought possible in the early stages that large  bodies of guerilla troops could be organised wing to the difficulty of  living on the country in MALA . -which consists aainly of plantations or  jungle. In this we un&exvestimated the potentialities of the Chinese    Accordingly 0 i . put forward in broad terns pi'opoaals to build up  an organization which depended on selecting certain Britieh I'esidenta in  MALA who before the war would be principal organisers and after the war  the controllers of activities In their areas. Those aon would be trained ia  8 0 methods and would be given stores and W/P equipment in miple tir se to  have all preparations ready if and when war broice out.    Those proposals were disoussed at 0 M s periodical Heelings with    the C in 0 Far Lost and the 0 in C China at dS Q 3IK3A 0KS and at those    wjetiags they were approved in principle. For reasons of security the    details were not discussed on a lower plane than G.K c at that stage.    It then became necessary to appoint an officer to plan and control    this proposed organisation s selects Mr T C.

H 2. the Governor was norvoue of the effect of the scheme on  Asiatic jasrale because it inplled that vjq conteaplated the a jy would be  able to occupy HAIAYA at least in part.

It became clear that these difficulties would require time and  patience to resolve. In September 1941 0.107 was put in charge of the  Malayan organisation to handle negotiations with the powers leaving  Lt.Ool. Hinde to control the selection of suitable personnel up-country.    Meetings with the Governor the G.O.C. and the I.G.P. and 0 M  continued but without progress. On September 30th the matter was put  up to the 0 in C and he ruled that nothing further should be done by 0 M.  He later agreed however to re-opening discussions and throughout  October meetings continued though without solution. Following a meeting  held on Oct. 23rd counter-proposals were put up on Nov.11th by the G.O.C.  to 0 M as a guide to the way in which the G.O.C. wished operations to be  organised. These in general were similar to 0 U proposals three months  earlier but laid greater emphasis on the use of the organisation for  obtaining intelligence and limited the proposed operational groups to the  frontier areas only. Subsequently on Nov 22nd the G.O.C. demanded  that the organisation should come under Military control.    At this stage the negotiations with the G.O.C. were adjourned  until the return of 0.100 who was absent from Singapore and Lt. Col.  Hinde again proceeded up-country though he was to recruit now only for  an intelligence organisation. By that tine moreover the Far East War  was imminent and nothing further could be done to get an operational  organisation moving before war broke out.    The principal letters exchanged during the above period are    attached.    AFTER TOE OUTBREAK OF AR.    SI   Shortly after the Japanese attack on MALAYA when the nature    of the warfare became evident Lt. Col. Warren and Major Chapman were    attached to 3rd Ind. Corps H.q. at KUALA LUHHJR expressly to organise    and command reconnaissance and raiding parties behind the enemy lines.    This included combined naval operations to land raiding parties from the    coast, -4-   Largely as a result of a successful and most revealing     m  reconnaissance conducted in the PERAK RIVER area by Major Chapman  from 24th to 28th December it became obvious to Advanced Command that  there were great opportunities for parties to operate behind the enemy  lines particularly against communications. It was evident that the men  would not be able to cover long distances and that they would have to be  equipped to exist independently for long periods.    Major Chapman then volunteered to remain behind the advancing  enemy lines with a selected party. His plan was approved by 3rd Ind.  Corps Command. O. . proposals to follow up with other parties were  discussed in SINGAPORE with the G.O.C. Malaya who now gave his un  qualified recommendation that 0 M. should proceed with these plans.    It was naturally immensely more difficult and less satis  factory to improvise at this stage vfinat O.M. had hoped to do in an orderly  xoanner beforehand . There were however limited possibilities and  these were pursued with all possible energy.    i   Two groups of left behind parties were organised namely  European and Chinese Communist which were entirely separate in  conception.    HJROrEAIT LEFT BEEIIKD PARTIES.    Early in the Malayan campaign when KEDAH and PEMANO had  already been lost it became evident that there was a considerable flow  southward of dispossessed British personnel whose principal qualifications  were those of knowing the country and the language. Many of these men    with  were eager above all else to get back into country of the type/which they  were familiar in order to harass the Japanese in small units. These  men were chiefly planters miners and Government field servants including  Agricultural Irrigation Survey and Forestry officers. They were  accustomed to and not afraid of living in the Jungle and moving in  Jungle country. The younger men with these qualifications were in  general in the various volunteer services which were being held in reserve  and which had up till then been given little work., , &    to Preparation of all store including food  o Transport of mn and stores up to the line.  Q M SBKS&itag co-ordinntod and controlled all these  activities and in additionia  Picked up a number of recruits in S1M3APCKE mainly from  volunteer units in reserve.  to Handled all adrlnistration problems concerning the men    l.e. ecmiseioning pay to dependents and the formalities  necessary to get the men released from their Volunteer or  Civilian duties.  RKCHUITINCr m'O TRAININS    The factor sfhich ultimately limited the number of men who  could toe put on the ground was the capacity of No.101 3.T.S. Owing to  the large number of Chinese simultaneously in training so below only  S Europeans could toe trained adequately at the sane time In the early        stages however before the scheme began to work smoothly it was    difficult to find that number of suitable Europeans weekly.    By the tino the fitting reached JQHORE other organisations  were competing for personnels in particular Lt. Col Dall was  collecting men of local experience for intelligence reconnaissance parties  but thanks to close co-operation between him and Lt. Col barren there  was no difficulty in allocating men to the most suitable posts    hvory effort was made by No.101 s T.3. to give these groups    of men a general training in weapons explosives iacendlaxy and daisy    devices owing to the extreme need for speed in getting on to the    ground this training had to be curtailed to a few days only in some    cases. It was not necessary that every man in each party should be    trained at the school and where time pressed the numbers were made up    with men having the necessary qualifications but untrained.    TEHK3 OF ssavicg 01 MM    All men relected for these parties were comissioned as from    the date they went in being given the rank of 2nd. Lieut. VASJSk Comand    and entitled to pension rights accordingly. The leaders of each party    wore commissioned as 1st. Lis. 0 M ere responsible for all payments, into those aen s bank accounts or into their dependants accounts  where these nan nust be conaider 4 visaing and all the essential  records bav been eafely brought out of 322 0/tP01i   STCIL.3 J-   The oarliest parties were fitted out with rations obtained  in rlJAlA UMrUR and with dwtolition stores and anas issued froa the  school Iraeiediately afterwards all stores were organised on to a  standard bas s each party on leaving the school at the end of training  being equipped to operate for 3 Months independently of any outside  support The equipment is given in Appendix 1 attached.   IQGATIOB r LiOT BliEIIlD PMTIES   Fran the reports received from behind the enemy lines it was  evident that the Japanese were holding their lines of conmnlention very  lightly. Moreover until the occupation of I5ERSEW at the end of the  campaign they were dependent on the long line down the vest side of the  peninsula for their min supply route. Eneray communications were  therefore the principal targets of the left behind parties.   The sites chosen for their hideouts were wherever  possible places where there were bottlenecks in communications with  good Jungle cover nearby. Alternatively sites were chosen where two  or more main roads could be menaced fro one oamp.   Time did not permit the use of outside labour to  establish the main camps if these were to be pushed up as oar the  enemy lines as possible. The parties and their stores were tuken to  the limit which road transport could reach and the clumps taken a quarter  of a mile or so into Jungle cover. It was then up to the party to  establish their own camp which might for safety be some miles off the  road and to porter their kit to this camp preferably leaving part of  their reserves elsewhere in case of discovery This was expected to  take each party a week or so and no effective sabotage operations were  hoped for within 10 to 14 days of each party going in., 8    RECORD OF IKDIVIiJUAL i-ARTIES    The first three parties which war organised froxa KUALA  IDMI-Wl under the general leadership of Major F.S.

They went in about 8th January.  The area of operation of this party was about Frasers Hill west  wards of the min road and railway running south from TANJQNS HALIM  Unfortunately two mishaps occurred to this partyi     a  -Major Chapman failed to keep a rendezvous with them to accompany  them to their hideout. It is not known what happened as ho was  not seen again.   b  -They lost moat of their stores including their w/T set. Apparently  the party went ahead of the coolies which they had engaged to carry  loads part of the way up into the jungle and the coolies finding  food in some of the loads made off with the lot.  Without food the party was unable to function and had to find  their way out. VAN HEKEK ORANSKI and EOIBRY reached the SELANGOR coast  in about a fortnight and got out to SUMATRA and later to SINOAPOHB. On  the strength of their report an expedition under Lt.Col.

A member of the Communist party was attached to the party for  Intelligence purposes., -11 -   This party was to operate from the North Eastern corner of SOCFIN  Estate -about 9 miles to the South East of LABIS. It was indicated to the  Leader of the party that he should find targets on the railway to the East on  the main road to the East running south from LABIS and also in the Estate itself.  The Estate has many roads and provides excellent cover for m/t and troops from  the air. It would doubtless have been used for this purpose by the Japanese.    They went in about the 20th January.  PAiiTY NO.6.    It was next intended to put in a party to operate in the general direction    of KHJANG-and a standard dump was put in about 15 miles out of KLUANG off the  MERSIMJ Road. 2/Lt.Reid Engineer Manager & Director of Sawmill at KEMAMAN was  put in with this dump on the morning of Jan 34th and the remainder of his party  were to go in later in the day. They were delayed until the evening by toiich    time the Japanese had infiltrated down the railway line and cut the road making  access to the dump unsafe. 2/Lt.Reid was therefore left alone at the dump.  He is a man of outstanding jungle experience and a man of imagination and  resource and he has as sporting a chance of getting away as any.    PARTI NO.7. Previous occupation.

This party was put in the vicinity of a quarry at the head of a lane on  the left of the road running North from KOTA TINGGI to MERSING. The party was  to operate in the neighbourhood of the road. Good cover mostly jungle is  available in the area. They went in on the 27th January.    PARTY No.8. Previous occupation.  Leader Lt.Dudley Shields Mathews Planter  Second in Command 2/Lt. James METHESON Planter     Fred TALLAIOT Inspector of Prisons   David Arnold THOMPSON Accountant   Harold Roger VILLIERS /Accountant   Ernest Edward McGLASHON' Engineer   Georae BROCKMAN  Merchant    This party was put in the neighbourhood of the smaller reservoir just  south of G. FULAI -16 miles north east of J0H0R1 BAHRU on the night of Jan.  39th. They were to operate against the main road and railway running down from  the north and to a lesser extent the road running eastward from PONTIAN EETCH3L    This party was located immediately behind the large Japanese  concentrations marshalling for the assault on SINGAPORE They had un, -12    paralleled opportunities though they would have to take great risks as  they were scarcely ready for operation. The whole of this party was seen  in PADAlfG on the west coast of SUMATRA on March 8th 1942. They had  remained in and around their jungle hide-out for 3 weeks -that is until  a few days after the fall of Singapore. It appears that they achieved very  little as they found the Japanese main concentration too remote to be reached  by them without breaking cover to a dangerous extent. We are however  without details as these men were unable to leave SUMATRA before its com  plete occupation by the Japanese. They were apparently in excellent health  and spirits in FADAM3 and had had no difficulty in getting to SUMATRA. They  stated that their food and equipment had been entirely satisfactory to enable  them to live in comfort and good health in the jungle.    The Japanese reached the STRAITS OP JOHOHS on January 31st  and there operations were no longer possible. Seven men who were in  training at the school for the next party were handed over to Lt Col.  UALLEY and used by him in Dalforoe1 on SINGAPORE ISLAND.    APPRECIATION OF THE RESULTS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED.    We are without any first-hand reports of the achievements of  these parties and know only of the failure of part of No.l party and of  the successful retreat of No.8 party as far as PADAKG.    We could not expect a party to be ready to operate within 10  days of being put in. We do not believe that once SINGAPORE had fallen and  the war in MALAYA was over the parties could find targets of sufficient  importance to the war as a 'whole to warrant the risk of expense in attacking  them. We consider therefore that in view of the very rapid collapse of  British resistance at the end of the Sialayan campaign only the first four  or five parties are likely to have gone into action. Parties Nos. 2 & 3  under Major CHAPMAN may have had 3 or 4 weeks of active work and under his  resolute leadership it is difficult to believe they achieved nothing. In  particular we expect them to have made good use of their delay action devices  in night raids on transport parked armoured fighting vehicles and dumps of  fuel and ammunition. All parties had men of the calibre to under-take such  raids., THIS i    w ' TAlNeO   ORIGINAL 00     echow    IN 06PARMB    tC 0€CORG5s  3 4  l ACViy-    13    PROSPECTS OF ESCAPE FOR THE MEN.    I/hen these parties were put in it was hoped and expected  that when their 3 months had expired it would still he possible for them  to reach safety in SUMATRA. or else to filter through the Japanese lines  to SINGAPORE. With SUMATRA under Japanese control it is hard to see  how any ultimate escape is possible. They are at least one stage ahead  of their colleagues captured in SINGAPORE and if it is possible to live    V  with the natives they are the type best able to do it.  CHINESE COMMUNISTS.  British official relations with the Malayan Communist  Party appear to have settled down for some years on a mutually satisfactory  basis thanks to two main causes the tolerance by Malayan Police of the  Communists' activities as long as they were kept within reasonable bounds  by law and order and the fact that the chief secretary of the Party in  SINGAPORE was in Police pay.    On Dec. 19th 1941 the Communist Party offered their  services to assist the British in any capacity against the Japanese.    A secret meeting was held the same evening with the  chief secretary of the Party Major Chapman representing O.M. Mr. Tremlett  the Police and a representative of the S.I.S. O.M. undertook forthwith  to train and equip selected communists as leaders of guerilla bands and, THIS as & COPY  ORIGINAL QOCUMEW ' DETAINED  IN OEPARMEN SECTION  3 4 OF THE PUBUC HECORDS    ACT 1958.   A secret meeting was held the same evening with the  chief secretary of the Party Major Chapman representing O.M. Mr. Tremlett  the Police and a representative of the S.I.S. O.M. undertook forthwith  to train and equip selected communists as leaders of guerilla bands and  the secretary of the Party undertook to find the first 15 men within two  days. This and everything else he undertook was done.   Later Mr. G.E. Devonshire of the Special Branch S3  Police took over the work of liaison between O.M. and the Party. It was  unfoirtunate however that for reasons of maintaining the Party s security  arrangements all negotiations even in matters of small detail had to be  put through the Secretary This naturally led to many delays at a time   when delays were serious, -14    It ms aseantial for 0 M to.recruit Chlnose-apeokln offloors to  handle the trained communists particularly when it earns to seeing them  through the advanced British forces in the fighting areas. Mr. H.H.  Broome of the Rhineso Protectora o Malaya Civil Sorvioa and Mr. J.L.E.  Davis of the F.M.s. Police were appointed for these duties and  comissloned with the rank of Captain.    O.M a ability to put the Chinese on the ground was limited only  by equipment and at first also by training facilities. Although the  party wished to see thcacolvoa as a fighting unit in large guerilla bonds  we were not in a position to quip thorn on the scale they hoped for. 'The  cliance round from criminal to ally wo not unnaturally too abrupt for the  military to be forthcoming in supplying arms in lor e quantity at the ex  pense of regular troop a equipment    TitiNina.    'Ho agreed with the Party therefore to train selected  leaders as instructors in our methods. Standard course of 10 days  duration wore laid on at Mo.101 3.T.S. working up to 60 men per course.   The first two courses were 15 and 30 owing to limited aocosnodatlori  The first course started on Dec Slat 1941 and the first lot were  SIMOAPGHB Chinese. Subsequently up-country Chinese war brought down  for training and sent back to their own country or ns hear as possible to  it. The Communist Party found all the men froa their own ranks.    In all 165 Co umnists passed through the school between  Dec. 31st and Jan. 30th. These men particularly the first lots  included the finest men whom the school had to handle. They were all  young -mostly 17 to 30 years old -physically fit intelligent and  inspired with an almost fanatical eagerness to fight the Japanese and  prove themselves worthy of the Communist traditions. They had a Jsost  stimulating influence on Uo.101 S.T.S.    It was intended that each nan trained at the school would    become a leader of 5 to 10 men locally recruited. Arris stores and food    were issued on this basis.    Training was on a simpler basis than that given to r.uropeana    and made the most of the Chinese inherent ingenuity in making things for    himself, -15   STORES AND EQUUMEOT.   In general the Chinese were equipped in a siailar way to  the Europeans though with more of the explosives and less of the  specialised devices. Weapons were in great desaand and we spared them  all that we could particularly pistols. A we becajae better  organised standard unit dumps were made up and issued as with the  European parties.   As it was not necessary for the Chinese to remain concealed  except for short periods during their actual raids no camp equipment  was issued and their foodstuffs were limited to emergency rations  enough to tide them over the initial period when they were finding their  friends and settling down to live apparently normal lives.   All funds necessary were handed over by O.S. through the  Police to the Party This was done on the basis of a fixed sum per man  recruited up-country sufficient for him to buy kit and to provide for his  dependents for one month. No subsequent financial obligations are to be  expected.   PUTTING 'HIE HAN ON THE GEOIIKD.   The procedure adopted was as followsr   1.  Capts. Broome and Davis first ascertained from the Party the best  areas where Communist cells were strong  2.  They proceeded to these areas to survey suitable locations for  secreting the dumps.  3.  They returned to SIUGAPGKE picked up the previously prepared load of  stores with 4 to 6 Chinese and put this into the chosen spot  returning with the Chinese  4.  On completion of the training course the whole party of Chinese were  taken up to the settlement nearest to the dump or in the event of  Japanese advance beyond this in the meantime to as near the front as  possible Capts. Broome and Davis sat the Chinese through all  British units as necessary.  DETAILS RBCARBING THE INTRODUCTION OF Mill AND STORES FOLLOWt1  The first dump was placed in the area of SERMDAH on the 5th Jan.  about 20 miles north of KUALA LUMPUR The actual location of the dump is  about one mile down a mining road which leaves the main road and runs East  immediately to the South of SERENBAH town. 15 trained men were intro  duced and these gave some brief instructions to a further 150. This group   has contacts in the KUALA LUMPUR area, 16    The dump consisted of 6 T.S.M.G. and explosives grenades etc  sufficient for about 2 raonths operations. 30 bags of rice were also  left with the group.    Jjl The next dump was placed about 2 miles Korth of T.AKPIN town and    about f mile off the main road to the East. It was put in on the 11th    January.    The dump contained 5 T.S.M.G. and explosives grenades ammunition    etc. sufficient for about 2 raonths operation 15 bags of rice were also    put down    30 trained men were introduced. They have contacts in &EPJMJM  KAJAKG and TAMPEJ.    3. The next dump was placed in the area of TEHAMJ about 2& miles North  of the main road at 102 milestone on the 19th January. The dump  consists of 5 standard Chinese dumps  60 trained men with food for two weeks were introduced into a  Kampong South of CHA' AH about 4 miles off the main road on 21st  January. This group has contacts at BAHAU and in the surrounding country  side    4. The next dump was placed in the AYER BITAM area on 23rd January.  The dump consists of 5 standard Chinese dumps and was placed in the  jungle behind a Japaese estate North of AYER HITAM/KLUANG Koadii and about  1 mil from AYER HITAM Bee paragraph 8 regarding the personnel who will  use this dump.    5. The next dump was placed in the area of KLBAHG. The exact location  is in the jungle to the south of an estate road leading west at a point  5 miles from IH3SGAM on the F.jMJAM/KLDANG Road The Jungle area is  marked SUKIT KEHSTA API on map . The dump consists of 5 standard Chinese  dumps and was put in on the 25th January.  6. The next dump was placed in the PQNTIAN KECH1L area on the 27th Jan.  and consists of 5 standard Chinese dumps The exact location is in the  Jungle in the Reservoir area west of road leading to Reservoir from the  22 milestone on the SIMPANG PU1AI/P0NTIAN KECHIL Road.  7 The last dump was put into the KDTA TTOOGI area on the 29th January  The exact location is in the jungle west of a timber track which runs north, 17    from the M3HS32 3 Hoad 5 alio beyond 120TA TEiSOI The dump oonoiat  of 5 standard Chinese dumps  S The personnel for the dumps mentioned in Paragraphs 5 6 7 aM 8  rare Introduced on the 30th January 1342. The party consisted of S3  trained nm which included four son who know the exact location of the  KOTA T3HSOI TOOTIAH K3CKIL EHM and AYER HM dumps end two sen who  know the AH HTftU and 'dMyKl dumps only. The x arty v ta joined by four  sen who know the location of the PORTIAS KEaEIIL and .IOTA THYJSI dumps.   This party ms left on the border of the T3K0R Estate about 8 miles  north of the Tillage of THBBfiC Thojf have provisions for 14 days Pvery  man has a pistol tmd 17 rifles distributed oraoag the party.   The object of this party is to break up into Ksaller groups and  spread out to the areas of the four dumps.   ' 4 men whose names have been left with PeTonshire returned to  SINGAPORE with the object of enabling us to .make contact possible in  future with the personnel introduced.   Whs tlie Japanese reached JOHOR 3TRA3T It was no lonfc er possible  to put further Comimists into the mainland. Large numbers of Oorommista  offered themsolvos as fighting troops and ware taken on by B&lforce  along with other Chlueae. Excellent reports were received of their  courage and deterfidnation in action in most difficult circumstances.   rmms kemmm by ooiamMisT ggsRUJAg.   Since the fall of DZHOA/GRE on contact has been mad with those  guerillas and a first-hand report has been brought out. This was  achieved by Sept. Brooms and Copt. Davis who joined Lt Col. Barren s  party referred to above which left SBIGAPOHI on Feb. 4th for the Last  coast of SUMATRA with the express object of establishing contact through  the MALAYAN coast with the parties put in earlier from SBIMPOHS They  were accompanied by 10 Gomunista and operated from & base at BAGAKSI API   API where there is a lerge Chines fishing community. Oapts Broome and  Daviscrossed into MALAYA and remained there 34 hours. An extract from  their report reads ae follows, 19     Information obtained at SEPAIKJ on 16.2.42. from  the President of the CUNGEI P3LEK Relief 0jmittee  and some ten fellow members.  Guerillas The Graarr.unist Party now calls itself the  anit-faecist party and has thrown its ranks open to  outsiders. It has thus gained the confidence of the  Chinese labourers and is now the controlling organization  for anti-Japanese activities in MALAYA. Shopkeepers and  capitalists are inclined to stand aloof.  Considerable guerilla activity is reported from NORTH MALAYA.  The Guerilla bands there are said to have captured a quantity  of Jap transport and to be using it for their operations.  But no details of these activities are known in SIPANG.  In SELANGOR and NEGRI S1K3ILAN there are two centres of  guerilla activity where actual camps exist in the Jungle.  The main one is at TITI KONG JKLEBU area where several  thousand men have collected. In addition to the small  quantity of arms and explosives left behind for then this  party has collected additional arms from retreating British  troops. They have already been in action with the eneray  when they attacked the KUALA. PILAH Police Station and rescued  a few Australian prisoners. The Japanese retaliated and there  was a snail scale action. The guerillas claim to have  inflicted about 30 casualties. Eleven guerillas were captured  and taken to SERMBAH and executed.  This outfit is said to be nearly ready for a general  action and in fact it was suggested that they would attempt    to take smmmr.    The second centre is in the TkLOK DATGK Forest Reserve  behind BATH LAST. This is also said to be several thousand  strong but is not so well prepared and has not yet been in  action. A representative of this party visits GUMGKI PHEK  regularly and was next expected on 19th Feb.    Gorae mention was made of a band at TANAH MERAH Estate  PORT DICKSON but this was very vague.    Several bridge W.t. beer blom up by guerilla.. 0ue, 19    result Is that the railway line from K.L. to SEHEMBAH has been  declared a prohibited area and trespassers are shot at sight. The  blowing of a bridge at BANGI resulted in the massacre of several  hundred local Chinese including women and children. Another at  HALCHAU also resulted in a massacre. Blown bridges are repaired by  forced unpaid Chinese labour. Latterly the repair of bridges has been  made the responsibility of the local Maintenance Committees ...    Conclusion    The information given in this report is for the most part  reliable. In particular the information about guerillas activity is good  the informant being himself the organiser of the SEPMG branch of the  anti-fascist party and in contact with representatives of the central  organisation.    The guerillas asJc for arms and for air support. The  latter request may be a bit ambitious but if means can be found to  encourage them either with arras or at least ..ith a w/T set they should be  able to keep large numbers of Jap troops occupied fra long time. There  is any amount of good man-power available particularly in PERAK.    We were astonished to find trtiat great progress had been  made by the Chinese unaided except for the explosives dumps put in and the  small parties trained in SINGAPORE but we do feel that some sort of  encouragement and recognition from outside is necessary if the movement is  to spread and achieve substantial results .....    FUTURE CONTACT WITH CHINESE GUERILLAS IN MALAYA.    The secondary object of Lt Col. Warren s expedition was  to prepare permanent arrangements to contact MALAYA using fishermen from  the SUMATRA COAST and thence prepare contacts back to PADANG and other  ports on the West coast of SUMATRA which might remain accessible to us  even in the event of the occupation of the Japanese of key points in  SUMATRA.    It is obvious by the results already achieved by the  Chinese by mid February and from the strong plea made by Broome and Davis  in their report that every effort should he made to give physical support  to the Comiaunist Guerillas in MALAYA. This is referred to later.    ARRANGEMENTS WITB THE EDQMINTAH& CHINESE IN MALAYA, , 21    Abdaeom Headquarters in JAVA. They visited Ho.101 S.T.S. and were  naturally concerned that the recruiting of EKT Ohinese had not begun    while training and equipping of Ooimaunists had proceeded so far. It  was realised that this apparent discrimination mighc have serious    repercussions on 0.15. activities in China. Q.M therefore agreed    to take over the whole of the handling of the K&T Chinese.    It was necessary to prepare additional accommodation at  No.101 S.T.S. at a time when the school staff were already fully  employed on the work reported above. They were ready however to  receive the first Chinese recruits on Jan. 21st. The numbers had to  be limited to 25 per course.    The first course proceeded according to plan but the  material judged as potential fighting guerillas was in no way  comparable to that provided by the Communist Party. The men were of  the town-living type and their training was modified therefore as  they expected to conduct their activities under cover of their normal  occupations such as house boys shopkeepers etc. They intended to  find their way to towns behind the enemy lines and after settling down  would operate mainly against individual Japanese Officers    At this petiod the retreat from MALAYA was very sapid  and before the first &MT course was completed it was necessary to  place their dump of stores on the mainland. This dump was put in  on Jan. 30th into a small patch of jungle 3 miles from J0H0RE BAHRU.  Two of the KMT officers and some of the trainees assisted in this  simple operation but their performance supported the view already  formed at the school that little or nothing was to be expected of  these men    British and Imperial Forces retreated on to SINGAPORE  ISLAND the following day and it was not possible to put these Chinese  on to the mainland. They were turned over to Dalforce and used in  the defence of the Island. The Chinese officers left MALAYA four  days before the surrender, itXBlBUmKS FOR FUTUm    Since they captured SB'OA ORE the Japanese have probably iusl no  need to keep more than the gaallest forces in the Mainland of MhLAXA. They  used arly sufficient tc keep SB'HAKffitE sad secure ns linval Bases  and to ensure maintenance of civil rder in such areas as they require for  production of rubber and tin They have now far riore of those than they  need so are not likely to ttesapt to work nore than a fraction of the  MAimN Plantations and Mines.    CLIITRAL MA1ATA is therefore likely to be fertile soil for  rebellion.    There is in MALAYA now a large Chinese population with a strong  OQKss&unistle element running through it especially in the Tin Mining  areas of P1RAK The GoaramiEte are liteely to be gaining in power as the  Japanese nre hlnoet certainly failing to provide adequate eaployaent or food i  in this area. As reported above it is o little south of here that the  two Comuniat bands recruited by our own traineos were functioning in a  rsaarkEtbly short space of tixae.    In addition there wore in MaLAYA many hundreds or even  thousands of British and luperiol troops who had been out off and who had  boon looked after by native residents particularly Chinese. Many of these  may still be free and by now thoroughly aaclisatiaed to living ia the  country. In addition there are the 41 Europeans put in by O.M. or as  nany of them as are still in MALAYA.    The above which are admittedly in the absence of intelligence  not nore than possibilities warrant in our opinion every effort being  made to re-establish contact with MALAYA to arrange permanent contact  particularly W/T. The following is suggestedi   1. To retain either Capt. Davis or Capt. Broome or possibly both  for this work. To contact and keep in touch with other members of  the late Special Branch of the 5S Police in particular Mr K. L.  Lynne the head of this section who is believed to have escaped  Mr. O.I. Devonshire and Mr. I. Trcralott who is in Australia.  2. Through the above to recruit Chinee agente especially in CALCUTTA.  3. To send these agents into MALAYA either through SUMATRA in co  operation with the Dutch from secret landings or by direct secret  landings on the mainland of the MALAY PifmiOJLA or overland from  3 BURMA or CSUHA the latter being obviously a slow process though, -as    not necessarily of insuperable difficulty.   4.  It ia hoped ultimately to ssaissL orna explosives and ../T  equipment. It is not impossible t at tlx Coaamists might go  so for ne to seise aerodromes in MALAGA after v hlch contact  by aircraft could bo arranged in the more distant future.  operating on their own the Chines are not likely to be of .or  than Halted nuicunce value to the Japanese. They ax'o not likely to mke  any serious attempt to attack a fa/lPOSE KlifihG or other strategic points  nor could they hope for any success in doing so. If the Japanese have no  economic needs in their particular areas they may well be left to stew in  their own juice.   We believe that these CsmmlatB can if properly handled be of  vital use artioularly ia gaining control of areas which contain or might  contain possible airfields. With an airfield in Comunist hands it might  in due course be possible for us not only to send in stores w/T sets by  air but to establish touch with British troops in MALMEft. and get then  out to recuperate it is from those men that we may expect leaders for  combined British and Chinese forces in MMAYA which sight be able to  threaten the Japanese occupied points and other aerodromes or at least  to fore the Japanese to keep a larger army of occupation in MALAYA, APPENDIX 1    O    The followiag was the equipment Issued for a party of six men.    1.

FOOD.  Each party was Issued with sufficient food to enable it to  operate for 3 months without outside help. It was hoped that this, APPENDIX 1 Page 3.    might be extended if it were found possible and safe to obtain food from    natives locally. The food was chosen after taking medical advice as to    balanced rations and was as followss-   BALAHCED RATION.    Six men for two days.    One sack containing    6 tins Bully varied in every third sack vfith equivalent weight of  sausage etc. even no. of tins .    2 Potatoes.  1 n Carrots or Peas or Onions or Baked Beans.  1 Cabbage or Carrots or Cauliflower or Beetroot.    2 Cheese  1 Butter    1 n Jam    2 Milk  1 Herrings or 2 tins Salmon or 4 tins Sardines.  2 n Fruit  1 Salt 1 lb. 16  1  Oatmeal 2 lbs.  1 B Marmite or Kescafe or delicacy 2 lbs.    One tin containing    8 packets Army Biscuits  8 Indian Army Biscuits.  3 lbs. Rice. 3 lbs  3 n Sugar 3  12 ozs.

Tobacco  60 cigarettes  6 boxes matches  1 packet toilet paper.    The food was subdivided into small lots each being 2 days ration    for 6 men. Perishable foodstuffs were packed in tins hermetically sealed    and were insect proof and weather proof. Tinned goods were dipped in wax and    put in sacks. One tin and one sack represented one two-day ration.    Emergency rations were also provided.    5. Medical Stores.  Each party had full medical stores chosen for jungle conditions    with instructions., APPENDDC  1. Page 41    6.  Punds  Each party was given §1 000.00 in small denominations.  7. Conuaunicationa.  Time and lack of equipment and of trained men did not permit  attaching 2 way W/T to more than one party. The remainder were  given battery operated broadcast receivers to get the ordinary news  any special messages were put on to the M.3.C broadcast programme.    Every possible care was devoted to the fitting out of these  parties and it is hoped that in spite of the very great haste  necessary to get them on to the ground in reasonable numbers before  the enemy arrived all men had enough to make life in jungle  conditions tolerable.    Reports from No 8 party see page 11 of main report which  reached SUMATRA stated that they were able to live in very fair  comfort, APPENDIZ 2. BY MAJOR H.A. CAMPBELL     a   a a  - --  b   b b  - --  c   c c  - --  b   b b  - -- In addition to the valuable results which may accrue from the seeds  sown by the Malayan Chinese Communist Party amongst the Malayan Chines  population as a whole there exists in MALAYA a large Indian population  which is ready to be used. This is chiefly employed on estates rubber  coconut and oilpalm -and offers still wider scope for fruitful  activities.  During the campaign in MALAYA the behaviour of the Indian population  was very good and especially so in the country areas. Much concrete  evidence is available of valuable assistance being rendered to our  troops and especially to those who were cut off and had to seek shelter   vide reports of Officers and men who escaped early via. Sumatra .  The majority of estates on the West coast of the country where the  large centres are situated and through which the main lines of  communication pass are almost in toto populated by South Indian  labourers Tamils Telegus Malayan .  These labour forces are long established and have been European  controlled since their institution. This has consisted of good care  in housing feeding and protection. Bearing in mind the economic  situation in the country firstly as regards exploitation of estates  and secondly in regard to adequate food conditions of estate labour  must have deteriorated to a marked degree. Amelioration of these  conditions would appear to be difficult to the enemy for some time to  come and aggravation of discontent amongst the people appears certain  to grow.  It is proposed that estate labour forces be used to create dis  order and sabotage in chosen areas.  Co-ordinated with Chinese Fifth Column activity mass organised un  rest amongst the Indian population of the country would be a valuable  \, APPENDIX 2.  Page 2.    asset before and most certainly when the battle to re-take MALAYA Is  carried into the country.  Contacts and preparation of the scheme generally outlined can be  achieved as follows    1. By special training of selected South Indian military personnel  for sabotage to be introduced into the country and inter-mingled  with superficially innocent estate labour forces.  2.  By the training of picked South Indiansnon Propaganda preferably  men who have worked in the country previously but who still have  family connections in MALAYA to be used to cause civil unrest and  antagonism to the Japanese.  3.  By the use of certain European officers who have previously worked  in MALAYA and who have handled and are known to labour forces to  maintain contact with introduced groups and direct their activities.   Method of introduction of agents into the country will be the  subject of a special report .  MALAYS.  At this juncture it would appear that little or no usefulness can be  expected from the Malay population in MALAYA.  Both previous to and at the time the Japanese were attacking in the  country complete indifference as to the final outcome was generally  evident amongst them.  That Fifth Column was rife especially In the North is admitted but  this was undoubtedly the result of Japanese bribery and promises rather  than a genuine desire to see the end of British rule in the country.  Strangely enough the occupation of MALAYA by the Japahese will have  less bearing on the natives of the country e.g. MALAYS than on any  other. The repercussions will be felt by Chinese and Indians. Y\    .    Shortage of food will cause them little worry as they normally live  in a most frugal way and this is almost entirely supplied from the  small Kampongs they cultivate.    Their financial investments are few and their lives are con-\  ducted in seclusion in sparsely populated areas. Practically no  change should take place in their normal way of living.    It is considered conclusive that no active support can be  forthcoming until such time as the ousting of the Japanese from the  country is evident. Limited assistance can always be obtained by    bMbsrr should this be imperotl, APPMDIX. 3.   Page 3   In conclusion It say be reasonably aasut-iod that in a  aahem involving the use of races in Malaya against the Japanese the  Malay population should bo ignored in general but if part is used for aom  specialised purpose it should be a sdniiauiii and should be neticulously checked  over and supervised,  9kc- a Mr t .

Arrangements were therefore made through the  Resident at Padang and the Harbourmaster at hmmahaven for the purchase of a native  sailing craft fairly new and well found and capable at this time of the year of  making the ocean passage to Ceylon. this craft will be used as a last resort to    evacuate  Lt. Col. Warren's.and Major Campbell1s parties and a few selected others.    If the Japanese occupy Padang and other key points in Sumatra as they  may be expected to do it becomes our responsibility to maintain contact with  Sumatra through secondary channels using minor ports and lesser roads where the  Japanese are unlikely to come in force. This will be laid on in Ceylon and it  is hoped that two way communications can be maintained not only to get out the troops  who may be able to get out of iagapcre for months to come but to keep in touch  with supporters in Malaya itself.    -Lhe following persons in order of priority have given the greatest  service to us in the above operations and we hope that they will not go  unrecognised.    1. Lt. Weening Quartermaster Padang who in spite of pressing problems of  his own from the Hutch Military devoted nearly all his time and energy for  several weeks to the problems of billeting and feeding the large numbers of troops  which poured into Pfdsng.  2. Mr. H. Levison H.B.M. Vice-Consul Padang who acted unceasingly and  with infinite patience as Liaison Officer between ourselves and the Dutch.  5.  Ihe Manager of the Colliery at S&wahloentoe.  4.  Lt. Commander Moelde Harbour-Master at Emmahaven the port of Padang .  5.  The Manager of the Railways at Padang.  6.  Capt. Steemford acting commander of the Padang Garrison.  7.  The Resident at Rengct the Controller at Djambi and the Resident at  Padang.  The above is a preliminary report. Detailed documentations will be  provided when the writerb notes become available end when the personnel of the  operations who are en route arrive here.    COLOMBO. 15th March 1942.     Signed  0.105., Q.M.  SUMATRA. OPFitATIONS  X. Contact with the mainland of Malaya from the Mist  coast of Sumatra  2 Organisation of Singapore escape routes and of  contacts through the Rhio Archipelago to Sumatra    1  Contact with the Malayan Mainland    O.M operations in Malaya which have been reported  separately came to an end with the investment of  Singapore by the Japanese on February 1st 1942 It was  not then possible to put trained guerilla troops through  the enemy lines and Naval commitments did not permit  running landing expeditions to the coast of the Mainland    0 M. therefore turned their attention to indirect  contact with Malaya via the coast of Sumatra The  possibilities of such contact had received strong support  with the arrival in Singapore of Lt.Yanyenen Lt.Graham  and later Lt.Hembry three members of the first left  behind party who had remained North of Kuala Lumpur  early in January. Having been unable to carry on opera  tions in that area they had moved down to the coast of  Selangor through enemy occupied territory. With the assist  ance of Chinese fishermen they had crossed to Bagan-siapi- api on the Sumatra coast and thence back to Singapore  via Pakanbaroe aerodrome They reached Singapore at the  end of January.    They  reported conditions in Selangor to be as follows     a  The Japanese were very thin on the ground and  had little in the way of guards for lines of  communication   b  It was an easy matter to move about behind the  enemy lines   e  There ware grpat numbers of British and Imperial  troops at large and living with natives particu  larly Chinese.   d.  The native population was giving all help to the  above. Chinese and to a less extent Indians  were most helpful. Malays were found untrust  worthy., After our disoussioas with Vanyanan and Graham  it was decided to equip and despatch an expedition forth  with to the Sumatra coast to establish contact both with  our European and Chinese guerilla parties. It was hoped  that this expedition would also be able to assist the  escape to Su atra of the above troops living in lalaya.    This expedition was prepared in a few days. A small  coasting vessel s.s. Hin Lee of about 40 tons was  requisitioned on our behalf by the Navy and fitted out.  Lt.B Passmore R.N.7.R. of No. 101 STS and Lt.Lind  Malayan R.N.V.R. were in charge of the vessel. The party  consisted of a Lt.Tanvenan and Lt.Graham b Capt.  R.N.Broome and Gapt. J.L.H.Davis our experts on the  Chinese with 10 selected Chinese communists. Lt.Col.  A.G.Y arran R M. was in command of the expedition.    The party sailed from Singapore on Feb. 3rd 1942.  They made straight for the swampy islands due Last of  Singapore and worked their way northward through the  shallow muddy channels inside the islands. They  established contact with the Dutch at Bengkalis and  moved thence north-eastwards to Bagan-si-api-api  where they established their headquarters. They were  outside the range of Japanese reconnaisanoe aircraft  though these were heard from time to time.    Bagan is alleged to be the second largest fishing  community in the world and the population is largely  Chinese. Communist influence is strong but is much  more i i prously repressed by the Dutch than by the  British in Malaya. It was necessary for Col. ' arrento  work with great tact and it did not prove possible to use  the Chinese as openly and freely as he had done in  Malaya.    It was found x ossible nevertheless to arrange visits  to Malaya.     a Capt.Broome and Capt.Davis crossed in a Chinese  fishing junk to the Malayan port of Sepang in Southern  Selangor which they reached on Feb. 16th. They had no  difficulty in contacting the local representatives of the  Communist party from whom they got a report on the  activities of the Chinese guerillas who had been put in  by 0 M. a month previously. For detail see O.M.Malaya  report under the Chinese section . Unfortunately shortl  after the party s arrival at Sepang the Japanese issued  orders that the harbour was to be cleared of all shipping  and it was necessary for them to return after only 24  hours in Malaya. They are however satisfied that their  contacts in Sepang can be relied upon at any time to  receive agents and they recommend Sepang as t e best  port for reopening such contacts as soon as circumstances  permit.  Capts. Broome and Davis returned to Bagan without  incident.    Meanwhile Lts. Vanvenan and Graham had also left  Bagan to cross over to Malaya. It was their intention, to attempt to reestablish oontact with the European    left-behind parties in the Selangor and Negri Sembilan  areas and in particular if nossible to find Major    Chapman and his party which ihey had had to leave a  month before see Malayan reprt These officers did not  return to Sumatra according to schedule. Capta Broome    and Davis waited 10 days in Bagan for them and then    rejoined Col.Warren. Nothing was heard of Vanrenan and  Graham up to March 8th the latest date of news from    Sumatra. It is hoped that they have remained in Malaya    deliberately with on of the parties of Europeans.    Col.Warren was now operating further North especially  at Labnan Bilik and up the rivers of that estuary. In the  two to three weeks that the party was in that area an  excellent knowledge of this area was obtained and this is  likely to be of value for planning secret bases for future  Malayan operations. In addition Col.Warren established  close relations with General Overakker the Dutch C.in C.  Central Sumatra.    On instructions from 0.100 in Batavia Col.Warren  withdrew his party to the West coast during the last week  in February. A visit was paid to Slbolga and to other  small ports on the west coast of Sumatra and the party  then concentrated in Padang and left by native craft on  March 8th see below Col.Warren remaining behind.    It is hoped that with the contacts made by this  expedition it will be possible for any agent reaching  the ast coast of Sumatra between Labuan Bilik and Bengkalis  to obtein assistance and to get into Malaya.    With the Japanese now in occupation of Sumatra the  problem is to reach the &ast coast of Sumatra. The coast  is too shallow for submarines and too dangerous for air  craft. Access via the west coast of Sumatra depends on  help from the Dutch and the natives. These possibilities  are nov/ being actively explored by S.O. India in Ceylon  with the close cooperation of the Dutch.    H. Rhio Archipelago and the Singapore Escape route  0 M. Singapore had for some time an eye on the Rhio  Archipelago the maze of small islands South and South West  of Singapore.    It was known that the Japanese had secret observations  posts overlooking Singapore and the entrance to the Naval  Base and had secret radio transmitters there. As the  fall of Singapre became more and more of a probability  we felt that it was essential to establish some contacts  in these Islands so that in due course we could introduct  our own agents and use the idands both as observation  points and as jumping off points for S.O. operations  against the Japanese in Singapore.    Capt I.Lyon Gordons with whom we had had close  associations on other matters had for some time been a    keen supporter of such proposals., of organizing the escape of prisoners of war and of    troops not immediately rounded up in the event of the fa]    of Sinrapore.    It was obvious that there would b many who would rq  to extreme lengths to avoid being put into Japanese  prison carps Those who knew the Jananese were convinced  that during the first week or two of a Japanese occupatic  of Singapore they wouldbe too preoccupied with looting ai  good living to go to great trouble to round up stragglerf  Men who had the courage and initiative to get away then  would be the men most worth getting back into service  elsewhere.    The matter was discussed informally at the daily  meetin ibf the War Council on or aboui Jan. 31st and it  was suggested that it was a job which O.M. might handle.  This was accepted readily as we had suitable personnel  just rendered idle with the ending of our Malayan opera-  tions and as this work would eaable us to build up at  the same time Dutch and native contacts in Rhio and  Sumatra as above.    An expedition was organised forthwith under Major    T.A. Campbell with Capt Lyon and a medical orderly andl  two O.Rfs from No.101 S.T.S. The s.s. Hongchuan of abou  50 tons was chartered with stores end crew and covered  for War Risks. The Navy loaned Lt.Petrie R.N.R. and  2 Master Mariners to take charge of the vessel. The  party sailed from Singapore on Feb. 3rd 1942.    It was clear that to escape from Singapore to  Sumatra would be an easy task for anyone with resource  and the ability to handle small craft. The prevailing  wind at least till the end of March was N.l leading  straight to Sumatra though the mass of small densely  forested tropical islands lyin South and South West of  Singapore. These would provide cover from aircraft by  day for small craft and shelter from heavy seas. It was  expected however that troops escaping from Singapore  would be short of food and water which they could notrelj  upon getting en route add would be without maps or  compasses. The plan for the Campbell-Lyon party was  therefore    a. To select a simple route vie readily recognizable  islands of which a description could be circulated in  Singapore 'it the ppropriate time.  b. To place dumps of emergency food and water at certaii  selected islands and arrange guards for them. The  existin organization for packing balanced rations in  sealed tins for the Malayan left behind parties was  turned over for this purpose forthwith .   c To visit all possible native settlements along and  near the route and inform the headman of each of the  villages to direct escaped prisoners to the food dumps.  d. To organise transport in Sumatra to take men through,  e To organiso rest camps an route on the  mainland and at Padang   f To defray expenses which might be incurred by  the Dutch authorities on our behalf.  The above was to be carried out on the expectedscale of 1 000 escaped prisoners coming through at  the rate of 50 in each batch.   At the same time Q.M. went into the possibilityof collecting native craft on Singapore Island into  certain areas and concealing them with an iron ration  of food and water in each. This plan was abandoned  however as there was the great risk of these caches  becoming known to the Japanese and the whole scheme  being thereby jeopardised. It was thought that men  escaping would have no great difficulty in finding  craft of some kind all along the coast of the Island  and this afterwards proved correct at any rate to  begin with.   On feb. 7th S.S. Hongchuan returned under Lt.  Petrie R.N.R. with Pajor CampbelL s and Captain Lyon's  report having left them in the Indragiri River country. They reported that their arrangements had gone according  to plan. The very greatest help bad been given by the  Dutch authorities throughout and by the fishing comauni  ies on the islands. A main food dump had been put  on a headland at the Rastem tip of Durian Island  conspicuous from afar to anyone takin the obvious route  through the Goegi Strait by a tall dead tree against  the skyline and a rocky islet. Three natives had been  commissioned to keep watch and to go out in sampans to  bring in passers-by. A second main dump had been put  in at Prigi Pnjah near the main mouth of the IndragiriRiver in Sumatra. The original plan was to make for  the Samper River but this proved impracticable for  this river has few settlements along its banks owing  to its strong tidal bore . The report asked for another  dump to be put in at Pulo Salu a small but very con  spicuous islet about 10 mites S.V of Singapore.   A draft was now prepared settin out in the  simplest term.s the instructions to guide escaped troopsalong this chain. This was submitted to G.H.Q. throughLt.Colonel Marsh lellett G I 1 and passed by him in  suitable form to the G.O.C.Melaya. This raised of course 1  the principal dancer of the scheme that its prematuredisc'osure would be an incentive for desertion. The  information had not been circulated by the G.O.C. bythe 13th February whan Lt. Colonel Marsh Kellett left  Singapore but there is evidence that it was passedround subsequently.   In view of the most encouraging report from Major, Campbell and Cantain Lyon and in view of the  increasing likelihood of disaster in Singapore  it was deci ed to send a second expedition to the  islands with the particular object of visiting the  communities on the islands nearer to Singapore. The   s.s. Hongchuan which was still at our disposal wasprepared again and stocked with further food and water  for additional dumps. Meanwhile instructions were  receive' from Batavia for the muter to leave Singaporeand he therefore took command of the expedition taking0.114 the last remaining member of 0 M. staff in  Singapore and who had now no further duties. The  other members of the rarty were Commander Petrie R.K.T.R  who had been in charge of the planning of the naval  side of the previous expedition Lt.Petrie R.N.R. and  two naval ratings 2nd Lt.Pembry from the first  Malayan left behind party and Sgt. Lamb from No  101 S.T.S.   This expedition departed on the afternoon of  Feb. 11th and put in the dump asked for in Pulo Sabu  without incident apart from some machine gunning byJapanese aircraft vhich caused no damage or casualties  they then proceeded via various islands to Djajpbi in  Sum tra.   Meanwhile as the time fact r was a most importantitem on completion of the reconnaisance of the  Indragiri River from Prigiraja to Rehgat MajorCampbell deci ded that the route of escape would best  be consolidated by dividing attention between sea and  river communications and land transport to Padang.   Capt.Lyon therefore returned to check up on the  river an outer islands and Major Campbell proceededahead to link up with Padang.   A small base camp was established approx matsly30 miles down the river from Rengat which was adequate  to deal with numbers arriving as originally expectedand local bus transport was arranged to transportthese direct to Padang. This later proved totallyinadequate \   It had hover been expected when this scheme was  originally discussed that there wuld hgi such largenumbers escaping to Sumatra for fully 1.0 days before  Singapore fell. To be sure a fair proportion of these  particularly the earlier ones were persons who had only  the slenderest reasons for leaving their employment  and there ware many who were without dpubt deserters  both military and civilian.   From about Feb. 0th onwards -that is almost  immediately after the Japanese had made their landing  on Singapore Island -a steady stream of small craft  was flowing out of Singapore. Certain wealthyChinese had already gone some in junks their  arrangements having been made long before irtually  every serviceable power driven craft in the oort  had been earmarked largely by civilians who were in k  touch with the harbour authorities.   A., It is unfortunate that those first oomsrs who least  deserted helping inevitably availed themselves of the  facilities in Sumatra prepared by Major Campbell They  did not touch the food dumps however as they wore in  general wall provisions on board.   During the lact throe days Feb. 13th 14th and 15th  it would sW r a survivors stories that many officers in  charge of units vshc could no lcn er parfor their duties    e.g. particularly service units R.A.S.C. Ordnance etc.  gave their Bum parsdsiion to get out if they could.  Several hundred men got aw&v m these daya aainly in native  craft using oars or primitive sails e good ip.any also  were f.bls to repair motor driven craft which had been out  of order eoae rowed such craft out of danger and repaired  them at sea or on the small neighbouring islands.  On Feb. Ifth & large number believed to be about  1 500 officers end non left Singapore in naval auxiliaryvessels. These were selected men who were chosen to leave  up to the limit of shipping space available and included   staff end e large number of technical specialists.  Some left in small craft and made straight for Sumatra  not having the range to reach Batavia. Those in largercraft suffered serious casualties in shipping and personnel  for the Japanese increasingly heavy and continuous attacks  on all shipping leaving .Singapore readied their climax  that day. Survivors from bombed vessela including over  100 wounded reached Singkep Island Fonpong Island northof Lingga other islands and various points on the Dumtra  coast whenco rfter seme days' hardships in my ease they  wore able to reach the Indragiri Bivar. A good many men  in power driven craft reached Bengkalis and proceeded up the  Disk River to Pakunbaroe.   Mon who left after the Cease ire1' had a difficult  time finding any craft at all. 3'nv boldly rowed sampans  out from the Singapore River and R chore Canal well within  the city. Others made for the Yacht Club only to find the  remaining craft stove in. One party repaired & damaged dinghy by night end sailed away in it. It lies been  reported that one party took sliding seat four from the  Rowing Club and pot safely to the Dutch Island Other  men finding no uncki.eged craft round the harbour walked  for miles along the beeches till they found small native  craft of one sort or another hidden sway. One man  peddled himsalf on a piece of timber with hie hands to  Pulau Bukur. whore he joined others in a seo-worthy boat.    All the non speek highly of the help riven by the  natives in the firat islands run with money were able  to buy larger craft and masts and sails. Thanks to the  prevailing MT.monsoon any craft with a sail however small  could maka a slow peed in the right direction.   Large numbers of men. appear either to have  reached the village of Moro Penjoe on certain Ttiaps  vie Durian Strait whence they were directed to the  food dump on Durian Island or to have come straight down the Soegi Strait and been picked up by our look, out men at Durian Island who went out to bring them  in. Some of theae mm. who arrived tired often with  no food or water and with no certainty of their next  i ove apeak of the discover of an organization to  help the on as aomilling of e parade. By this tire  Captain Lyon had organised his ferry service frcm Durian  Island to tho Indr giri and those whose oraft ware not  suitah1 for th final passage wore taken on by his  Othere were able to hire junks in Moro to take then to  Sumatra   Captain Lyon was greatly assisted in these operationsby Mr. Reynolds an Australian who owusk a Japanese fish  ing vessel. Hr.Reynolds subsequently reached Indie via  the Halacca Straits with this valuable craft.   By following the directions Left at Durian Island  there seams to have been no difficulty in picking up the  In'ragiri Diver. Those who were carried off their course  by strong tides were put right by fishermen along the  Sum tra coast   Meanwhile on the noinland Hajo -Campbell had made  great progress with rest camps and transportation arrange  ments.   He reports &S follows   On arrival in Pad&ng Major Campbell ascertained  that approxi' ately 60 officers and men were at various  points in Sumatra having already escaped by boat and  fishing craft from. Malays lorth of Sinranore. Arrange  ments were made to collect all such British personnel from  Malaya at once and these were concentrated in the first  rest camp in Packing The assistance rendered by Dutch  Military and Civil authorities was splendid. The  operation was completed and the camps running when MajorCampbell returned to Ken gat on the 15th February to find  escapees already arriving up the rivor in hundreds.   Hew arrangements had to be made forthwith sad  through the kind offices of Mr.Taness Swiss Managerof Ayer Moloek Estate his factory buildings were turned  over to be used os an emergency camp. Although lacking in  practically all oth r comfort this emergency camp had  abundance of running water and was situated 30 miles upriyar from Rengat. which was ideal from the roint of view of  being wel. removed from Rengat village where conditions  in regard to food and amenities war not good.   Supplies for the new forawd camp were readily  forwarded from tho Military source in Pddang where, Captain da Keyser as renderin'7 us excellent help. These supplies continued until the camp was emptiedin the first few days of March and were always supplied  immediately on cabled demand.   Transport by bus was at first easily accomplished  by close collaboration with Lieut. Towers xxi -Byns the  Military Commandant at orgat and speedier evacuation was  possible. Later hop ever the Dutch authorities started to  evacuate their soldiers wives and children from the FMo  Archipelago and difficulties started to arise wing to the  large demand combined with the general poor conditions of  the transport which could not stand up to the strenuous   running   To avoid a bottleneck at Rang&t transport had to b  continued by river. This was a slow and tedious process  and meant a further towage of some 14 hours west alongthe Indiagirl River to Ayer Moloek. but saved serious  repercussions from a foo'3 and disciplinary point of vi w  in Rangat.   Viomen and civilians were now arriving adds small camp  for th first 40 women to arrive was set up in the Rest  House near Ayer Moloek. Male civilians were acconur. dated  in a Military Camp at the rubber factory and received the  same treatment and evacuation as military personnel.   By this time transport of our troops to Padang had  slowed down considerably the journey from Ayer Moloek to  Sawah loentoe proving too much for the transport available  and numbers in Ayer Moloek were at times over 800 The  railway transport from the rail head was excellent Efforts  to secure additional military transport to ease the situation  by Major Campbell by visiting Padang were not rewarded with  any great results as the Dutch authorities were now under  taking very considerable transport and disposition of troops  wives and children in the r ort da Kook area and still further  transport by train had to be resorted to. Another emergency  camp was started in Tallek in the Market Building Motor  transport from Ayer Moloek to Dawahloentoa was thus halved  and eased the position alon the whole line of communications  but transport was still slow and difficult.   The presence of woman at Ayer Moloek and the information  that mare were being rescued and brought in from the islands  necessitated the forming of 8 chain of rest c mps for their  reception. This was arranged accordingly at To11ek.and  Sawahloentoe In oonjuhction with Mr.Levicon the Briti h  Vice Consul in Padaig accommodation for 100 women and children  was provided in that town. Accommodation provided for 50  wounded bed cases at the Salvation Army Hostel was included  in this total.   9, During the vshol process of transporting troops  across the country special care to arrangements were  given for the sick and wounded. Transport on all  occasions was arranged an- provided through MajorCampbell&rgan tE8.tion.   On March 1st a signal was received from Colonel  Warren for Major Campbell to a rendezvous in Padangwith Captain Lyon and the party operating in the  Indragiri This was dons on March 4th.   On March 6th Ayer Moloek camp was empty and about  150 men only including Colonel Tillon were outside Padang. These were at Taloek having moved to tha t camp by river  and were now awaittransport to Sawahloentoe.   There were about 700 man in Padang.   Meanwhile officers and men arriving in Padangwereproceeding with their own arrangements. The numbers cosingforward from Sawahloentoe a Goveminent owned coal ining  centra of some size and a rail head with ample accommodation  and first class hospital facilities which were most  generously made available were telephoned to Psdang wherebyj  arrangements with tha Manager of the railways specialtrains were laid on to bring the men over to Padsng with  the mini.mum delay.   In Padang satisfactory arrangements for reception  and billeting of considerable numbers had been made. The  preparations made by Major Campbell who projected for partiesof 50 or so at a time were greatly overloaded for up  to nearly 1000 men were in Padang at a time. With the  help of the Dutch military two additional schools were  requisitioned provided with wooden benches for sleeping  quarters and with field kitchens. Adequate ration  were provided in spite of local food shortage.   It is unfortunate that in spite of all the help giventhere were cases of disorder among the troops billeted in  Padang. Arms were sold and given away to the local  inhabitants to the great embarrassment of the Dutch  and there was some looting of shops.   A headquarters was set up in the Dutch Club at Padang.  Advances of pay were made to men and as each batch of  occupants left by ship one responsible officer remained behii  to assist the next batch through.   By Far 16th 150 men had re chad Padang and a naval  officer with the party sent a signal in clear to the  British Havel Commander Batavia asking for a ship. A  destroyer arrived in Lmmahaven on the afternoon of Feb.  18th and took these men off to Batavia together with 100  otters who had since arrived., Subsequent arrangements for evacuation ships  were raeute through Mr Levi son the British Yioe Consul  who held the Naval Shore Code and reciphering tables.

Nothing is known of the, circumstances but if we are to believe the Japaneseclaims that they rounded up 900 British troops when theytook Padang on March l th 3.S.

Toers Byngs, , THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT  RETAINED IN DEPARMENT  UNDER SEC I V v OF  THE PUBLiC RECORDS  ACT 1958., f   OM/P    Before Pacific War    The purpose of the formation of this organisation was to    originate and control covert propaganda against Japan and    the Japanese wherever they might reside. The nature of    the propaganda undertaken was that which could not he done    hy the Ministry of Information. To achieve this the    following types of organisation were set up    a. Executive  b. Planning  c. Research  d. Operational.  Under the general direction of 0.100 these sections controlled    all the anti-Japanese propaganda released until the outbreak    of war in all Far Eastern territories and gave directives to    the United States for the work of their organisation.    Operational organisations were    a. News and Rumours  Through an agreement reached with a world-wide news organisation  it was possible for us to release news presented from 'our  point of view and to release rumours on an international basis.  Some seventy-two newspapers in British and Allied countries  were secretly influenced. Indirectly other major news chains  were influenced through this organisation it was one of our  most efficient anti-Japanese weapons.    b. Radio  World radio coverage for rumours and our particular type of news  was controlled from Singapore. Malaya the Philippines and  the United States provided direct hook-ups. London and  Australia were indirectly available to us. In addition to  special nevrs and rumours our organisation provided Japanese and  other Oriental language broadcasts.    c. Literature Production  We were the only people capable of initiating writing and  printing anti-Japanese literature in all Oriental languages in  our own secret printing offices set up for this purpose. The  material used was frequently supplied to other Allied xrorld  organisations for their use in the countries in which they were    concerned., a Film Laboratory   Feature films and documentaries were prepared on a commercial    basis and released through ordinary commercial channels. These    pictures -mainly fakes presented British and anti-Japanese    propaganda in a most acceptable form. Films were produced    with Oriental sound -Javanese Thai and Chinese were amongst    the languages used.    e. Economic Research Bureau  This research organisation -the only organisation of its kind  in the Far East and we believe the Empire -was concerned  with the production of both day-to-day anti-Japanese propaganda  which included newspaper articles broadcast material etc.  and long-range research. Staff included amongst its members  economists journalists research workers and language experts.    f. Liaison  This organisation was concerned with co-relating work of the    Chinese and other anti-Japanese organisations. It also    subsidised the production of anti-Japanese literature through    these organisations.    6 Distribution    Distribution organisations were provided to ensure the effect   ivity of all forms of material produced. This organisation    proved itself to be adequate by test.    h. Production and Handling  We established advertising and printing companies employing    specially trained artists special compositors to meet the    language requirements and high-grade technicians.    Outbreak of Pacific War    On the outbreak of war it was arranged that with the exception  of our news and rumours organisation and certain distributing    activities all operational units would be passed to the  Ministry of Information. At the time this was agreed upon  Malaya had been invaded. Unfortunately these plans were never  fully put into effect as events showed that the Ministry of    Information Far Eastern Bureau was not in a position to assume    such control. In actual practice the reverse was the result.  OM/P eventually had to undertake control of Ministry of  Information Far Eastern Bureau in order to ensure continuity  of British propaganda in the Far East., 3.  Officers of OM/P undertook the following activities for the  Ministry of Information    a. Adviser on re-organisation  h. Acting Director Far Eastern Bureau  c. Press Attache Chungking  d. Director of Publicity Chungking  e. Ministry of Information Representative Burma  f. Controller Research Bureau formerly E.R.B.  In addition to ensure operation many of the other important  executive and technical posts available in the Ministry of  Information organisation are now being held by OM/P officers  either given to the Ministry or seconded for this work.    Summary    From the foregoing it is evident that OM/P contributed a  great deal to the British war effort prior to the outbreak of  the Pacific war. Examples of this activity before and since  the outbreak include the following    a. German Fifth Column in Japan Craigie's telegrams  praising effectiveness of this work.  b. Secret Japanese French Indo-China agreement used  by President Roosevelt in the Kurusu Mission  discussions.  c. Material provided by the Economic Research Bureau  for universal use.  d. Organisation of the film unit which although not  fully effective at the outbreak of war has been  passed over fully operative to the Ministry of  Information.  e. On the outbreak of war provision by OM/P of  leaflets for air-raids etc. in Oriental languages  printed from types collected by OM/P.  f. Provision of competent staff to undertake broadcasts  in Japanese.  g. Provided the Ministry of Information with adequate  technical staff to cope with their extended  activities and  h. Assumption of control in order to keep British  propaganda active when the Far Eastern Bureau ceased  to function., 4    Future Work    In addition to this work OM/P has completed an agreement with  the Chinese Government which enables it to continue to  function along the lines recently laid down by London.    The simple truth is that not one unit brought into operation  by OM/P has been found wanting. All have undertaken the  task assigned to them. In addition the high standard of  OM/P personnel has made it possible for them to be of material  assistance to many Ministries and Colonial Governments. In  recent months OM/P has directly assisted the following  organisations    a.  Far Eastern Bureau Ministry of Information  b.  Malayan Government -by originating and controlling  all morale propaganda undertaken during the Malayan  campaign  c.  Netherlands East Indies Government-by advising on  general propaganda  d.  Government of Burma -by advising on morale  propaganda and forming and controlling morale  organisations  e.  Government of China  f.  Hongkong Government  g.  United States and Philippines Government -by  providing guidance and a large amount of press  radio and other propaganda material for G.50 000.  Providing we are given permission to operate on the lines set  out in our cables 5b 57 and 58 and approved by you we    shall be the only British organisation still active in all  the Far Eastern countries. To make this possible our  Chinese allies have afforded us a degree of co-operation  unknown to other Ministries -Intelligence or Service organi    sations.    27.4.42, ...

THIS IS A COPY  ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED  IN CsEPiMwem UNDER SECTION  Mh Of 'jit PUBLIC RECORDS  ACT I9b t.   h1, THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT  RETAINED IN DEPARMENT  UNDER SECT ON 3 4 OF  THE PUBliC RECORDS  ACT 1958.,  S'     Gtto. bri.

[Please return it to 0  Section in due course.' It is presumed that 0.100 will bring his own copy.  This is a straightforward report of great expectations frustrated by  British official opposition and lack of imagination and preparation of careful  planning thrown out of gear by the time element and by great distances.    It is easy to be wise after the event but it is clear that the British  Colonial administration British officialdom in the Far East and the British  Secret Service had failed to make adequate preparations in time of peace for  internal organisation in war Fifth Column activities in enemy territory  communications and intelligence on anything approaching the scale accomplished  by Japan in the East. O.M. under 0.100's leadership set out to remedy these  deficiencies within a period determined by the outset of the war. He had only  seven months whereas he had hoped for twelve. Much of those seven months was  occupied in what might almost be described as a war of exgument against the  obstruction of more powerful and responsible British administrations and  officials. The area covered by 0.100's charter was so extensive that he failed  to cultivate more then a few plots of the field. If he were to succeed on the  large scale required by War itwas obvious that he could only achieve commensurate  results by training and using inconspicuous Asiatic agents. When it became  clear that the British Colonial administration and the British Army authorities  and the British Mi ister at Bangkok were not prepared to assist him and that  the only British official ally who believed in the possibilities of his mission  was Sir Archibald Clarke Kerr at Chungking it seems regrettable that 0.100 did    i N'y not concentrate on the Chinese. He spent a long time establishing his hesdquarters  at Singapore and did not visit Chungking until some precious months had  passed. He was handicapped by the arrangement with the Scandinavians and by the  V ' unconscionably long time that 0.700 and 0.701 took to get to Chungking. When   Vv''V/jJ 6 did get into his stride he met with inconceivable misfortunes. Sir Archibald   'v .A was transferred Sir Josiah Crosby virtually expelled his mission from Thailand  I i yy/. 1 twp weeks before war was declared the Free French organisation in Indo-China  LJf-t .1 / ' proved a broken reed and the ship placed at his disposal for communicating with     them proved unseaworthy. The Thilitary failed to give orders for demolition  in time and crowning misfortune failed to hold Singapore long enough to enable  his left-behind parties tooperate in favourable circumstances. Of the agencies  he established the one in Hongkong seems to have done very good work ofwhich  it would be interestingbo learn more details from 0.100. But the agents at    1  Hongkong and Shanghai seem to have been left by Mr. Jones without any instruc  tions whatsoever and it would be interesting to hear from 0.100 what opinion  he had of the results of Mr. Jones' activities. Had Mr. Jones been able to  start the agents he appointed to work he might have saved much time for 0.100  and possibly the unfortunate agents who have been imprisoned by the Japanese  in Shanghai might have been ableWachieve some results e.g. at the Kailan  Mines. 0.100 with the help of Sir George Sansom has a great achievement to  his credit in the record of the O.M. Propaganda Section. He has not advertised  his successes and I expect that he could point to a respectable list of  achievements by the trainees of the Scapula School in Malaya and Burma of which  we have had only piecemeal reports.    The record is one of enormous personal industry and effort in the most  difficult circumstances. The edifice he erected at Singapore was brought to  nought by our military and naval collapse. Had success attended the British  naval and military arms in the Far East 0.100 would doubtless have many more  successes to report. The story of our failure in Malaya is not one of the  failure of British Empire administration or of British industry or enterprise  or of British capacity to administer Asiatic territories in peace time. It is  a story of military ineptitude vae victisl O.M. was one of the victims.    Date.    No. .II., ftr so.  ri %    ku.F J tfi/aUlik.   &fy\/V7\fc W A/VC   gvuj .   /fyji hi Mt'yw Usi/ &.

Mission left London in April 1941 a statement was  left on record that in our opinion it would take at least a year to build up  a worthwhile organisation in the Far iSast -in making this statement we un  doubtedly underestimated the difficulties involved -political military  geographical and personnel. These difficulties were so great that I was  compelled seriously to consider whether in view of the virtual impossibility  of making adequate progress I was justified in continuing the effort and  expenditure involved in the attempt to set up the organization. In October  I submitted the case to the G.in.O. Far Hast and it was because we believed  tiiat in spite of the difficulties the establishment of the or aisation was  all important and because we were promised his full support I decided to  continue. K/L.6 took with him to London a copy of ay memorandum to the C.ln.C   Nevertheless in spite of all obstacles had we been given a year  instead of seven months before the outbreak of war in the Far Last an  effective organization should have been operating in certain areas although  not on the scale originally visualised. The organization in Free China  based on Chungking employing non-British Europeans and Chinese would have  oemmenoed operating. From the beginning assistance to Chinese Guerillas  based on our specialised experience had always offered the greatest scope for   S.O.S. in the Far East and was likely to make the largest single contribution  to our effort to hold the Japanese. Owing to no fault of hie we had to wait  four months for the arrival of the head of this organisation. Bat sen his  arrival in September and my visit to Chungking at the end of November all  preliminary negotiations had been satisfactorily concluded. The British  Ambassador and General Dennys had agreed to our proposals and Generalissimo  Chlang Kai Ghek had accepted our schame in principle and we were waiting only  for the arrival of his personal representative to discuss details. Thus when  0 113 arrived more or less simultaneously with General Chiang's representative  he was able to proceed with planning immediately. In addition to the above  we had agreed with General Dennys the immediate transfer of two squads of 304  Mission to 3.0 to commence operations immediately on the Indo China Yunnan  border. This latter arrangement with General Dennys was nullified by the  immediate outbreak of war.,  2-   The recant disbandment of tbs China Commando Group the reasons    for which are fully reported separately and are the direct result of the    military disasters which have befallen the Allies during the last five    months does not alter the facts as stated above although it represents a    serious set-back to our plans in the most important territory in the Far    Hast    The organization in Hongkong with the full support of the    G.O.C Hongkong was developing rapidly and extremely satisfactorily. All    credit should be given to the head of this organization. After his initial    appointment in February he was able to make no progress for the first few    months as he lacked a clear conception of what was required. It was not    until after his visit to Singapore early In July that he was able to commence    real planning and organizing. Given a few more months there is no doubt    that he would have been in a position to achieve valuable results in South    China and in fact his organization carried out effective work in the   l   defence of Hongkong though necessarily on a small scale both behind the    Japanese lines and in Hongkong itself.    Contact had been made with a French organization in Southern    Indo China and two visits had been paid to that country -the last by 0 105    in November. We had not at the time of the outbreak of war succeeded    in introducing stores and W/T into the country which was required to render    this organization effective nevertheless in spite of setbacks plans for    introducing such materials were being actively developed and were on the    point of being put into action. These plans had to be abandoned on the    outbreak of war and it became necessary to concentrate on an approach from    China. The delicacy of our position vis-a-vis the Free French and the    necessity necessity for observing the Decoux Agreement in spite of its    violation in many respects by the French in Indo China seriously handicapped    our activities. With the outbreak of war however and the arrival in    Singapore of a new and reliable military representative of the Free French    these latter difficulties were largely resolved. Iresent political con    ditions in China however are such that progress using that country as a    base is likely to be very slow and is even unlikely to be effective until    there is an improvement in the general military situation., -3-   ThQ opgaaiaation in Soutlier Thailand established to operate in  conjunction with Matador and to undertake tin denial in that territory  still needed Improved methods of communication but was nevertheless in a  position at the outbreak of war to take action. Owing to the fact how  ever that Matador was never put into operation as planned and that the  instructions to take aotion were issued some nine hours after instead of in  advance of the Japanese landings in Southern Thailand it is feared that our  personnel were rounded up before they could take effective action. Even so  most of the tin mines on the West coast of SouthernThailand could have been  at least partially denied had there not been a gap of two hours between the  receipt of Instructions frcm Corps H . to take action in accordance with the  modified Matador and instructions from the C.in.C. Far - ast himself to deny  the mines. Even if both instructions had been received simultaneously how  ever the full scale denial as planned could not have been carried out owing  to lack of time available. n general it may be said that the whole scheme    i.e. aotion in conjunction with Matador and Tin Denial failed primarily as  instructions were issued to us too late and because the military situation  was unsatisfactory.  In fact the deterioration of the military situation throughout  the Far East since Decanter 6th has militated against the success of any  S.O operations. There can be no real hopes of success until there are  definite signs not only that the Japanese have been held but are actually  being pushed back.    From the commencement it was felt to be too dangerous in view  of the delicacy of British relations with the U.S.A. to endeavour to do  more in the Philippines than encourage the direction of propaganda into  channels suitable to us making use of the strategic position of Manila  for broadcasting purposes. This work was most satisfactorily undertaken  by our representative in Manila who worked very harmoniously with C's  representative. A tentative approach to the American Military authorities    just before the outbreak of war to ascertain their reaction to planning  left-behing parties in the Philippines evoked an unsatisfactory response.    Progress in other territories i.e. M.E.I. Malaya Burma, Northern Thailand and Shanghai had at the time of the outbreak of war not  been satisfactory.    In general our plans in these territories were delayed and in  certain cases entirely frustrated owing to opposition both on political and  military grounds. This opposition depended upon the Individual reactions  of the personalities concerned. While no person could here been more help  ful than the Ambassador to China the Governor of Burma and the G.O.Q    Hong Hoag the attitudes of the Governor of Singapore the Minister to Thai  land the G O.Gs Malaya and Burma and C s representative in Shanghai  frustrated our efforts to establish organisations in Malaya Northern  Thailand Burma and Shanghai The opposition on political grounds was based  chiefly on the risk of endangering the British relations with other powers as  in Thailand and Shanghai or on the danger of undermining morale by teaching  urieixtals to anticipate an invasion from Japan Ws in Malaya and on  military grounds that our organisation would be competing with other military  organizations as la Buraia or would not be required as in Malaya That  this opposition was largely ill founded has been proved by events but so long  as we were bound by our charter not to take action scept with the agreement of  the authorities concerned it was impossible to make progress in their  territories. The difficulties we were experiencing were fully reported to  London at the time.    So far as the M S I were concerned progress was seriously  delayed by the reluctance of both the G.in.C. Far East and the G.in C China  to make any official approach to the Butch authorities owing to the delicacy  of British Dutch mutual relations finally a very tentative and apparently  satisfactory approach was made just before the outbreak of war as the result    of a visit from our representative on the invitation of the British Consul  General. Sven so no official approach was ever made to the Butch High  Command either before or after the establishment of General Wavell s Head  \1  quarters in Java.  It would not be out of place here to state that whereas under  the command of the C.ia.c. Far %at military opposition to 3 0 was based  generally on local considerations when General lavell assumed the Supreme  x  Command of the South West -Pacific and set up his head-quarters in Java the \   situation was    altered radically and for the worse. General Wave11 mad    no, 5    attempt to conooal his distrust of S 0.t baaed on his experience in the  Kiddle Hast and Brigadier Field who was appointed Ms liaison  Officer with S 0 fully supported the O.ln.O s yiewa. The situation in  Java whan 0.107 and I arrived vas thus made doubly difficult. Even so    gone progress was made in the very limited time at our dis osal with the  help of the Governor General s representative and four S/T sets were  handed over to the Dutch to be established and operated by them which  were intended to enable them to maintain secret contact with Colombo and  Australia through stations in Sumatra and Java in the event of the H. .X.  being occupied. It was also planned to maintain contact with the Chinese  OoffiEiuaists in Malaya through umetra. For reasons not yet known non o  the secret stations have yet established contact with Colombo or Australia.    In Malaya Burma Sorthern Thailand Shanghai not only was  progress unsatisfactory but our plans were largely or wholly frustrated.    First 1st it be understood that it was our policy to avoid  duplication of effort. Thus when m ascertained that the civil authorities  in Malaya were charged with the responsibility of denying tin rubber and  other properties likely to be of uss to the enoiay that the Havy had assumed  similar responsibility for the Oil properties in British Borneo that the  Military and Civil authorities were responsible for denial in Burma and that  the Dutch authorities had drawn up very complete schemes for the deatrution of  all oil and many other properties in the M.E.I. -it was clear that no useful  purpose could be served by our also endeavouring to tackle these objectives  and it should be clearly underst od that we were not responsible for denial or  destruction in Malaya Borneo Burma or H.l.I Nevertheless sf-ar the out  break of war we offered and gave all assistance possible when it was required  and our demolition parties were mainly responsible for the denial of the  Smelting Works in Penang the lower Station at Irai and the aerodrome at  Kuala Lumpur.    Our main concern in Malaya was to establish loft-bahind parties  to harass the Jap&nasa in ease of an invasion a tentative sc '.erne was drawn  up subject to revision in accordance with military requirements. The pro  posals were vetoed firstly by the C.in.G Far hast -and than after his  objections had been overcame by the Governor and the G.u.o. The Governor, would not agree to the training of Orientals in tin us of explosives    anai objected on the grounds of morale to any steps being taken whieh might    lead the people to believe that an invasion of Malaya by Japanese would be    more than very temporary The G.O.c. supported t e Governor and maintained    that left-behind parties would in any case prove impracticable and were un    neeoscary he did however support the format cm of parties to be left    behind for intelligence purposes only.    It was therefore not possible prior to t e outbreak of war to  lay on the organization we had planned although certain potential European  leaders had been tentatively selected. Immediately after the outbreak of  war the whole situation was radically altered and with the full consent of the  Governor and the G.O.C everything possible ..as done to organise train equip  and introduce parties -both European and Chinese to operate behind the  Japaneselines. However thelackoft±mavailableinwhichtoundertake  the organization and training the rapid retreat of the British forces and the  lack of previous preparation on the ground clearly diminished the effectiveness  of these parties. nevertheless it is confidently anticipated tnat the  Chinese Communist iarty which supplied the most promising Chines recruits for  the parties introduced will continue operations as long as possible and will be  available to stir up trouble both in Malaya and Singapore itself when offensive  action against M&laya becomes feasible. It was in fact confirmed by a report  received through one of our parties operating in Sumatra in February that  Caisffiunist Guerilla parties were then af1er the fall of Singapore operating on    '\    a considerable scale. The Xuo Ming Tang party supplied recruits for training    too late to be introduced behind the lines but some of them may also be avail  able to take action when the opportune moment cones. Political difficulties  between the Kuo Ming Tang and Communist Parties necessitate most careful and  separata handling of the two organizations.    Ho action was taken in British Borneo since before the outbreak of  war the vato of the Governor and the G.O.C applied and after the outbreak of war  all our energies were devoted to the most important end pressing task of s  organizing the left-behind parties in Malaya.    From B rma the Governor sent a representative to Slngar ore at the  end of May to discuss with us the desirability of setting up an organization in \, ills territory. This representative wiio was deputy to the Chief of the  Defence Bureau returned after his consultations with us and subsequently  reported that the Governor approved in principle the establishment of the  organization and had appointed him as head of it Although the general  lines onwhich the organiMtion should function had been discussed in  Singapore no progress was made with its establishment until 1 was able to  make my first visit to Rangoon at the beginning of August.    During the course of this visit the charter for the Burma organ  ization was drawn up and agreed both by the Governor a d the G.G.C. The  most important functions of the organization as agreed at this time were the  establishment of left-behind parties and the preparation of an organization  to undertake subversive activities across the border into Thailand to work in  conjunction with the organization which it was proposed to set up based on  Bangkok    Also the organization was to undertake the denial and destruction  of property likely to be of value to the Japanese in case of an invasion if  and to the extent required by the civil and military authorities was to act  as a supply base for China and was to undertake such underground propaganda  as might be required in agreement with the Governor.    In September the C.ln.C Far %st visited Burma and after  discussion with the 0.0.C. rilled that our organization should not undertake  the establishment of any left-behind parties in Buraia as the military had  other plans for th limited personnel European and native available.  Meanwhile also the responsibility for the denial and destruction of  property was definitely excluded frcan our charter as the civil and military  authorities had taken full responsibility. The subsequent failure just  prior to th outbreak of war of the organization based on Bangkokg to  materialise for reasons explained later made it necessary for t i Burma  organization to start entirely afresh in making contacts across the borders  of Thailand.    at the time therefore of the outbreak of war virtually no  organization existed In Burasa. Immediate steps were taken to endeavour to  improve th situation by transferring a section of the Singapore staff, to Ranjpon to aooalerate tim orgaaiAction ia Busan and to snleavour to  start to build up oonfcaots in Ttellwnd working frm Bumesa tarritory   Bvibaa iuantly following the change of coraaand in Burma the new  S 0 0 agreed in January IMS to the organization of native left-bsfclnd  parties in Burma on revoaed lines Barorfcunatsly this chang took place  too late to enable satisfactory arraugeioeats to be made in Bouchers Burma  whore til Japanese were already attaoking and the British troops retiring  A few smU. parties in Tsvoy under Suropean leadership were able to  remain behind the Jupamm advuao and undertake a United -mount of  denial an required by the raliitary authorities on the spot Berolopmenta  based on the re-organisation of native levies in the Southern sad Northern  Shan States and likely to be extended to the Assam border have ssade  oonsidereble progress and have been fully reported to London.   The feiluro of the cvgpalzation in Korthem Thailend based on  Baij cok was fully raported at the tiise uni th ecaount taken to London by  E/L.O In short H kf Uinister who bad after mch persuasion iirevioualy  agreod to the preparation of an or attination that would take so action  utilise and until his policy of conailiation had felled eudlonly without  warning and without enquiry went back on ell he had a -reed to vetoed the  whole of our cchono in a documsat largely notable for its inaccuracy and  advised the head of our or.-er.iration in B&artkok to putt. Unfortunately  the damge done by his action was irreparable as it took place barely three    weeks before the outbreak of war.  Similarly the difficulties which arose in Ohaag-a.1 and which  were never satisfactorily cleared up appeared to have developed frosa the  attitude of C s represoatative there who used his position as postbox to  interfere in our affairs. The culminating point cane when he took action  on his own initiatives certain of cur tdegreesc sent through hi to our  representative were apparently ndUcrepresented by bin to the Counsellor in  Shanghai who telegraphed to the Foreign Office and the Aiibasenior sn  incorrect version of our proposals. In spite of our representations aid.  t ose of the Ambassador the Foreign Office ultimately ruled against us  with the result that our organization was unable to sake any progress.  Owing to the time involved it was impossible before the outbreak of war to, visit Shanghai in order to resolve their difficulties.    Fro the moment of the outbreak of th Russo-German war it  appeared to ue extremely important to seize th opportunity to come to  some arrangement with Russia to establish a Mission in Siberia Had it  been possible to proceed with our plans important developiaeats might  have been possible in so far ae a Mission located in the -astern Siberian  Provinces would have had access to Manenuokuo and Japan denied to us in  Singapore Unfortunately however no progress was mad until just before  the outbreak of war when plans for an exchange of Missions with the Russians  were received from London. The collapse in the Far Sast appears to have  brought these proposals to a standstill for the time being.    As far a Japan and I anchuokuo were concerned and failing the  use of Siberia ae a base it was pit clear to us that the only progress  that could be made in these countries must b based upon Ohina. It ms  therefore necessary to await the establishment of the China organization  before contemplating the extension of our activities into Japan and  Manchuokuo. Nevertheless fully realising the vital ultimate importance of  being able to establish an organization to operate in Japan and Manchuokuo  we mad consistent but fruitless efforts to obtain staff of the right  calibre who had had recent experience in Japan and a thorough knowledge of  the Japanese language. Our applications to Sir Robert Craigie and the  Foreign Office to release certain Consular staff met with no success.    This failure on the part of the authorities to release good  men with experience of Japan and the J-panese language has proved lamentably  short-sighted and the outbreak of war found most of the good men with the  required qualifications in Japanese hands. Squally unsuccessful were our  efforts to obtain Japanese nationals willing to support the Allied cause  either In America Canada or China.    In general it may be said that the fact that our organization  in London was apparently unable to support us when important issues were  involved with the Foreign Office made it clear to us that we must rely  entirely on our own resources and that there was little hope of any  successful appeal to London against th views of the Foreign Office  repreeentatives in the Far Bast. It seemed therefore that even though, 10    the limitations placed on our activities under our charter mre in many    cases xcesaivly restrictive it would in practice he useless to attempt  to obtain a revision of the charter. Moreover in the country which  represented ultimately far and away the greatest scop for our  activities i.e. China the Ambassador's personal interest was such that  we were likely to receive far more help by dealing with him direct than by    entering into a long drawn out struggle with the Foreign Office to obtain    some modification of our charter.    While this apparent lack of support from London was in itself  very discouraging developments just before and following the outbreak of war  indicated a change of policy When the Mission left London it was clearly  understood that we would be responsible for developments on the spot in  agreement with the C.in.C. and civil and military authorities subject to  control of general policy from London. However towards the end of the  year it was apparent that this policy was undergoing vital changes and that  attempts were being made to control our executive activities from London.  Telegrams of instructions were sent which showed a lack of appreciation of  the situation in the Far East with the corollary that such instructions were  confusing and at times incapable of execution. Furthermore certain  telegrams were worded in a way that can only be described as insulting.    A most important principle is involved. In the conditions  existing in the Far East more particularly in view of the rapidly changing  military situation no Mission can operate successfully unless the head of it  is given the fullest possible discretion to formulate his plan in agreement  with the local authorities civil and military subject only to general  direction of policy from London and support from London when important  issues are at stake. I would not myself have accepted the position of head  of a Mission in the Far East on any other terms and this principle is equally  applicable to Missions in India China or elsewhere in the Far last.    It is unfortunate that A.D.O was unable to reach Singapore  as the result of the outbreak of war. I had hoped to come to an under  standing with him on this question but the outbreak of war not only  prevented ay discussions with him but also made it impossible to raise the    issues involved with London by telegraji., -11    It will be clear from the foregoing account that political and  military opposition to our plana made it impossible to employ Orientals in  our organization in most of the territories concerned. Consequently the  whole problem of training Orientals which we recognised to be of vital  important was solved only in part at the time of the outbreak of war. As  already explained we were not permitted to train Orientals in Malaya. The  military for reasons of security insisted that no Orientals should be  utilised in Southern Thailand in connection with Matador and in Bangkok our  abortive organization was unwilling to risk security and so would not agree to  the training of Orientals. In Burma a limited number only had been trained.    Nevertheless the whole basis of our scheme in China was the use of  Chinese both in China and outside so that incorporated in our proposals sub  mitted to and accepted by General Chiang were plans for training Orientals on  a considerable scale.    At the same ti e we had just before the outbreak of war and  before K/L.6 s arrival submitted a draft memorandum to G.H.4 emphasizing  the need for overcoming the various objections to the use of Orientals and  pointing out the necessity for training them for employment throughout our  territories. This memorandum was taken to London by K/L.6 in draft form.  It was never submitted to the C.in.C. in final farm owing to the outbreak  of war and the radical change in the situation arising from it.    In addition to opposition on political and military grounds    there were many other difficulties with which the organization had to contend    and which hindered progress.    The very limited number of British personnel available for all    purposes throughout the Far Sast was a very real handicap to the development    of our activities. The needs of the Army other Government services and    commerce left very few suitable personnel available for our requirements.    The need for secrecy militated against our recruiting openly in competition    with other organizations and we received only very little assistance in    personnel from the military Although most urgently required we were not    at any time able to obtain the services of an accountant for our organization    and the reluctance of the Ambassador in Tokyo end the Foreign Office to part    with any of the Japan Consular service has already been referred to. During,  IS tfc  first ttoee to four months la Singapore th skorta of women for  seoretarial and oiphar work also delayed our work. Although 0 s  representative during that period forwarded and received telegrams on  our account we had to provide the cipher staff who were compelled to  work in most uncomfortable and unsuitable circumstances with th result  that it was physically Impossible to telegraph on any matters other than  strictly day to day problems.    Th very great distances and the difficulties of transport  both of personnel and mil throughout the Far Sast caused considerable delays  a d in one important case prevented action. For instance it was not  possible at any time for any senior member of our staff to visit Shanghai  owing t the fact that the time required for travel alone would have been at  least fourweeks and thus itmsneverpossible toclearupon the spotthe  problems which had arisen there owing to th attitude adopted by O's  representative in that -ity    We were consistently hampered by th lack of adequate supplies  of stores. In spite of repeated requests w did not receive proper  advices of stores shipped. This experience I have found is not peculiar to  the Far East It was not until war broke out that sufficient supplies were  beginning to come forward. However as many ships were diverted to other  destinations it has been impossible to trace all our supplies even with the  full help and oo-ap ration of the Havy. Similarly we were constantly short  of h/u equipment and efforts made by London to obtain our views as to our  requirements at the earliest possible moment rare negatived by the fact that  our key /T personnel was not despatched until long after all other members  of the Mission.    One very important question of administration still remains un  settled and requires immediate attention. We have been unable to obtain any  clear direction as to the policy to be applied to the granting of Commissions  to staff and agents both British and non British or to the compensation of  non-coTsmicsionod European agents killed or injured in our service. In  particular the status of Scandinavians and Americans in our service in China  needs prompt settlement.    The question of security in Singapore the need for which was, very strongly emphasized before the Mission left London raised a number  of problems Whilst initially all possible measures to ensure security  were taken it soon became clear that security measures must be relaxed  if speed in setting up the organization was to be achieved. Cons neatly  during the two or three months previous to the outbreak of war the prob  lem was mainly one of compromise between the maintenance of security  particularly in the interests of our agents and the relaxation as far  as possible of all unnecessary restrictive measures in the interests of  speed. When finally war broke out the pretence of confining ourselves  to M.E.W. affairs in Singapore was almost entirely relaxed in order that  we might more openly co operate with the military in the preparation  training and equipment of the left behind parties.    The building up of our cover as M.E.W. Intelligence  necessitated a considerable amount of edonomic work and contact with  Government Departments throughout the Far East end with the Censorship  The work which had to be undertaken on this account was of value to the  organization but it nevertheless occupied much time of the staff in the  early stages.    Evidence of this may b found in the papers prepared by our  staff for presenting at the Economic Conference called by Mr. Duff  Cooper for December 8th These papers required long and oarafu  preparation but represented mainly mated effort owing to the outbreak of  war on the night preceding the day on which the Conference was to have  opened.    It should be clear from the above account that in the  circumstances the time at our disposal which proved in the event to be  seven months was quite insufficient for our purpose. Even in the most  favourable circumstances It would not have been possible to complete  the Organization in the period but a greater rate of progress might have  been achieved had wa received all round official support such support  would only have been forthcoming however with a complete and radical  change of outlook on the part of the majority of officials in the Far East  Such a change did manifest itself after the outbreak of war but alas too  late to affect the outcome Nevertheless in the short time available, 14    we were able to sake considerable progress in. Malaya and Buraia in  til organization of native resistance to Japan and to this  organization we must look for support when th tin canes for    offensive operations la those territories. The immadiate problem    is til need to establish and maintain contact but it csnnot be over    emphasized that no positive action can bo expected until the Japanese  advance is steaimed and the tide had definitely turned Of the  Oriental races in th Far East none excepting only certain elements  of the Chinese can be relied on to risk their lives in continued  resistance to a victorious Japan.    Future activity must b based on China Burma India and  Australia and if and when possible Siberia    In China as has been explained elsewhere the political  situation is such that no active co-operation from the Chinese in Kuo  Ming Tang territory can be exp cted until the tide of Japanese  successes has definitely turned. Meanwhile the China organization  must be prepared to lie low for the next few months being content at  present with planning action for the time when the situation improves  Future plans for China have been re orted separately. Immediate  attention should b given to the possibility of a direct approach to  the Chinese Gommunist Headquarters In North China Under no circum  stances however should th existing organization in Chungking be  oonneoted in any way with this approach.    In Burma th organization should function as long as  the military situation permits under th direction of India on t  lines which have been developed since its establishment as a separate  section. When th Burma organization is ooapslled to fell back on  India contact should be maintained with the Hill Tribe organization  on which they have been working.    The most important function of the India organization  so far as the Far Eastern territories are concerned is to endeavour t  re-establish contact with the Chinese Comuniat Party in Malaya with a  view to maintaining their support and introducing supplies for action  to be taken when the general situation has so improved that such action, say b ffactive Such coataot abcuM to r - tablisl5 d by land  through Bursa md Ttaailwnd and by coa through Sumatra in co-operation  with th Butch It is important that this work should b eo-ordioatod  with th plans of the Australian organisation In relation to th   The possibility of oraani lng Taail Estate labour in Malaya  should also b investigated in Southora India   India will aontlnua as long s possibl to give assistance  to China in matters of a teinistration rersonn supplies and  oaaaittmtcations   Until the scop of th proposed .Australian orgohiaation is known  it is not poE ible to define the extent to which this organisation should  cover the remining Far .Sastem territories. It is of i mediate importance  however that contact should be established in co operation with the Dutch  with Java and the Eastern Islands of the M lti Once this has been  achieved it nay be possible to plan action against the oilfields of Java  and later of Borneo. Staff of the Oil Companies capable of providing  all the information moemary is available in Australia .action against  Japanese shipping in H.8 X end South West Pacific waters my also be  possible using Australia ac a base.   If whan the Russians are willing to co-operate it is  important that a base should be established in Siberia from which It should  be possible to operate in iimobuokuo and Japan itself.   The work undertaken by the Mission on propaganda th scope of  which mB considerable and me developing very satisfactorily at th time  of the outbreak of war 1 the subject of a separate report   Finally I would like to record that apart from differences   of opinion on policy referred to above all authorities gave us every   possible assistance and that in particular C a representative in   Singapore ms most helpful   I am most grateful also to the staff of the Mission British   and Oriental who have storked loyally md unremittingly throughout la   spite of discomfort and danger., WT0 C. . through .D/U X/Ff/8.  FROM 0/X. 15.6.42.    I agree rith 0's soa eats.    'Ting to the progress of the war the o ly line of atieek on    F.I.C. would appe r to be through the Chinese provincer of Yunnan  Ks a.ngsi sad K angtung.  Logically F.I.C. should be the field fHotted to the Free    French who have been encouraged to o to Chun kin by us. From    Intercepts it seems that the Free French like thr Vichy French in    Chun.gkin and Kunming are more interested in playing politics with    the Chinese Government. It might be intimated to de Gaulle that if    he end Tuteages fail to produce r suit in F.I.C. within a reasonable    /time re might have to stimulate the Chinese to see -hat they could    dc in their own interests. Unfortunately we a.e net at present in    a position to help futenges materially t Chungking but le may be    in a position to do somethin about F.I.C. Iter ana the course of    the war may make decisive decision and action necessary. Obviously    if Tuteages and hi Free Fre ch are then in n position to show that    they con help materially thmunh their connections in F.I.C. which    they sboulu be preparing now the Free French would be in much    stronger position to claim an important role in the fight to free  'F.I.C. than i. they had no intern or enio ti n., COMMENT ON OM S REPCRT ON F.I.C    13.6.42.  1. The complaints of OM inactivity in the  PAR EAST reported to have been made by Admiral LAYTON  personally to A/D.5 seem to me irreconcilable with the  Admiral's excessive regard for the letter of the  DECOUX Agreement -no doubt one of OM's chief obstacles  see page 2.  2. It seems a pity that TUTENGES has not been    able to do more to establish contacts in French  military circles in F.I.C. see page 15. or to help    0.303 to smuggle in the W/T set via such contacts.  f, i'KiUsnA Aa   Tj vM Auv A  tY IT ojv A/   fifj'fa tyh .

AND FRMCH E 0 -CHINA  By the end of June 1941 0 M. were in a position to start  investigating the situation in F.I.C It was our hop that this country  would provide sone of the test opportunities for S.0 activities in the  Far East for these reasonsJ     a -Japan had acquired control over French territory as a  consequence of the fall of France and not toy direct conquest.  The French in F.I.C. had no reason to respect the Japanese  and had little fear of them and it was expected to be easy to  find Frenchmen who would work against them even if compelled  to support Vichy in Europe.   to -Any Frenchman would prefer European control of the Far East  to domination by Japan and might be expected to work against  Japan to this end. With a British victory they could hope to  keep their jobs in F.I.C. Unless the Japanese were removed  they could not.   c -By the nature of the Japanese occupation of F.I.C. they were   protectors of the French and had therefore to give them a  large measure of freedom. This was likely to continue Sven if  the Japanese became involved in war.  The above it was hoped would be good foundations for S.0.   agents to operate.    1. POLITICAL BACKGROUND.  THE DECDUX AgREEHHMT.  This agreement known to the French and elsewhere as the   Singapore agreement had been signed on Feb 15th 1941 between Admiral  Deooux Governor-General of F.I.C. and Admiral Layton C.in.C. China  for the Governor of Malaya. It was designed primarily to restrict the  movements of the French naval vessels and principal merchantmen in Far  Eastern waters and so to relieve the Royal Navy of the need to convoy  Allied vessels on the Singapore-Hongkong run.    The C.in.C China set a high value on this clause.  Under subsidiary clauses in the agreement the British under, took to restrain the Free French from activities in. F.I.G. itself. In  exchange the French undertook to curb anti-British propaganda in F.I.G.    The existence of this agreement was a constant obstacle and j  embarrassment to O.M. So anxious was the O.in.C China to have it  maintained that the French were allowed to perpetrate flagrant breaches  of the agreement without serious objections from Singapore. Apart from  violations of the shipping clauses the French grew increasingly abusive  both in the F.I.C. press and over Radio Saigon while any attempt at  retaliation which would have provided 0.M with propaganda opportunities  and would have been exploited at once from Singapore was checked by the  Ministry of Information at the C.in.C. China s instructions. It was only  towards the end of lloveaber 1941 that the latter s patience became ex  hausted and greater freedom of speech allowed. In effect the agreement led  to the impossible situation of the Free French not being allowed to operate  directly in F.I.C affairs. Indirectly we were able to use them as ex  plained below    2. THE VICHY CONGOLATl E SINGAPORE.  Particular care had to be taken to ensure security in O.M.  plans for an F.I.C organisation and in our dealings with the Free French  on account of the presence of a Vichy Consul-General in Singapore    M. Pingaud who had complete freedom and diplomatic immunity. There was  evidence of his misusing consular bag privileges and on one occasion the  Free French intercepted a safe hand letter addressed to him from the Vichy  Consul-General in Batavia which contained German espionage material. The  experts at the llaval Base were never able to crack his high-grade cyphers  in Singapore and the volume of his cypher traffic was too great for us to  ask for it to be submitted to London for analysis. We believe however  from personal contacts arising out of Economic matters referred to below  that M. Pingaud never became aware whence O.M s activities were directed.  3. FREE FRENCH IN SINGAPORE.  The FarbEastern Headquarters of the Free French was established  in Singapore under M. Baron who had previously been a Government servant  at Champadanga French India His personality lacked the qualities of  leadership and the Free French of Malaya and the British had little con, 3    fideaoe in him. Moreover the potential value of this organization was    seriously restricted by the Decoux Agreement and as far as F.I.C. was    concerned they were only able to provide material and personnel for  broadcasts from Singapore.    The bulk of this work was done by 0.300. He had left  Indo-China early in 1941 where for some years he had been a practising  surgeon and Professor of the College of Medicine at Hanoi. He had a  wide acquaintance of political personalities in F.I.C. h'hen in Hew York  he had made contact with the S.O. organization and had been sent by them  to Singapore to await the arrival of O.M. For security reasons O.M. did  not at first deal with him directly.    Apart from broadcasting the Free French in Singapore were  chiefly concerned with recruiting for de Gaulle drawing in men from  Shanghai and smaller Sastsrn French communities and from the crews of  French ships deserting in Dutch Ports and Manila. These men were in  general sent to the Free French forces in the Hear East.    O.M. did not disclose their proposals to the Free French  at this stage and whatever negotiations were required were handled by  0.302 who had been Liaison Officer between the Free French and the C.in.C  China since December 1940 with him O.K. soon established close relations  and his intimate knowledge of French character and personalities was  invaluable.  4. FREE imiCHMEa IH MALAYA.  Through 0.302 wqiearned that there were amongst the Free  Frenchman in Malaya a number of sen who were extremely keen to undertake  snore active duties. The head of the Free French organisation in Malaya     as opposed to the Free French Far Eastern Headquarters in Singapore who  was the chief of these men later joined Q.M. as 0 303.     established indirect contact with him and asked him  to nominate a number of men who could be available for F.I.C. operations.  Some men mainly his colleagues from spin Estates near MALA L0KHJR were  sent to the school of Demolitions then newly established in Singapore and  given a full training course at the end of July. It was expected that any    operations conducted in F.I.C. in peace time would be best undertaken by, Frenchmen and th se men after training returned to their normal duties   and to stand by on call for any operations required.   At this  stage the O.M. central organisation was kept secret   from all the Free French   5. FHI3IGH ATTITUDE IN IM 0 GHim.  Our sources of information on the sentiments of the French in   Indo-China were     a  -Visiting journalists. These were rare but in particular valuable  information was supplied by Mr. Delby-Walker of Reuters and by  Mr. Jack Shepherd who later joined Q.M staff.   b  -Visiting business men. These were also very few and had less  freedom of movement in F.I.G. if they were not to attract attention.  Our chief informant 0.301 later Joined us as mentioned below.   c  -The crews of French ships. On the Saigon-Manila- Shanghai run in  particular a number of sailors who for family reasons could not  openly come over to ne Gaulle used to carry messages via.  M. Wllloquet an ex-French Consul-General in Manila these reached  us in Singapore via. the Free French.  Through  these channels we learneds    1   That the French Military in F.I.G. who strongly resented their  enforced subraission of the Japanese particularly since the Langson  affair in July 1940 and who were emasculated by the Japanese  Military occupation of F.I.C. formed a hopeful material for a  possible revolt against the existing French administration and  against the Japanese especially in the north provided that  adequate material support could be given.   il -That the French Navy were solidly behind Admiral Decoux the  Governor-General and had turned thoroughly anti-British after Oran  and Dakar.    lii  All visitors supported the view generally held in the East that the  bulk of the French in F.I.O. particularly the Government officials  were corrupt indolent and interested in their jobs only in so far  as was necessary to secure their pensions. Opium smoking Is  widespread amongst them    iv  That there was nevertheless in existence in the south a selfappointed  body of Frenchmen under the leadership of 0.3000  organised to supply intelligence and to commit acts of sabotage  both exclusively against the Japanese.  6.  0.3000 ORGANIZATION.  We were  informed that this consisted of some 300 men divided   into cells of about 6 men each and designed each to operate independently.   They were drawn mainly from the lower ranks of French civilian residents.   They were strong in Baigon and in the lesser towns of Cambodia and Cochin   China In the plantations and in frontier posts.   On thi intelligence side they were already operating and had, b   already been sending out a number of reports on Japanese dispositions  and descriptions of Japanese equipment etc These had been sent to the  Free French some via. Uanila in the care of sailors on the Messageriea  Maritimes boats and some on microfilm smuggled by Asiatics on the direct  boats to Shanghai.    7. CONTACT WITH THE Q.SOOO ORGANIZATION.  This organization clearly required full investigation with  a view to O.M. giving it support if found worthy. Our chief fear was that  of its security for the communications sent out via. the somewhat un  reliable M. Willoquet in Manila could not be regarded as safe and the tone  of the reports suggested that they were making strenuous efforts to  advertise themselves with a view to getting recognition and support.    It was therefore decided to send in one or more agents to  F.I.C. to see 0.5000 and his men and if they were found satisfactory to  arrange to help and supply them.     a  -Use of Asiatics.  The possibilities of establishing Asiatic contacts with  F.I.C. were also examined by O.M. and it was hoped that something might be  done through the large Chinese merchant community in Cholon Saigon .  Initially however we concentrated on French contacts as we held that  European leadership was essential and that it was better the French should  be free to select Asiatic operators themselves where it might be desirable  to use them.  8. VISIT OF 0.303 and 0.301  0.303 volunteered to visit F.I.C. to make this investigation.  Being so prominent a man in Malaya it was necessary to take exceptional  precautions to prepare his cover and to obtain his papers. We described  him as a British Merchant ordered to visit F.I.C. We found a man of about  the same size and colouring to impersonate him at the French Consulate who  granted a visa and then exchanged the photographs.  0.301 was the manager of certain French Rubber Estates in  Cochin China and was on a visit to Singapore.

Both the above left Sln e-nore fm v.T.n. owiOw in, -in   0.303 road his visit without a hitch. He was able to  make all necessary contacts and as far as we know aroused no suspicions  whatever. 0.301 however owing to certain indesorotions  was asked on his departure from Saigon  not to return to JT.l.G.   On their return they reported Jointly as follows     a  -That the 0.3000 organisation existed much as they had already  described themselves to the Free krench.   b  -That their security was good and that they were not known either  to the French Police or to the Japanese.   o  -That provisional arrangements had been made to receive our  proposed expedition which we were prepared to despatch from  Singapore and which was to provide them with a radio set with  a trained operator and a substantial assortment of arms ex  plosives and devices with a trained instructor. The date for  this expedition was fixed by all partiee concerned in F.I.C. as  October 24th i.e. the first new moon after the return of the  above two men. The landing place was selected namely a stretch  of open beach at Thuan Men on the S.iS. coast of Cochin China  between Cap St. Jacques and Xega Point where a jungle track ran  down to the sea. 0.303 0.301 0.3000 and 0.3100 the latter  0.3000 s right-hand man had visited the spot had bathed there  and sounded the approaches and found it in every way satisfactory  provided the operation was undertaken before the break in the K.E.  Konsoon in November.  9.  FLATOIINC OFFICE.  Shortly after his return from F.I.C 0.301 joined O.U. staff and  he and 0.300 were established in an office where they were able to conduct  the planning of F.I.C. proposals. This office was separate from O.M. main  offices but was in close touoh.    After 0.303 s return from F.I.C. we disclosed the O.H.  organisation and thereafter met him whenever necessary at the above office.  We had no open association with any of the shove staff.  1°. THE WAN TOM' EXPEDITION.   All efforts were concentrated on equipping the expedition for the \  landing mentioned above. Negotiations were opened with the Navy throt  Captain J.A. Collins R.A.N. C.B. and it was established that under con  ditions of neutrality a naval vessel could not be used. A suitable  vessel a salvage tug on naval service was put at our disposal. Withih\  a week of the sailing date however Naval orders demanded that this ship N  was withdrawn and we were offered an alternative ship the S.S WAN YUW, 7    an Upper Yangtse river teaser of about 350 tons. We had perforce to  accept this ship although she was much less suited to the operation not  being a sea-going boat and having a civilian captain and crew from whoa  the exact nature of the operation had at first to be kept secret for  reasons of security ashore.    The operation was planned in the most minute detail. The ship  was to be ostensibly on a voyage to Hongkong and was to return on receipt  of orders at sea. About 15 cwt. of stores and a Mark III radio were  stowed under a load of coal in the hold. A specially silenced motorboat  was prepared to go into shallow water inshore. Two Frenchmen in the party  wore to go ashore first in a rubber boat to reconnoitre and contact the  0.3000 gang who would be waiting on shore. In case of surprise on shore  the party would shoot their way out but would not otherwise use firearms.  The 0.3000 gang would take away stores and personnel in their own motor  transport. It was the intention to repeat the operation at monthly  intervals subsequently with larger quantities of material using the same  stretch of coast in the S.tt Monsoon and the beaches or islands of the S.W.  coast of Cambodia in the N E. Monsoon.    The personnel of the expedition were in addition to the  ship s complement    0 508 in Command.    0.505 as xtirelesa operator on board.    0.507  Sergeant white of Scapula.  0.300 for conference on shore.  0.3120 radio operator fully trained at Scapula.  0.3130 demolition instructor trained at scapula.  The WAN 1UENW sailed from the school of Demolitions on the  morning of October 19th.    On October 33nd a telegram ms received in clear addressed  to a member of the Free French staff in Singapore reading translated   MARKET AT PRESENT VERY MiOHDUS CANCEL ORDER HP .  This message was at once put on the air in cypher to the     WAN YUEN together with orders to return forthwith and work out an, -8    immediate alternative plan. In spite of all efforts no answering signal  was received from the shipm and to ensuro that the ship did not proceed  into what might be a trap a Catalina aircraft was sent out with L/FE  aboard to search the area in Aich it was calculated that the ship should  be. No contact was made but shortly before the aircraft returned a weak    signal was received from the ship which had in fact already received the    earlier signals and had turned back. It appeared that on account of the    short roasts of so small a ship satisfactory radio contact had been    unexpectedly difficult. The WAN YUEN duly returned to Singapore on    October 29th.    We immediately made plans for repeating the expedition within    the week before the moon became too high at a different point on the    coast. These ideas had to be abandoned for several reasonsi     a  -The Ships Captain threw in his hand and his native crew  refused to go to sea again having learned the nature  of the expedition after they had first left Singapore.   b  -The ship had' had a rough passage and it was doubtful if  she was seaworthy under the advanced N.E. Monsoon conditions  which were thonerident in Singapore.   a  -It would have been necessary to land blind on an unknown  coastline whence it was by no means certain that O.SOOO s  men would be able afterwards to recover the stores.  Wo were very strongly advised by our shipping expert     0.215 against attempting the expedition in these circumstances and most  reluctantly abandoned the attempt.  n.  EooNamo Yisrr to f.i.c.  It was necessary to ascertain exactly why 0.3000 had had to    call the party off and also most essential to get at least the radio set    and operator into F.I.C. as quickly as possible.    It was decided therefore that 0.105 should go over to    F.I.C. openly on the pretext of negotiating with the French for relaxing  of the virtual embargo on British imports into F I.C. in exchange for  increased French shipments of coal and cement to Malaya. The proposal  was agreed to by the C.in.O. China and put up by him through the Acting  British Consul-General in Saigon to the French who accepted., THIS SS A COPY   ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED  IN OEPARMENT UNDER SECTION  3 4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS   7 e were noTertholeoa oomitted  ACT 1958.   to the Economic diocuoaions and it was doairablo that 0 105 make the visit  for the purpoBoa of O.U. Accordingly ho went over on November 4th   0.3130 the trainod radio operator also cam over in the  same ship posing as a Frenchman diBsatisfiod with work in British  territory and anxious to rejoin his own countrymen. He had no difficulty  in entering F.I.C   The buhk of 0.105 s visit had to bo devoted to discussions  with the French Bureau Eoonoml iue on details of the proposed trade agree  ment. There was however ample opportunity to sound out French senti  ment in general and to see in person on several occasions 0 3200 one of   0.3000 a three ringleaders. The results of this survey wore not   I .'  encouraging.   0.6000 b ambitions wore known to far .too many people -in  fact to every Englishman spoken to In Saigon. It seemed inevitable that  in spite of 0.303 b and 0.301 s previous assurances the organisation must  have boon known to the Suroto. It soemed most probable that French  officialdom waa prepared to turn a blind eye upon 0.3000 so long as he  remained harmless but it was moat unlikely that under pressure from   the Japanese they could afford to ignore him if he started specific acts  of sabotage .   In addition a most unfavourable impression was created by  0.3200. Ho was obviously in a state of extreme nervousness at the prospect  of undertaking any operations yet at the same time was quite reckless in  his disregard of security. It transpired on this visit confirming   secret reports already received that on the occasion of the WAN TOEN S  proposed secret landing the Japanese had patrols along the road behind  this stretch of coast and had a picket and a gun emplacement at the point  selected for the landing. This area was not normally patrolled nor was  the point a likely one for defence works. CSdbse'qUbmi i bedhm'e -'known,  10    that the proposals for the expedition had been widely discussed as far  reasonable  afield as Shanghai in French circles . The inference was beyond/doubt  that the plan had reached Japanese ears.  At that particular time i.e. the latter half of November 1941  circumstances were undoubtedly most unfavourable for any Frenchmen to  attempt to work in any way for the British. The Japanese were coming into  Saigon in large numbers and were making obvious preparations for immediate  war. Although they scarcely interfered in any way with French life the  French could not be blind to their potential power.  Of more immediate consequence however was the stiffening of    7.I.C. Government measures against any Frenchman who displayed pro-Allied  sentiments. The police in Saigon were adopting Gestapo methods.  Listeners to foreign broadcasts had been imprisoned. The climax was  reached on about Ilov. 10th when the Manager of the Messageries Maritimes  one of the most prominent citizens in Saigon was detained for alleged  abuse of censorship in sending letters out with ship s officers. In  addition over one hundred minor Government Officials had been discharged  for alleged Free French sympathies.  These difficulties were discussed with 0.303 on 0.105 s  return to Singapore. He agreed that 0.3000 s organisation as a whole was  in danger but he insisted nevertheless from his own more intimate  contacts that we would still find individuals associated with Huchet who  could be trusted for security and who would continue to plan working with  us in spite of the above difficulties. In particular he had complete  faith in 0.3100.    12. 0.300 S VISIT TO THIS NORTH.  During this time O.M. plans for contacting F.I.C. from the  North had taken shape. The attractiveness of the Northern approach to    F.I.C. were   a  -Possibilities of contacting high French Army  Officers whose headquarters were at Hanoi.   b  -Exploiting the greater freedom of Trade and  coaununications from Hongkong Macao and ISmng Chow .San  with Haiphong.   c  -Opportunities for extensive use of Chinese who could  much more readily be used to undertake smuggling on  our behalf.  As against the above the South provided the most important, 11    S 0. Targets and as we then still hoped there would be a workable S.O.    organization in the country. Approach to these via. the North was most    cumbersoHis. however. Accordingly shortly after the failure of the     Wan Yuen expedition 0.300 was sent to establish contacts particularly    for smuggling in the above Northern ports. 0.302 who was in any case    visiting Hongkong for the Free French prepared the way for 0.300 s visit.    0.300 also made arrangements see below in Manila en route. He travelled  as a French Canadian journalist. He had considerable saceess both in  Hongkong and in Macao where he set up a Trading Company in the name of  0.3500 an agent resident in the F.I.C. and who was free to travel regularly  in the course of his normal business from F.I.C. to the above ports and  whose wife remained in Hongkong to handle special 0 M. stores which would  be disguised in legitimate cargo.  Unfortunately the Far Eastern war broke out within a fortnight of  these arrangements being concluded. 0.300 only got back to Singapore with  difficulty and owing to loss of contact with Hongkong shipments of stores  could never be started.  13 APPROACHES BY CHINA.    He had also had in mind the importance and possible necessity in  case of war of having a line of approach to F.I.C. overland from Burma or  China. Surveys of the Burma-2 .I.C. Frontier only served to confirm our view  that this approach was virtually impracticable in view of the difficult  terrain. The rarity of tracks made security almost impossiblem as every  thing would be known to the natives en route.    The China Yunnan -F.I.G. Frontier was however more promising.  There had been regular desertions of French. Officers from the Vichy forces in  Tonkin the men coming over this Frontier and down into Burma to join the  Free French. These officers gave valuab e information on the possibilities  of working these routes the other way.    Accordingly it was decided to send an agent into Yunnan to work on  the contacts over the Border. 0.304 colleague of 0.303 was first  selected for this Mission. He had scarcely started however when the  outbreak of war altered the picture. see below ., -IS    SMUGGLING    After the failure of the .v'an Yuen expedition we turned our  attention more actively to other methods of introducing stores and particular  ly the first radio set into F.I C Some form of smuggling was the obvious  alternative and we concentrated on working up possibilities having in mind     a  -The regular fortnightly service of steamships  from Singapore to Saigon.   b  -The native junk trade in dried fish from the  Cambodian coast to Singapore.   c -  Smuggling over the Thai border.   d -  Smuggling from Hongkong and Macao as above.  On socaminihg the Ships manifests under a it was envious  that smuggling wag already in progress on a fair scale. Cautious  approaches were made to the Chinese firms concerned but this took time and  the outbreak of war intervened before any workable proposition had been  beached.    A long and patient approach to fishing boat owners was unfruit  ful though we had some hopes of success had there been more time.    Plans for snuggling over the Thai border were preceding well  using a Bangkok gangster known to C s organisation and certain reliable  french Frontier officers who were in 0.3000 s organisation. This was  however out short by the attack on Thailand.    During this ti e an experimental Department had been set up at  scapula for packing stores in apparently innocent coraaereial packages. The  packages finally selected for the radio equipment were barrels of Australian  wine in which there had developed by then a fair trade with F.X.C. The  Kadio equipment was sealed and suspended in the middle of the barrel which  was then filled up with wine. We expected that no Frenchman would empty the  contents of a barrel of so scarce a commodity on suspicion of smuggling.    Other possible cargoes for smuggling which we investigated  ttere bags of produce especially onions and betel nuts inwhich there was a  large trade bales of tobacco and cases of canned goods.    All smuggling plans for the South ran up against the same  obstacle namely that no one in Saigon dared to risk handling the special  goods. The Tobacco Companies were in any case too closely watched by the, Excise-men. For others it v ould have been necessary to find an agent    established in his particular business as it was virtually impossible    for any newcomer to enter a standard business in aaigon in time of    acute shortage of imports. During 0.105 s visit it was hoped suitable    consignees would be found amongst some of 0.3000 s gang who were    employed in Merchant firms. However none would face the risk. We    had not resolved these difficulties when war broke out in the Far East.    15 PROPAGMDA.    During this period 0 M. were through the M.O. and through    0.300 and 0.30S in close touch with the French broadcast programmes from  Singapore. This was at first our only channel for reaching the French  in F.I.C. with propaganda which dealt with their particular problems but  we were doubly handicapped in that we had to rely solely on the lowpowered  Singapore transmitter which was heavily jammed by the French in  Saigon and Hanoi and that outspoken subject matter brought iamediate  protests from Admiral Decoux. For the sake of the agreement these  protests were respected in spite of the violent anti-British propaganda  appearing in the F.I.C. Press and to some extent on the air from  Radio Saigon. To overcome these difficulties we planned to put out  similar broadcast material simultaneously from Manila and the M.E.I.  Station Hirorn on 4 wavelengths as well as from Singapore s 3 wavelengths  We hoped later to bring in also Hongkong Rangoon and Chungking and  possibly India.  0.302 visited Java and made the preparation for the NIROM  broadcasts. The arrangement was that they should make a record of his  daily Singapore broadcast which was to be flown over by the daily KNUM  service to Batavia and put on the air from NIR0M the following day. The  Initiation of this service gave rise to a number of petty difficulties  largely arising out of individual jealousies and excessive caution in the  Dutch censorship which were never satisfactorily resolved. Pressure of  other work did not permit the repetition of visits necessary to clean up  0.300 paid a visit to Manila and was able to arrange for  mV    an allocation of suitable time on one of the two Manila broadcasting v  stations. It was necessary to find a broadcaster of sufficient, -14    intelligence and culture to prepare and broadcast suitable propaganda    from a general directive which were to be sent from Singapore by air    mail and from listening to the Singapore French material. 0.300    nominated for this purpose a Frenchwoman of his acquaintance     Thae. sohlepianoff who was then in Shanghai. There followed long and    excessively tiresome delays in getting her granted the necessary papers    to enter reside in and take employraent in the Philippine Islands.    She finally reached Hongkong en route to Manila only after the outbreak of    war and we lost touch vfllth her. It is feared she was trapped in Hongkong.    JmmjTE BROADCASTS    Arrangements were made for a weekly broadcast in Annamite from  Singapore. There was considerable difficulty in finding an Annamite to go  on the air as the few Annamites in Malaya were in a close guild which was  under the thumb of the Vichy Consul s Asiatic staff whose threats of  retaliation against families in F.I.C. frightened off the only possible  broadcasters.    This was solved by finding an Annamite up-country who  periodically made a secret journey to Singapore and prepared a gramophone  record of his broadcast which only went on the air after he had left  Singapore.  16 PRINTED PROPAGANDA.    0.M s Singapore propaganda organization was in a position to  produce leaflets early in October and a fair amount of material was prepared  to be taken into F.I.C. by the Wan Yuen expedition. This included  cartoons specially prepared in Singapore with Annamite captions on the  principal theme that The Japanese eat rice but the French eat wheat .  inferring that the Japanese occupation of F.I.C. would prove to be at the  expense of the Annamites staple food supply. A number of British carlfons  were also copied with French captions.    17. O.M. RELATIONS WITH THE FREE FRENCH.  As mentioned above O.M. had close relations with certain of  the Free French notably 0.303 and 0.300 and with 0.30S who worked in the  Free French Office but we kept the nature of our main activities secret  from M. Baron and his immediate subordinates., -IS -   In the early stages of developing our plans we were able to main   ....   tain this false position chiefly owing to the indolence and lack of  Initiative or ambition displayed by M. Baron. Matters came to a head how  ever when in August M. Baron declared his Intention of proceeding to  Cairo to report to G-en. de Gaulle. It was inevitable that M. Baron would  either report whatever he knew of O.M s activities or more likely as he  knew little or nothing of these he would be ordered by de Gaulle to adopt  a more active policy towards F.I.S this on account of the Decoux agreement  would have to be underground and so would directly conflict with G.M.    This problem was put up to S.O.E. for guidance but we were  instructed still not to disclose to Gen. de Gaulle our F.I.C. plans.  Actually M. Baron failed to make this journey and this crisis was deferred.    Matters soon came to a head again however for presumably  de Gaulle was still dissatisfied at the apparent inactivity of his Far Eastern  representatives. We were informed that a mission was to be sent to  Singapore under Commandant Tutenges and that this would be particularly  concerned with F.I.C. It was obvious that however much we may have been  able to fool Baron we should not attempt to foil Tutenges. He vias  fortunately reported to be a man of high character who had already had  dealings in S.O. affairs in West Africa. It was decided therefore to  offer to co-operate fully with the Free French when he arrived. With this  the C.in.C. China agreed.    Our negotiations with Tutenges were entirely satisfactory. It  was agreed that in principle O.M. would continue to handle civilian contacts  in F.I.C. and that Tutenges with a staff of Free French Officers would set  about establishing contacts in French Military circles in F.I.C.  18 TRANSFER OF DIRECTI l The situation in Malaya was now such  that the centre of activities had to be transferred nearer to the Chinese  frontier of F.I.C. which was proved the only rout of physical contact.    Accordingly 0.301 was sent to Yunnan to set up an office in  Kunming whence it was hoped he would be able to afford assistance to any  agents British or Free French whomwe might wish to send to the Frontier.    Comdt. Tutenges also transferred his headquarters to Rangoon    and later to China, -16    0.503 8 SECOND JOUHIgY 0.303 being throughout oommiced of the  integrity of 0.3100 and certain others of 0 3000 8 associated then  strongly urgod that h should go again into F.l.C. taking the radio  equipment. Ee volunteered to make a parachute descent if necessary.    This proposition ms fully explored with the assistance of  0/0 Brown 0/C of the Heoonnaissanc Group of the R.A.I . in Singapore. It  became evident that     a  a night landing by Catalineoon the Mekong would be  unjustifiable owing to the risk from floating snags  and fishing stakes.   b  That a parachute descent would run a big risk of failure   1  -Owing to the probability of smashing the radio  having no special packing at our disposal   2  -If the drop were made in open country there was every  chance of the affair being seen and reported by  natives.   3  -If in unpopulated country there was little chance  of the equipment over being found.  In addition %e the O.in.C F.B. was anxious for the safety of  the few Gatalinas at his disposal and risks to an aircraft in this  operation would have been considerable as it would have been necessary to  go at least 100 miles inland. This scheme was therefore abandoned.  It was agreed that 0.303 should adopt the slower but probably  far mors certain approach from China. Ee therefore left Singapore for  Kunming travelling on a British passport and taking with him the complete  radio equipment and ms accompanied by 0 3130.

SXm4P0RE RECORDS     dmwmk%LM . u tefea    X left Singapore in the Empire Star which sailed  shortly after dawn on Thursday February 12th. On the previous  day she had taicen on board some two hundred women and children and  about eight to ten hundred air force personnel and a few men from  other units. mills lying at the wharf on the Wednesday she was  incessantly bombed and large fires were started in adjacent godowns  making It impossible to go ashore. Anti aircraft fire from the  local defences kept the attackers at a high level and though bombs  fall very close to us we were not hit.    All the women were accommodated in twelve cabins  and the saloon under the bridge while the rest had to find what  room they could on the decks and in the holds. I put on board two  of our Secretaries who had stayed to the end. One of the-' had two  young children and her mother with her. They both behaved well  and helped those others of their sex into the limited space with  them.    On the Tuesday in the forenoon I had taken on board  some forty pieces of baggage belonging to members of the staff  already evacuated. It promised to be no easy job with no dock  labour no stevedores and no winches working. But having managed  to keep together a few coolies and a hired lurry we humped the  stuff up and X then set a winch going for the heavier stuff. At  this stage one of the ship s engineers gave a hand. Bis help was  given because he didn't mind helping those who did something for  themselves -not like those bloody soldiers who expect everything  done for them .    As I had been told on board that the ship would be  short of water and was not victualled for so many I sent on board  care of the Chief Officer a quantity of aerated waters. This  secured me a place on the floor of Ms cabin for me a most  valuable and acceptable act of hospitality as I had to care for  four bags of confidential mail codes and ciphers each of which  weighed from thirty to forty pounds. This exacting and very  literally onerous burden rendered it impossible for me to bring all  my own effects and many other odds and ends that might otherwise  have been saved. The threatened food shortage was averted by  unofficial action by the troops who on hearing of the absence of  loaves and fishes in our larder saved from the flames or fro  Japanese looting part of the contents of an adjacent godown.    At about six o clock on the evening of the eleventh  we drew away from the wharf and anchored just outside the harbour  where wa were to pick up next day some other ships and an escort.    We sailed at dawn on the twelfth ahead of the other ships and at  nine o clock werG attacked by a fleet of nine dive bombers who, THKM8AG0PY  ORIGINAL QOOum Ng§  IN OEPARMEnt UNOE .    Lf m  3 4 OP fMfe pyi& ic. rigOORfiG  ACT 1938.   Page 2.    continued their attacks upon our ship until one o clock A  largwr number of heavy bombers attacked from a higher level. At  first we started well bringing down one of the dive bombers and  winging another which disappeared In Its own smoke screen. Then  our anti aircraft gun was hit and put out of action and its crew  killed. This spoilt our interest in the fight as we had only  passive defence to rely on. Two more hits on the ship did a bit  of damage and caused casualties but did not impede the ship s    progress. The Master handled the ship with great skill and by  making sharp turns at the right time saved us from many hits and  the ship from being sunk.    By the beginning of January the bombing of Singapore  had become a daily routine and by the middle of the month these  Japanese activities had dislocated the normal work of the port  and of all offices. Alerts and danger periods meant an increasing  waste of time. If we had to go out on an errand -to the hank to  make a business call -it meant almost certainly that most of tke  forenoon would be taken up with that one item.    In spite of this the volume of our routine office  work increased -ana in January our telegraphic traffic in and  outwards was as high as It had ever been. The depletion of the  staff by evacuation rendered it all the harder to cope with the  influx into our office of Scapula military and so on. And the  reduced number of competent office workers had even more work than  before to cope with so far as concerned the endeavour to maintain  orderly methods and procedure.    f/hen it came to getting out our staff and effects it  became apparent that our relations with the Military Authorities  controlling merchant shipping had not in the first instance been  established on a sufficiently high plane. And it was too much  left to successful personal relations with sub-ordinate officers  to ensure the passages of staff or the shipment of our effects.  Whereas an organisation such as ours should have been able to secure  facilities much more readily and with no unnecessary waste of time.  I later discovered ' had much better arrange  ments laid on being more in a position to demand. After  Nieholl s departure on January 23rd all this devolved upon Fisher  and myself .and he and I had to evacuate most of the staff and their  belongings.    When Cooper left Singapore for India at the  beginning of the year it was said that routine work and our  accounting work would then fall to a minimum. On that assumption  I agreed to undertake and supervise our expenditure. But it soon  turned out that the minimum was a bonny elephantine babe who  rivalled his predecessor in bulk. With inadequate help it was  impossible to do more than struggle along and the record is far    from being full and complete. Mrs. Hutchings who should have    looked after the Petty Cash and the visits to the Banks became more, Page 3.    and more upset as the bombing increased eventually went off  without giving any notice. Mrs. Faultier was being trained by me    for keeping the record of expenditure and was coming on    excellently but having am infant she had to evacuate from    Singapore towards the end of Jamary. With these deficiencies    to struggle with the best that can be done will be to endeavour    to patch together such information and recording as could in the    circumstances be maintained.    In the rush of events and with the difficulties  described and rest demands for cash the office cash account went  awry and would not balance. That will be explained as best as  may be when there is time quietly and peacefully to examine such  records a could be kept.    With the collapse of resistance in Malaya and the  rapid advance of the Japanese the up-country branches of the  banks concentrated upon Singapore and upset the ordinary routine  of the local branches. The latter were up to their eyes in work  trying to straighten out tangles caused by the collapse and the  influx of their branches. It was only as a special favour that I  managed to get the January statements from the Hongkong k Shanghai  and Chartered Banks and there was no hope of getting the February  entries la our bank accounts written up for us. It is therefore  not possible to state accurately what balances we held at the time  of departure or fall of Singapore or what balances were trans  ferred to our main H. & S. Bank account from the other two banks.    At the end of December 1941 our bank balances had  been pared down to a minimum and remittances requested for January  were modest. Therefore sudden unadvised demands early in January  were embarrassing especially with a long Lonaon-Slngapore  telegraphic time lag and the new-anticipated expenditure for  January/February necessitated a request for a further fifty  thousand dollars In January and February.    By the middle of January I was becoming anxious  about the prompt transfer of our funds away from Singapore prior  to the balloon going up. It had been my idea to remit them to the  order of i . in a bask In India. Other Beans were discussed and  Considered but no instructions given. Hearing that K might be  in Batavia I then took the precaution of obtaining from Mr. Kelson  Jones Controller of Foreign Exchange a special permit to remit  fifty thousand dollars to H.E.I. In the end the possession of  this permit was of great value and saved the bulk of our funds.  The prospects of having to finance in Singapore various under  takings did not seem to die readily even up to a late moment.  It was not until the evening of Monday February 9th that I was  instructed to make a remittance of Fifty thousand dollars and as  I had the permit mentioned above to send the money to K at  Batavia., Pag 4    Barly on the fuesday l saw tii Manager of the    I. k S. Bask sfeout the raalttaaoe provided him wltk a signed  QovGTwmnt prioritr teiegraai fora for tbs ptarpose.  fltis left a balance in mir acoount and as S. or M.  thmxght they w l ht still want more casb It ms arranged that they  wonll deal with this remainder as well as pay off the native staff.    With the party that left Singapore for Batavia on  Fehrmry 1st I took the precaution of sending doxm cheque books  aeeowntsr and salary statements petty cash book and emh vouchers  as there were and also the personnel records of all M.E.W.F.l.M.  staff. Even by that date it seemed mere than possible that there  would or could be no further evacuations from Singapore and fro  the papers enumerated above it would have been possible to deduce  a record of our expenditure up to a date towards the end of -January.  All these records were received in Batavia and when I passed  through there on February 16th I was told that they were easafed  in the British Consulate General. At the last minute when I left  Singapore I carried with me the cheque books and such notes as it  was hoped would enable us to compile a statement of our expenditures.  But sueha statement will not I fear be complete in detail though I  trust that it will be accepted after scrutiny in London and after  any questions it raises have been put to me In spite of the lack   f supporting vouchers arid statements of expense it should be noted  that for all the larger outlets of money we were shorn statements  accepted by S 1. or myself. For instance Devonshire Lyon  Parsons Weir and %/WE submitted satisfactory expense statements.  the Scapula statement dated list January was among the papers sent  t Batavia and the petty cash book will provide a record of payments  recorded by Mrs. lutehLags up to tins date of her departure.    But there is another reason than lack of time -and  staff to explain absence of detail. That is associated with the  problem of bulk and security. Although for security reasons much  was incinerated we retained a mass of papers which were the cause  of much anxiety towards the end f oar stay. Bombs and shells fell  in our vicinity iyi tkoagh in. the event none hit us there was the  fear of damage and accidental loss through it. Added to that the  prospects for a stiddem collapse would have left us with a bulky mass  of confidential pagers too imponderable for a last-minute  conflagration. Much was burst but even so it will be seen that  I had to care for four heavy mail bags of secret papers over and  above the three large parcels I sent to Batavia by the February 1st  party. The security and preservation of all these was attained by  good luck rather than by other factors.    Finally it is a propos to comment-upon the ooaplete  lack of intelligence and the difficulties created for us by that.  If it had been known that Singapore was to be give up without a  struggle -as it eventually was -we ought to have evacuated our,  4    P&ge 5.    records and morw of the staff at a such earlier date. On the  other hand if it was to be held and perhaps beselged then we  had to act differently and to try to arrange to carry on operations.  From this memorandum it will be seen that we were all along left  in dottbt and nerer in fact anticipated so sudden and so complete  a collapse. Right up to February 9th there was the possibility  of funds being required for operations and we ted to sit on the  fence as regards destruction of records and evacuating them., TOP  SECRET    15 I'lo'veaber Iv 5    Bimm.

SACSBA   -ooOoo   1.  Before the Meeting General GUBBIKS lianded the Chief of staff  a memorandxim entitled HS.O.E. R ntnre Tasks in the Far East   ftppx Aw  2.  The Chief of staff stated that he had only had tine to give  this a cursory glance but he woxild like confirmation that  both Services 3.X.3. and S.O.E. would disappear as  individual services on 15 January approximately and would  be re-formed under one Head with effect from that date.  General GTJB11I1IS confirmed.  3.  S.A.C. had decided that a paper was to be prepared in  conjunction with Coramander-in-Chief INDIA to be put  before the C.I.G.S. which would discuss the future set-up  of defence of IIDIA and SOUTH EAST ASIA COMMAND.  4.  As far as clandestine services were concerned this paper  should bring out tho fact that a Commander would bo required  In SOUTH EAST ASIA COMMAND to be the Head of the Combined  Service and that this Commander would be responsible  operationally to the Chief of Staff through Deputy Chief  of Staff the latter having a Staff Officer to deal with  clandestine jnattera.     5.  How that clandestine operations have com to form part  of a Theatre Corsaande s strategy it must be brought out  that Staff must be aware of the ramifications so as to  consider then in all administrative requirements in the  same way as other Services.  6.  The Chief of Staff pointed out the need for a nucleus of  staff at home who would be trained and ready to be despatched  to any theatre to cope with the immediate expansion that  would became necessary should a state of war once again  exist. He stated that he considered a School of Instruction  should form part of the permanent peace-time set-up but  General GUB INS pointed out that financial restrictions  /  would limit this severely and that he could keep only four  to six training officers but he would.probably be able  to call back officers with knowledge and experience in the  case of an emergency. It would however be essential  in view of the nature of clandestine work that these  should be called back in the early stages of an emergency  and not when a state of war actually existed.    7. General GUBBINS explained that 3.O.E. was now under the  Foreign Office and that it had also been decided that  for the present the Combined Service when formed would  also be under the Foreign Office. The Chief of Staff  pointed out that from a military point of view till would, 8    9.  10.  11.  12.      2    be very unsatisfactory and he would recomend to 3.A.C.  that in the paper to C.I.G.3. it should be brought out  that the clandestine services should coxae under the Chiefs  of staff and if possible be respondble direct to a Service  Minister. He felt that in this way the relation between  the Services' requirements and availability would be co  ordinated whereas if left under the Foreign Office this  would not be the case    General GrUBFII-IS explained that a Scientific Advisory Committee  was in being and wotild concentrate on research for special  operations equipment dealing primarily w1th wireless  sabotage equipment and special weapons. The Chief of  Staff felt that this Establishment should consider the  requirements of Combined Operations 3.A.3. S.O.Gs. end  any other of the pt ra-military and Combined Service forces  which the 1939 -48 War had proved to be a requirement.  He therefore considered that one experimental establishment  should be formed to serve all Services. General GUBbIKS  stated that S.O.E. s present proposals for the future were  that the existing scientific Advisory Committee to S.O.E.     consisting of Sir Edward APPLETOH as Chairman and the  Scientific Advisers of Admiralty M.A.P. and Ministry of  Supply should continue as the scientific advisers to the  Combined Secret Service and that the proposed Research  Establishment for peace-time two scientific superintendents  three assistant superintendents and suitable staff plus  laboratories etc. could also cover all the requirements  of the S.I. Branch. These proposals are now before 'C  for agreement.    General GbBBINS stated that a new Directive was  Issued to 3.0. .. which would later apply to the 3 0 Branch  of the Combined Service which instructed the Head of the  Combined Service to stake such preparations and plans for  operations and admin stration in peace-time which could  be expanded rapidly in the event of hostilities. In  this the Head of the Combined Service was instructed to  report once a quarter to the J.P.3 on the progress that  he was making with his plans.    It was pointed out that it was Impossible to prepare on  a short-term basis by the use of officers with knowledge  and experience of this theatre unless there was a radical  change In the whole system under which at present the S.I.  side was being run. The personnel of the S.O. Branch  at any rate so far as SOUTH EAST ASIA was concerned had  no c onfidence in the Head Office of the S.I organisation  as reflected in its lower foiroationa and therefore it was  hoped that in the paper which 3.A.C. would be presenting  to C.I.G.S. it would be made manifest that a radical  change in control and management was an essential.   Captain GAHHOIS-WILLIAMS asked that he might receive a  brief as to what the SOUTH EAST &SIA views were on the new  set-up so that he might represent these views In LOUDON.  He stated that they would b represented to C and General  I3MAY.    C.O 3 stated that he would prepare a memorandum on the  operational requirements of this theatre in respect to  secret operations and intelligence. and that these would b  considerable. This memorandum would be submitted by S.A. C.  to the Chiefs -of Staff.    Copies 1 -2 -Lieut.-General F.A.M. BEGHHXSG 3% D3  ... 3 -4 -Major-General C. McV.

S.O.E. in S.E.A.C. theatre Force 136 is being  entirely liquidated as the work on which it was  recently engaged has now become of a completely  overt character. The role which Force 136 has carried  out in this theatre has proved that irregular  operations and subversive activities are of particular  importance in this vast theatre. It is essential  against the eventuality of another war that adequate  preparations are made In time of peace for the  resumption of these activities when required.  A directive to S.O.E. which also applies when S.O.E.    becomes a branch of the Combined Secret Service has  just been agreed by the Chiefs of Staff and the    Foreign Office and copies are being sent to all    Commanders concerned. It is understood that the    functions of S.O.E. in peace time are to be     a  To maintain an organisation capable  of rapid expansion in time of war.   b  To undertake research and development of  means of communication special devices  weapons etc. and to arrange for their  production on a large scale If required.   c  To train personnel required for S.O.E.  work whether agents or Service personnel.   d  To make such clandestine contacts as may  be necessary in foreign countries.   e  To establish clandestine means of communicati-o-n  where required.   f  To undertake Special Operations  be required by a theatre commander or other  Government Departments.  Activity under d e and f in any foreign country  will however be subject to Foreign Office approval.    2  The Directive will probably lay down that those  countries bordering on the present Russian zones of  influence must have the highest priority.    3  The military problem looked at from the clandestine  aspect is different in the Par East from that in  Europe since in the Far East there are very large  territories which are British such as BURMA MALAYA  and parts of BORNEO but in which clandestine  preparations against occupation may have to be made., 2    4.  There are three possible enemies in the Par East  RUSSIA CHINA and JAPAN and of course any  combination of those three. The possible theatres  of operations are the same as in this war.  In British territories clandestine preparations for    resistance activities in the event of occupation by the    enemy whether from the operational or intelligence    aspect should be a function of the regular services    on the analogy of Auxiliary Units formed in the U.K    in June 1940 and the succeeding months in preparation    for a possible German occupation. Much modification    would however be necessary to suit local conditions.    6.  In foreign countries whether potentially hostile or  friendly clandestine activities will be the function  of the Combined Secret Service. -The degree to  which they will be possible or necessary in time of  peace depends on many factors. Foreign Office approval  will at present in all cases be essential. In the  Case of countries such as SIAM and P.I.C. subject  to the same possibilities of aggression as British  territory it may be possible to co-ordinate  arrangements mutually on an official level. As  regards CHINA it may be considered desirable to make  preparations within the country unknown to the Chinese  authorities. The possibility of action in JAPAN  cannot be anticipated for some time yet in view of the  American attitude but would undoubtedly be useful.  7.  Depending on many decisions that have not yet been made  the type of activities which may require to be carried oj  clandestinally in the Far East are  a  Preparations of a resistance nature in British  territories by ordinary Service channels and  authorities.   b  Penetration and preparations by the Combined  Secret Services in  a  CHINA and outlying territories   b  SIAM.   c  F.I.C.   d JAPAN.   e Possibly N.E.I  on the co-ordination in some cases of arrangements  mutually through Staff talks. In such cases where  there is doubt of stability of the existing regime    both  methods may be necessary.    8.  The Immediate Future.  There will be no S.O.E. organisation in this theatre  after November 15th eccept on a purely temporary  administrative basis for liquidation. What is    required now is a plan for the re-establishment of an  organisation to carry out the functions which will  appear in the new Directive,     -3-   By decision of the Prime Minister on the    recommendation of the Chiefs of Staff and the    Foreign Office a combined Secret Service under    one executive head is to be created this will    take  place in January 1946. This will have a    Special Intelligence Branch with common services    in the form of Administration Finance Communications    Research and Development etc.    The basis on which this Combined Service will require    representation in the Far East cannot be finally -/    decided until the Defence Organisation of the Far    East  as a whole has been settled. What will be    required however is a local head of Secret Service    in the Far East working with whatever authority    is established and controlling both the operational    and Intelligence sides.    Preparations for future S.O.E. work in the Far    Eastern theatre must be made with the greatest degree    of secrecy. This is simplified by the fact that the    existing S.O.E. Group Force 136 is being wound up    completely. The first practical step for the future    that  is required is to appoint the officer who will    plan  the clandestine aspect of Far Eastern defence and    who  when plans have been approved will commence the    necessary organisation. This officer should normally    work  direct to C.O.S. as a personal contact.    It is considered that a 'P' Division will no longer be    required as the British Secret Services will by then be    commanded under a common head and no O.S.S will exist    so co-ordination will not be necessary D.C.O.S.    however should have a Staff Officer on the J.P.S.    level to deal from the service point of view with all    clandestine matters to work with J.P.S. and I.    branches through normal staff channels and to    make  all arrangements for expansion In war.    Organisational and administrative matters of a military    type  will form a large part of his work so it is    considered he should be a regular soldier staff    trained of the rank of Lt.Colonel or Colonel    The local head of the Combined Secret Services should  be appointed as soon as his functions are decided    so that he may commence his planning in conjunction  with the regular services. It will take some months  to complete even this in view of the very delicate  questions involved and the high-level decisions that    will be required initially. Questions for decision  will bej    a  The degree of activity to be permitted in each  country.   b The communicational system.     c  The maintenance of stocks of equipment stores  special devices etc.  Arrangements have been made by Force 136 for the necessary  records to be handed over particularly the voluminous  card indices of personalities 3o as to facilitate the  re-commencement of preparations.]]
