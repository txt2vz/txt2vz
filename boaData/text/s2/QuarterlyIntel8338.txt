Navy been entirely conventional its ships equipment slackening its phenomenal rate growth the advent ballistic missile other new developments combined indicate changes more advanced ship types weapon systems already active preparation Submarine Construction most important development field been severe cut construction rate for class long range submarines principal building yard Gorkiy Volga devotes considerable proportion its effort the construction river craft other yards are known have cut building rates cut occurred earlier was expected since 200 class submarines been built cannot due deficiencies class are two likely reasons for reduction building rate first possibly the total Soviet submarine strength some 450 boats about maximum the allocated manpower logistic machinery can support the second that new class submarine believed contemplated there positive evidence nature new class present believed improved conventional type expected this new class shortly into production will continue built replacement for older boats Soviet shipyards ready over wholeheartedly nuclear submarine construction beginning regular programme nuclear propelled submarines 3, will await assessment prototype likely the existence prototype revealed 1958 Surface Ship Construction reduction surface ship construction was reported last year remained force only major units have built 1957 been Kotlin class destroyers Riga class escorts thought construction latter class ceased will replaced 1958 improved type vessel with higher speed better armament Kotlins are expected cease year two will probably succeeded new type may armed with surface air guided missile has little report Sverdlov class four are still uncompleted has been confinned one Sverdlov completed Severe Dvinsk Molotovsk had earlier thought bringing total class service fifteen some turrets uncompleted Sverdbvs been removed suggested these ships may possibly converted guided missile launchers Personnel Training have new developments field one consequence reduction building rates inevitably more time can devoted raising overall efficiency Fleet less basic training newly constructed units Surface units continue make voyages outside Soviet controlled waters unidentified submarines still being detected all over world that Soviet crews getting and sea time distant waters Fighting Efficiency field tactical weapon efficiency still considered the Soviet Navy some distance travel can regarded fully effective Major surface units still appear lack necessary equipment for direction modem high speed aircraft there seems reason suitable equipment could fitted short time New aerials believed for ECM purposes been seen cruisers Kotlin class destroyers clear the Soviet Navy paying great attention electronic warfare anti submarine warfare Soviet Navy still deficient date weapon there signs its detection capabilities, are improving improvement direction also benefit Soviet submarines for only their target detection abilities increase they become accustomed dealing with modern escorts Operational Activity contrast 1956 surface units Soviet Navy neglected Northern European ports programme cruises have paid attention the Mediterranean Split Yugoslavia had two visits cruiser destroyer squadrons Durazzo Albania Latakia Syria each had one visit One unusual step taken two Kotlin class destroyers the

shipping this threat not increased quantitatively fast was expected great extent will compensated for the earlier introduction improved submarines higher state training Future Developments has been said advent nuclear submarine into Soviet Navy now long delayed once type begins reach Fleet operational quantities threat Soviet submarines increase sharply present fragmentary evidence era likely

10 000 Imperial gallons say 4 tons oil Towed 60 launch speed about 5 knots Dracone was about four fifths submerged shown possess satisfactory degree stability manoeuvrability company now embark upon commercial operational trials inland waterways and abroad prepared materials designs for 200 Dracone with diameter 10 capacity about 300 tons barge filled discharged through self sealing quick acting hose connexion stern emptied wound floating reel 9 long 5 diameter readily transportable water overland Alternatively for long distance transport Dracones can folded into compact packages sent any convenient means are said suitable for transport liquid lighter water for dry cargoes grain especially remote parts they can used necessary for temporary storage the idea flexible barge conceived Professor Hawthorne Geoffrey Taylor Shaw Cambridge University two years ago practicable thus longer doubt project still experimental stage several oil companies shown interest too early pronounce definitely question commercial application yet clear for example loading discharge busy wharf present special problems with Dracone risk damage the fire hazard congested waterways need careful assessment Above all economics project inevitably nebulous stage thought 100 Dracones manufactured quantity for 37, 000 apiece for about half cost ordinary dumb barge the same capacity whereas latter life 25 30 years which course would cost for repair maintenance Dracone being desisned for live year life its inventors hope last longer and other matters need further investigation use Dracones can regarded practical commercial proposition inland waterways alone use bigger versions sea promising project been conceived brought the birth there doubt its progress watched with close sympathetic
