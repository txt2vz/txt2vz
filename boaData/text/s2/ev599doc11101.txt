FRENCH RESISTANCE IN NATIONAL TERRITORY  C.0.S. 45 ISO 0    THE COMMITTEE had before them the translation of a  letter/ from General de Gaulle to the Prime Minister  which together with Major Morton s comments had  been referred by the Prime Minister for the comments of  the Chiefs of Staff    Reference was also made to a letter7 dated  14th March from UC.D.5' to Lieutenant-General Ismay  pointing out that not all the resisting groups to v/hich  General de Gaulle referred in his letter were of the  de Gaullist persuasion    GROUP CAPTAIN GRIERSON explained that S.O.E wer  in touch with various factions of resistance in Franc  some of which but not all supported General de Gaul  The policy which S.O.E had followed in the past had  been to damp down any overt resistance which in thef  opinion would be premature5 until we were in a position  to supply them with adequate quantities of arms and  equipment but secretly to encourage the organisation of  all factions prepared to resist the Germans. Any  concerted rising should be timed to coincide with our  invasion of French territory. There was some danger  that General de Gaulle might encourage resistance in  France to proportions beyond our present capacity for  supporting it and the subsequent disappointment might  adversely affect the clandestine operations on which we  counted for help at the time of invasion.    G.0.S. 45 120 0 Annex I.   C.O.3. 45 120 0 Annex II.     Annex  -1, 9 IT 4    He suggested that General de Gaulle should he informed  that the co-ordination of the measures for providing support  to the resisting groups was in the hands of S.O.E. and that  he should he invited to inform the groups with v/hom he was  in contact that they should not at present break out into    open resistance.    MAJOR GENERAL KENNEDY said that a policy of  indiscriminate support would encourage Frenchmen to take  to the hills in an attempt to escape German forced labour  and that the problem of supplying them would soon be quite  beyond our powers. He pointed out that the Joint  Intelligence Sub-Committee had been instructed to report  on the value of the intelligence on which General de Gaulle s  letter had been based and suggested that any report to the  Prime Minister should be deferred until the Joint  Intelligence Sub-Committee 9 report had been received    GROUP CAPTAIN GRIERSON said that in the meanwhile    S.O.E. would require guidance on the extent to which the  present conflagration should be supported. He gave the  Committee an estimate of the air effort required to  maintain guerillas in France  THE COMMITTEE     a  Agreed that at this stage S.O.E. should  not embark on a large scale supply of  food arms and equipment to bodies of  local resistance in France   b  Agreed to defer a reply to the Prime  Minister until after consideration  of the report by the Joint Intelligence  Sub-Commi11ee.  -2, 3 E H  tl ei    0.

THE COMMITTEE had before then a note by S.O.E.  putting forward a proposal for a psychological warfare  undertaking in Norway by O.S.3. based on Iceland c    GROUP CAPTAIN GRIERSON explained to the Committee  what was involved in the 0 S.S. proposal. The Americans  were anxious to branch out in Norway largely because  there was a Norwegian colony in the United States from  which suitable material could be drawn their operations  in other parts of the world had been handicapped by lack  of suitably qualified personnel.    It was envisaged that it would take some time to  develop this undertaking the beginnings of which would  be based in the United Kingdom for transfer to Iceland  in due course.    S.O.E. had established the closest relations with  O.S.S. in this country and were in favour of the proposal  now put forward.  REAR ADMIRAL BRIND said that from the point of  view of co-ordinating the operations of S.O.E S I.S  and P.W.E. on the Norwegian coast the Admiralty could  not accept the situation involving competition by yet  another authority. If the American proposal was agreed    it should only be on the condition that the operational    and strategic direction of their operations should come  under the Admiralty and that the channel of this control    should be via S.O.E.    Admiral Brind said that the Admiralty were particularly  anxious to safeguard S.I.S. interests in Norway.    After further discussion it was decided that there  would be no objection to the American proposal provided  that the conditions suggested by Admiral Brind were accepted.  These would require clear and tactful definition.    THE COMMITTEE -   Invited S.O.E. to prepare a draft reply    approving the American proposal subject    to the above conditions and to circulate    it for the concurrence of the Vice Chiefs    of Staff before despatch.    Offices of the War Cabinet S.W.I.   15TH MARCH 1943.    -3, ANWE.V    COPY OF A LETTER DATED 1VTH MRCH FROM    C.D. TO LIEUT. GENERAL ISMAY  I should like the Vice-Chiefs of Staff to know when  they consider General de Gaulle's letter No. 918/MP/2  to the Prime Minister that the groups who are at the  moment resisting labour conscription and have congregate '  in the more inaccessible parts of the country are-by no  means all of 1 he de Gaullist persuasion.    The one principal group which consists of-some 1 500     men and to which we hope to make a considerable delivery  of arms and food tonight35 is in fact mainly composed of  men led by officers in contact with S.D.E. They appear  to have been joined by a number of de Gaullists and we  have received wireless messages which indicate that they  have all congregated in the neighbourhood of EVIAN les Bains    It would seam to be advisable therefore not to give  de Gaulle himself any specific undertaking and for him to  be told that we the British will support all Frenchmen who  are prepared to resist the Germans regardless of whether they  own allegiance to de Gaulle or not. I feel he should be told  that the co-ordination of measures for providing this support  has been put in the hands of S.O.E. whose task it is.    S.O.E. have as far as possible always advised the  populations of the enemy occupied countries against a  premature rising since we cannot hope to provide arms and  food for all yet and since the repressive measures taken  are likely to have a serious adverse-effect on the assistance  we hope will be forthcoming when an Allied landing on the  Continent takes place. We have in this instance warned  those people with whom we are in contact to do everything in  their power to prevent the present wave of resistance from  spreading.  I suggest that the General should be asked to counsel  similar restraint amongst those ol his adherents in France  with whom he is in direct contact. Where revolt is  unavoidable it is suggested that the numbers who do so should  be kept to the minimum and that they should as far as  possible include only the more important members of the  organisations concerned together with their staunchest and  most determined followers. They help we can give is limited  and we cannot hope to maintain supplies by air to large  numbers of men all over the country.      C.0.S. 13 120 0 .  s  Flight subsequently hold up by  bad weather., 357    Yie have examined carefully what can he done to supply  bodies of men who have collected in inaccessible parts of  the country with the air resources at present available to  S.O.E. and also what could be done if additional aircraft  were specially provided.    Group Captain Grierson is fully briefed in the whole  matter and I am sending him along in case the Vice-Chiefs  would like to question him on any particular aspect of it.    -5, TOP SECRET CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY    WAR CABINET   CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE    C.O.S. 43 0 MEMORANDA  101-200  YOL.

There are already several authorities interested in  operations on the Norwegian coast namely S.I.S. S.O.E.  C.C.O. and P.W.E and they already cover the activities  which O.S.S. proposes to undertake. The Chiefs of Staff  regret therefore that they cannot agree to yet another  independent organisation operating in Norway.  3. The assistance of 0 3.3 in planning or in operations  concerning Norway is welcomed but it is necessary that all  their activities should be conducted through S.O.E. who  will co-ordinate them with those of other British  authorities and ensure that they conform to the procedure  and priorities already arranged.   o, TOP SECRET CONFIDENTIAL LIBRARY    WAR CABINET   CHIEFS OF STAFF COMMITTEE    C.O.S. 43 0 MEMORANDA  101-200  YOL.

Crockett A.C. of S G-2 ETO.    2. The preliminary phase of this Mission was concluded  on 14 September 1943 when Major Brewer submitted a report of  his reconnaissance trip to Stockholm which was approved by  Colonel Bruce.  3. Upon the basis of this report and also of a report  by the Chief Field Representative of the SOE Branch in Stockholm  to his London HQ full discussions have now been held between  the Chief of the Scandinavian Region of SOE the Chief of the  German Section of SOE and the Chief of the Scandinavian Section  of the SO Branch of the OSS.  4. As a result of these conversations the following  proposals have been agreed upon and are herewith set forth for  approval by the appropriate authorities of the SOE and the  Chief of the London Mission of the OSS  a That the OSS Mission referred to in para 3 of the basic  communication be given the code name of Westfield .   b That the Chief of the Westfield Mission be made  directly responsible tothe Chief of the SO Scandinavian  Section of the OSS London.   c That in all decisions of policy taken in London  affecting eitherthe composition or the activities of the  SOE Stockholm Mission or of the Westfield Mission that  their respective Chiefs in the field shall be notified  ji simultaneously in a communication issued jointly by the Chiefs    i  of the Scandinavian Sections of the SOE and the SO Branch of  the OSS and further that all questions of policy arising  in the field shall be submitted by the representative Chiefs  of Missions simultaneously and under joint signature to the  Chiefs of Sections in London.     d That all operations undertaken by Westfield and  all operations undertaken by the SOE organization in Stockholm  be considered in principle as joint SOE/SO operations but  that in general Westfield will concentrate its efforts  on spheres not hitherto covered or not yet satisfactorily  developed by the SOE and that among these spheres may be  mentioned Finland the Baltic States and Germany.   e That in consideration of this principle and in order  not tooverlap the SOE field of operations full consultations  shall be held between the Chief of the SOE Stockholm Mission  and the Chief of the Westfield Mission in advance of any  contemplated operations by Westfield or by the SOE which  might involve a dangerous crossing of lines and that such  consultations/, 2  3   consultations shall include the employment of agents the  making of contacts and other matters of a similar character.     f That the fullest possible exchange of facilities  shall be maintained between the SOE and Westfield Mission  such as -means of communication personal contacts  intelligence and the securing of transportation of material  and personnelj and that each Mission shall render the other  all possible assistance in the prosecution of their joint  enterprises.   g That nothing in this Agreement shall in any measure  prejudice the authority of the Chief of the SOE Stockholm  Mission or of the Chief of the Westfield Mission to exercise  full control over the activities and discipline of members  of their respective organizations.  5. It is anticipated that the MO Section of the OSS will  be engaged in Scandinavian activities in the future and will  desire to introduce field agents into Sweden for the furtherance  of these activities. Preliminary talks have been held between  the SO Scandinavian Section and the MO Chief suggesting the  desirability of very close liaison in the field. The general  nature of theunderstanding arrived at in these preliminary  discussions is indicated by the attached memorandum.   Sgd. Lt.Col.J.S.Wilson O.B.E.  Chief Scandinavian Section  SOE.

It is -understood that some time after 1 January 1944  the M.O.Branch will have representatives in Sweden whose  operations will be directed toward Norway Denmark  Finland the Baltic States and Germany.  2. The SO Branch has established a Mission in Sweden and  is in process of setting up lines of communications  lines of supply and establishing essential contacts.  3. It is hoped that the M.O. representatives will avail  themselves of S.O. resources and services thus avoiding  the necessity of setting up independent facilities of  their own.  4. If these S.O. facilities prove adequate for M.O.  operations arran pnents for their use will be made by  request of the M.O. field representative to Lt.Col.Brewer  Chief of the S.O. Field Mission with the understanding  that all operational details contacts etc. will  remain under his control.  5. If on the other hand these facilities do not  prove adequate for M.O. operational purposes and M.O.  is obliged to set up its own independent underground  organization it is agreed that the M.O. field represent  ative will inform Colonel Brewer accordingly.

Major Brewer and SN/US have had conversations with  MA who has been in communication with D/FIN/l.    The latter states that to the best of his  knowledge the policy as to the degree of our  responsibilities for participating in the  arrangements for O.S.S. Training Schools was  still undecided.    Would you kindly take up this question in  Cornell so that the necessary arrangements  can be made to secure accommodation for a total  number of 20 officers and 100 O.R.s., ADi/m.

Three Norwegian/American Operational Groups  in all of 15 officers and 95 men have been recruited  and are in training in the U.S.  It is expected that these Groups will leave U.S. on  completion of their training between 15th August 1943  and 1st September 1943. O.S.S. intention is  to house them somewhere in the Scottish Highlands  sufficiently far from AVIEMORK so as not to interfere  with N.I.C.l. Three Norwegian Officers including  Lt. Stromholt have been asked for for attachment.    2.  Ihave said I could not guarantee any employment  ..  although there may be possibilities of four targets.  This is complicated by C.C.O's request for employment  of his men. I have stipulated that the Theatre  Commander should approve these Groups1 reversion to  ordinary Military employ after a certain date  say 1st October 1943 if no special employment is  then open to them.    3.  Lt. Col. VANDERBLUE has given his personal  that the Groups would not be employed in Norway  except under S.O.E s auspicies.  ICELAND.    4.  We are seeking expert advice on the advisability of  sailing M.P.Vs from SHETLAND to the Arctic Circle  and North via ICELAND.  This two-legged course is not as iantastic as it first  appears because it gives i totally different line of  approach under greater cover of darkness. If aavice  is favourable re-fuelling etc. will have to  be done in ICELAND.    5.  We are in ignorance as to whether O.S.S. has proceeded any  further with the suggestion for an ICELAND BASE.  6.  I am still concerned as to the possible employment of  U.S.  troops in ICELAND for a landing in North Norway.  TRANSPORT.    7.  We have suggested that O.S.S. best contribution  form of additional air transport for S.O.E.purposes or to  strengthen the Scotland-Stockholm service and ol w/T t  and other equipment. /] i, Si    2.  3.   cD/1079  f 26.4 43   ICD/1079 \tv 'j i I    To  SN through D/Plans From M/CD    taBia  ..    -   Reference Sli/062 dated 24.4.43.    There are two different aspects to be  consibered     a  The employment of Auxiliary Operations  Groups with American regular forces invading  Norway and   b  The possible employment of A.O.Gs. for  coups de main.  I exclude the possibility of infiltrating any  personnel of A.O.Gs. for resident work in Korway  unless some man is found who is lOOf suitable and  taken on by the Norwegian Government for this purpose.    If American forces are used for an invasion  of Norway they will certainly want to use A.O.Gs  and I consider myself that these could play an  Important role if properly instructed. This is  however a matter which should be taken up primarily  by O.S.S. with General Barker of the Combined Planners  as it is a matter for the American Commander l.T.O. S.A.  to decide upon being within his jurisdiction. I  have no objection to O.S.S. doing this but It must  be co-ordinated with Dh/Plans/M who is our joint link  with the Combined Planners. Should such A.O.Gs be \  brought over here they will not be our responsibility  for housing or adminiistration but we will have to  take a share in their instruction.    The question of the use of A.O.Cs. in coup de  main parties is much more difficult. If they w re  100R suitable by which I mean as qualified fox' the  job as your best personnel in L.I.C.d -then I see  no objection to their being used. That could onfly  be verified by seeiibg the men over here or sepning one  of your officers to America or getting General    llanetoen's, Hansteen1s representative to see them In America  Fleas disoussfeiiisvfith him.

SUMMARY OF PHOPOSBD PSYCHOLOGICAL     TKWZi  iri iToT ay    A complete discussion of this  plan is attached as Annex A    1. The Office of Strategic Services presents the followinr  plan for psychological warfare activities in Norway.  2. Objectives   a  To carry on psychological warfare activities   S.O. in Norway.   b  To obtain psychological warfare Information   S.I. in Norway.   c  To undertake counter-subversive and counter  intelligence activities.   d  To-train operatives to accomplish the fore  going objectives.  3.  Line of Action  It Is proposed to establish an operational base in  Iceland for carrying on psychological warfare In Norway with  the assistance of the Norwegian Governraent-in-fxile and the  Norwegian underground.    Initial reconnaissance will'be conducted by a group  landed by submarine off the Norwegian coast. Recruits from  the local population will be transported to the Iceland base  for psychological warfare training and for subsequent reintroduction  into Norway as operatives and field agents.    4 Requirements     a  Air sea and submarine transportation for  delivery and supply of personnel and material   b  Cormsmnications equipment and facilities Appendix 1  attached .   c  Other material requirements Appendix 1 attached .   d  Replacement of military personnel furnished from OSS  Headquarters Washington to the Iceland base.   Appendix 2 attached .    & Requested Action.    That the Joint U.S. Chiefs of Staff     a  Authorize the proposed undertaking as outlined above.   b  Approve the procurement or requisition from  appropriate branches of the U.S. Government of the  supplies and equipment listed in Appendix 1 hereto.   c  Direct appropriate branches of the Army Navy and  other Government services and departments to cooperate  and assist in providing such transportation facilities  as shall be required and as shall be available.   d  Authorize the procurement objectives and allotments  for replacement of commissi oned and enlisted  personnel listed in Appendix 2 hereto.   e  Authorize the assignment of Service personnel of the  Office of Strategic Services including enlisted  personnel o the ' . .' ..5 to duty at the Teeland ' ase, COPY   SEGiiST Copy 2 of    AMEX A   PuOPOo D PGYt.i10LO'i 1GAL Utu .. IN NORWAY    STATEMENT OP TRK S1T0AT1ON    The number of persons escaping from Norway to England has  sharply decreased. This results from Increased vigilance by  the Germans and from a shortage of boats and all other means of  transportation. Escapes by fishing boats have almost entirely  ceased and plane service from Sweden has been so curtailed that  only a very limited number of the Norwegians who have fled across  the border can be brought Into allied territory for use in psycho  logical warfare. Moreover the Introduction by plane of opera  tives into Norway is becoming more difficult for two reasons     a the pace of Gestapo counter-espionage activities in  Scandinavia is continuously being accelerated and b the  British Bm facilities are already overtaxed.  In consequence of the foregoing all phases of psychological  warfare in Norway have been greatly impeded. A source of recruits  who have known the German occupation In that country by personal  experience has largely been lost to the United Nations and  valuable channels of counter-intelligence have been practically  closed.    It is believed that the United Nations base in Iceland offers  useful possibilities for the conduct of psychological warfare in  Norway and for the establishment of essential lines of transpor  tation and communication. At this base supplies can be gathered  and training undertaken.    2. OBJECTIVES  A. General  1. To  in Norway the specific objectives listed below.  B. Specific  1. To carry on psychological warfare activities  designed to harass the enemy including physical and  morale subversion and black propaganda.  2. To obtain psychological warfare intelligence.  3. To undertake counter-subversive and counter  intelligence activities.  4. To train operatives to accomplish the  foregoing objectives.  3. LINE OF ACTION  It is proposed that the Norwegian Government-In-Exile be  consulted with a view towards obtaining its cooperation and the  assistance of underground organizations in Norway. Thereafter  an operational base and headquarters will be established in  Iceland.    A submarine carrying the initial reconnaissance party with  supplies and equipment will then be dispatched to an appropriate, SECHKT  -2-Copy2of2    30    point off the Norwegian coast to be agreed upon with represen  tatives of the underground decruits will be obtnlned from the  local population picked up at designated points and taken to  the base In Iceland for psychological warfare training. Subse  quently they will be reintroduced by air or sea Into Norway for  carrying on the objectives listed above.    Direction of the operations of the operatives in Norway will  be the responsibility of the OSS Operations Officer in London  directly or through an Operations Officer In Iceland. In aldltion  to maintaining contact with the Norwegian Governmont-in-Rxile    effective liaison will be established with the Theater Command  British SOE and SIS.    4.  FACTORS  A.  Specific Difficulties  Personnel.

The definition of psychological warfare as used herein shall  be as follows    The integrated employment of all moral and physical means  consonant with national political and economic policy and  coordinated with orthodox military operations which tend  to impair the enemy's will and power to resist or achieve  victory to deprive the enemy of the support of sympathy  of his allies and neutrals to increase the will to victory  of our own people and our allies and which tend to acquire  and increase the support and sympathy of neutrals.    Grouped as follows for convenience of reference psychological  warfare includes the following categories of operations.    Psychological Warfare PW 1 -Economic Persuasion.    Economic manipulations other than normal economic blockades  and measures directed against the enemy and orthodox trade  operations designed solely to influence neutral governments or  populations favourably toward the United States and her Allies  such as relieving economic stringencies through relaxation of  blockade or the contrary purchase of non-required products or  services to afford economic aid economic transactions and  activities which foster goodwill or relieve tensions and  exploitation thereof.    Psychological Warfare Two PW 2 -Open propaganda.    Directed primarily at influencing civilian groups or popu  lations abroad using as media pronouncements by prominent  officials statements and regulatory ordinances by theatre  commanders news manipulations through the press and radio  circulation of pamphlets publications and general cultural  propaganda.    Psychological Warfare Three PW 5 -Morale Subversion.    Directed primarily at influencing civilian groups or popu  lations abroad employing espionage black propaganda rumour  spreading designed to confuse deceive or intimidate bribery  and other morale destroying activities and consonant with  established national policy the manipulation of individuals  factions or partisans. Among the media for these activities are  word of mouth through agent clandestine radio subverted press  spread of subversive pamphlets or publications by clandestine  methods.    All the methods of deception intimidation subversive appeals  to superstition home-sickness hunger etc. with a view to  weakening the will to resist of enemy troops using such media as  loud speakers pamphlets posters sky writing.    Psychological Warfare Four PW 4 -physical Subversion.    Sabotage and other violent manifestations against enemy  persons or property activities designed to effect demolitions  spread confusion among enemy civilians or troops in key positions  and otherwise disrupt and soften enemy resistance organisation  and conduct of guerilla warfare by organisers fomenters and  operational nuclei in enemy or enemy-occupied territory.    Over/   /, i    Psychological Warfare give Fi 5 -Home Front Propaganda.    Directed primarily at our civilian population to increase  morale the will to victory using such media as     a  Military agencies prompt and accurate military  communiques news releases radio and movie  productions official statements and speeches by  prominent Army and Navy officers honours for  production accomplishments   b  Non-military agencies public statements and  speeches of leading officials news releases  radio and movie productions activities of  governmental agencies and civilian organisations  concerned with all phases of the conduct of war., C-tA'1-' 'i.V'   C L0SS C  frlPi-EP TELEeSMi DESPSTCHED TO KE YORK 16.12 42   U   fio-b   OS  YOUR 92614  n ORDERS CONCERNING SUBJECT HAVE BEEN ISSUED by NORWEGIAN  Hf'GH COMMAND TO THEIR HASHING ON OF ICE. /D    m further pressure is likely to have host unhelpful   U9 JI -   .J-J 5   norr ij 12 42e    .i G-FV'     U C-F V.-  AT   OHIQ1M, LOCAL 877    /   CIPHER TELEGRAM DESPATCHED TO NEW YORK 16. 2.42    C-L/i ss    no   nb    YOUR TELEGRAM 90712    sr   A.

Reference my DS/43 of the 5th December on which  you have taken action with U. I see that another  telegram No. 77505 from New York dated 6th December  has now arrived mentioning three Norwegian sailors  who have apparently/ been trained by Lt. Stromholt and '  whom the G.50 000 organization wish to send to the U.K.  as privates in the United States Army as possible  recruits for us.    I suggest that you make it quite clear to New York  that every Norwegian returning to the U.K. comes under  the orders of the Norwegian Government and it only com  plicates matters very badly at this end if he enlisted  into the U.S. Army of course if he is a U.S. citizen  it is a different matter and we should not want to use  him.    We are far more anxious to receive Norwegian sailors  here as sailors and not as 'gun' men trained by Lt.  Stromholt.    I spoke to-day to General Hansteen about this  matter in general and he is very anxious not to have his  Norwegians either sailors or soldiers recruited into  the U.S. Army. In fact his Government has already an  agreement to that effect with the U.S. authorities.    I am not quite certain what paragraph E. of H.M.  175' s telegram No. 77505 of the 6th December really  means but he seems to have got the whole matter muddled  up and I think the sooner it is taken out of his hands  and those of U. the better. We do not want out relations  with the Norwegian Government and the Norwegian Commanderin- Chief impaired by this American line of action.    As regards Stromholt this officer has been ordered  by General Hansteen to come to England to report to him  here when a decision can be made as to how his services  can best be made use of., Norwegian Operations.    The attached is a proposed draft of cable to  be sent to S.O. Washington through our channels.  SN has been consulted and approves the draft.    I understand Mr.Hoover head of S.I. Scandinavian  Desk of O.S.S. has an appointment with you at 16 hours  today. I should appreciate a word with you before  then., inrc- -/V-jr-  ' 3.  PC Entd   PARAPIffiASE of Cable sent to WASHINGTON   November 30th 1942   5   The despatch of the following message has been approved by  BAKER STREET. Concerning STROMHOLTs   A.  It is believed that an unfavorable view of STRCMNOLT  taken by the NORWEGIAN HIGH COMMAND is the result of  a misunderstanding.  B.  General HANSTEEN NORWEGIAN COMMANDER IN CHIEF is  perturbed by the receipt of certain correspondence  forwarded through the WASHINGTON NORWEGIAN LEGATION.  STROMHOLT figures in this correspondence which concerns  the formation by O.S.S. of two companies recruited from  NORWEGIANS and NORWEGIAN AMERICANS. It had been  HANSTEEN's understanding from Colonel FREDERICKS that  O.S.S. had stopped all subversive action in NORWAY.  C.  The suggestion made  that he be promoted has also been viewed unfavorably  D.  STROMHOLT is being recalled by General HANSTEEN and it is  felt here that this is the best way of clarifying this  misunderstanding.  It is anticipated that STROMHOLT can be fitted into the  NORWEGIAN organization as you suggest after this case  is adjusted in which particular adjustment BAKER STREET  will cooperate fully.  F.
