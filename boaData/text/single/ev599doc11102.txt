TO Colonel Ellery C Huntington and Major George Sharp.    1. There is a project still only in the preliminary stage which  may require the services of 10 to 20 Danish Americans.  2. These men must he of a distinctly high order of intelligence  fluent in the Danish language and it is desirable though not required  that they have a knowledge of the country.  3. These men will be given full training at the Danish Holding  School here side by side with an equal number of native Danes with  whom they will work.  4. It will probably be advisable however for such men as can  be recruited to receive a month's training in the United States during  which time they can be under strict observation and those who do not  come up to the mark weeded out.  5. Security of the highest order must be maintained in connect  ion with this project. The Danes are notoriously talkative and they  must be carefully drilled in this connection .  6. This letter should be considered only as preliminary notice.  No action towards recruiting these men should be taken until cable  advices are received.  7. The necessity for the strictest security in connection with  this project cannot be over emphasized.  David K.E.Bruce  Colonel A.C.  Director OSS London Mission., , SD/AK/1101  24. B. 48.

Some served until recently in No.62  Commando. There are other suitable ones in the Buffs For the  remainder required assuming we cannot fulfill bur requirements  c  from Danes in this country 0 SS. have offered to find suitable  material amongst Dan ish-Amerleans.in the U.S. Army and to send  them over to us after a six weehs special course ifi demolitions   vhioh would give time for the weeding out of unsuitable mater  ial.   '  ed ' ' '      iv . It is highly recommend/that.Captain Mogens Hammer who  has recently returned from 18 months excellent ork for us in   the Field should if found suitable be put in command . He  has the necessary courage and determination to inspire his men  with confidence and knows the country and its'present day    customs intimately.   4.  Training.  \ i . It is suggested that the training be carried out largely  at S.T.S. 45 where the unit would have the advantage of absor  bing the Danish atmosphere and would have access to all Danish  literature nevsspapeRs and local intelligence that are being  continually supplied to the school.   .. J k.-   y ..   ii . The unit would train .separately from ihe ordinary students  except for general subjects such as P.T. The addition of  specialist instructors would probably prove necessary. In the  early stages the unit would train as coup de main parties with   'with no specific targets in mind. For .security reasons they  would not be given details of the plan for their employment  until the personnel now awaiting despatch have left for the   Field.  .-.-j   V k. \..    f r t-\    iii .In the latter stages the unit wbuld train on realistic  schemes aimed at reproducing tjbe conditions they MIT meet in  tile Field.    iv .American students would'train in British Battle-dress by   arrangement with O.SS.   . .   of 11 \h   5.

The type of tasks to be assigned to them ill be decided  during their training. It is envisaged that they will have to  look after key points of communication destroy telecommunication  stations hold and deny to the enemy other points which the  Allies may wish to use.'     iii .Thirty men by themselves could  in the way of sabotage or resistance but it is'proposed that  they v.ork in groups and' that each group will work with the  support of local groups.   iv .In some asreas where the local  it might be possible for instance to seise and hold a landing  ground for a few hours if required.   v .They would establish and maintain  groups equipped with R/T communication and with h/T operators  who would be in com..unication with London.  Control.     i  .All troops would be under the command   ii .Orders to the Field would be given  at a later stage if action became very mobile plain language  would be used. Crack signals would also be used to a great  extent to indicate type.of action to be taken. This would en  able us to keep it in line with Allied plans.  It is considered vitally important that we should  establish such a reserve of sabotage shock troops because  although elaborate precautions are taken to protect the security  of our local organisations one can never know for certain how  long they will remain immune from penetration. If the Carmans  were to take over the Administration in Denmark it is on the  cards that we would lose Peter. The Table organisation itself  cannot carry out its programme without continually running  certain risks. If we were to lose both these organisations or  part of either it would be of great value if we had Coup de  tain parties ready to carry out urgent tasks in areas where we  may have temporarylost control. They would be coup de main  parties in the sense that they would before leaving be trained  to dealwith a limited number of specific targets but there  would be no. question of evacuation. For exceptional emergencies   we could though arrange for boats to be held in secret depots  at cei'tain points dlbag the coast facing Sweden.    8. It is requested that this uroposal be given favourable  consideration and that I be instructed as to the lines on  which I should proceed., ' SD/AX/1133 30. 8. 43  To U/C From SD.

I hastened to add that the agent ia question was on ice  smiting orders frora rse before talcing sny action. Because  of these circuasstartOM 1 said that I wanted to feel free  to discuss matters with the Naval Attache and that 1  vented them to know that the level Attache was in ray con  fidence I suggested to Hr.

At a Xstsr conversation with Mr W I iotroduoed  hits to ll our agent in the Nava 1 Attache s Office  described his peat history and explained to H that ha had  a cousin now in training in the first group of Norwegianrefugees who wore being Instructed by the Swedish police  near ilpaala University Apparently 1 cousin baa gjad a  number of trips into Norway and had sono interesting Inform  ation about certain riant which ho had reason to believe  mm n nufacturing a secret product t had already receiv  ed from hia cousin a drawing which he gave Sr who in  turn will forward it to Colonel Wilson   It ms agreed that during my absence Mr. and l  should be in contact with am another but that l should  talc no step of any kind without specific Instructions  either frora m or from Mr W until ay roturn.

In turn could be made trie basis of  a report to be sent back to the Swedish Section in London  I sad it abundantly clear to Mr Tennant that 1 felt the  iaplecsentotlon of any plans I was now laying would assess  rily be delayed for a considerable period of time X told  him frankly the basis on which ay planning was going for  ward was that of a loaf war and that if the war was to end  ssithin the next three to four months I did not believe so  should have accomplished very much I think he was somewhat  disappointed in my feeling that it would take sse so  long to establish ay alasion and got it going but X ex  plained to hiss the delays which I expected to encounter  before getting my men posted in the field sad the time X  believed it would take them to work into their cover job  before they could turn la effective results   ClEHEHAh KSKTING   llm day before X left there was General Moeting of  ell the SOS representatives with whom X had ted Independentconversation at which it was agreed that r Tennant and  Mr t would draw up a final document which would bo sent  back to London incorporctiag alithe general reports which  I had requested the various Section Chiefs to make Mb a the  statement was made we were all in agreement that the SO miss  ion in Stockholm would furnish and supplement the SOI work  X eagres ted that rlsupplement was an inadequate word and that  it should readt ' supplement and complament 3QE activities  beenua X felt we were going to develop new lines -partic  ularly into Ftnlnnd and the Baltic States vdilch could not b, for para military activitiaa la Denmark during D-day I  eKplai tS timt tide plea was only a tentativa on and  that Commander H m.& carrying' on negotiation with CaptainCroasell in London on tula subject but that in any case  it was early profitably to discuss the matter at this  tlUiS   Mr T then indicated that there were tao epecificthings that he felt our Stockholm Mission could do to ass  ist hia and supplement hia Danish cork The first of  these wee th atabliehoeat of aa agent at Malta . who would  act as th local SO/dOK representative vho would pick upand transmit messages to Stockholm who would Interview and  instruct travellers end who would help 1olea insofar as he   was able to help them He said he hoped he could eatabliah  another mn. at ikilainpborg who could train in the tJ E with  on of the SOiS Dane with whom labor he could communicate  freely by means of d-phone The first of tiles agents he  felt could be attached es a clerk to our Consulate in MoIso  but in order to place th second he suggested it would b  necessary for us to open a Vic Consulate in Helaingborg  and itf-ve this agent appointed as Vico Consul tiiere 1 told  him that there were t o people m.om e bed recruited L end  J whoa 1 thought would be suitable and available for these  positions providing I could got consent fro tii Minister  to make the appointments I explained to hia that L mss  already trained and would shortly be on bis my to the U &  but that J was merely recruited in the sense that a had  agreed to take an 80 position in Sweden if it were offered  hits but that so far as I knew he had not yet been sont to  our training school.

He makes this reference   to the Vestfield Mission in his forwarding   note     The co-operation received from  the Westfield Mission was of  the best and it was only the  fact that both Missions were  in a neutral country that   prevented integration. The  personal relationships with the  Westfield Mission were also  excellent .   S, ARCHIVES    5  FILE NUMBER SUBJECT  SOE/SCAMDINAVIA 7 OSS MISSION TO NORWAY  ANT DENMARK  VOLUME  FROM 1943  TO 1945  RS 7 91214, . / 6 lc   mi   1943  SO MISSION IN SWEDEN   The SO Brsnoh has considered the wisdom and ooseibillties of  establishing a Mission in Sweden. The purpose of this paper is to  present the merits of such an undertaking from the SO viewpoint and  the ways and means whereby it may be suooesafully aocompllahed.    The responsibilities of the 30 Branch set forth in Jeneral Order  Ho. 9 have served as guide and limitations for the Mission's activity.  The question therefore which we have constantly tried to keep in mind  is whether or not the Mission can actually produce the results expected  from the SO Branch in the Scandinavian Theatre. If it can and does its  purpose would be Justified and its merits established.   In order to successfully Initiate and carry out special operations  inside Scandinavia we must have certain information that will enable  intelligent planning of such operations. Furthermore we must set the   for such operations inside JJesndinairia snd particularly the oc    Wpied countries of Norway and Seraaark. The information we will require  is of a dual nature -that which by its existence suggests an effective  military operation and that which affords the knowledge which guides  intelligent planning of the operation.  The setting of the at-ge is a job of preparation performed at or  close to the sedne of potential operations. It is the effort which  prepares our Allies psychologically and physically for the impact of  special operations and for their responsibilities during the execution  of such operations. With this premise also In mind we list hereunder  the results which may be reasonably expected from the SO Branch through   j k i   ' tifTF    3f f-% % r   o %%4-J /, w -li  lts Mission In the Scandinavian Theatre. The comment should be made.  however that although these results fall within the pattern of the  general responsibilities of the 80 Branch thy represent only our  Judgment as to needs. These may be cancelled modified or confirmed  by American British soft Norwegian authorities abroad depending upon  the experience they have had as a consequence of direct and intimate    Intact with the Situation as it now prevails in this Theatre. Each  of th results are broken down in turn to include a number of contri  buting factors which likewise seem essential to the prosecution of our  responsibilities as an SC Branch.  R&SULTS TO BE EXPKGTlfi   1. Provide operational intelligence for eventual use of Operational  Groups in Norway or Denmark.  a.  Vulnerable and crucial target data.  b. Terrain and meteorological data for landing and continued  operations.  o. Degree and nature of cooperation to be expected from  Underground forces.  d.  Estimate of enemy resistance  tl Personnel -equipment   2  Enemy battle order.  2. Provide any additional Intelligence that may be of value to the  general military or political war effort.  a. Such as may be specially requested from time to time by the  Allies with respect to Scandinavia Sweden Norway or Denmark  b.  Such as may be encountered dur ance of routine  UUUUL. I   and  speelal duties   ho, and Norwegian Underground leadership and forees.    a. Provide assurance of American cooperation and participation  in special operations in Scandinavia.   1 To insure coordination among divergent sections of  the Underground forces.  4. Smploy the established Underground leadership forces and faci  lities.  a. To coordinate plans and military operations.  b. To provide communication chain to and from occupied  territory.   1 For transmittal of instructions materiel and  intelligence.  o. To organise potential guerilla groups inside occupied  territory.  d. To equip underground forces and secret armies with weapons  ammunition explosives and food.   1 Arrange for time olnoe and personnel to receive  supplies.  e. To prepare areas and reception committees for Operational  Groups.  f. To arrange through conscripted labor for special sabotage  inside Germany.  5. Establish a communication system for transmittal of Instructions  and Intelligence from and to GO Headquarters In London.  a. Through the State Department agencies.  b. By direct radio.  0. By courier., 4    6. determine operational asslatsnee be obtained from  refugee groups in Sweden.  a. As out-outs cell systems seeret armies or oouriers for  use in occupied territory.  The ways and means for accomplishing the afore-mentioned results  Mn best be explained perhaps by concrete answers to the questions      What is needed to do the Job  Have w such facilities available  How is the Job to be done  Under the first question we shall consider personnel over and    equipment training facilities and finances.  Personnel.    The ideal qualifications for the personnel required for this Mission  would in our judgment include a background of familiarity with Scandinavia.  This comprises an understanding of the psychology of its people the     spective temperaments of the swedes Morweglans and Panes the reason  underlying current national policy the evolution of the political and  military situation since the beginning of the war in 19S and at least a  speaking knowledge of the languages. In addition a possession of the  qualities of resourceful leadership will be required together with alert  mental and physical faculties and the abilities needed for performing a  task inconspicuously efficiently and speedily. Furthermore personnel    should possess all those abilities which are required to fully sustain  a cover.    Five specially qualified and trained men are considered sufficient  for the work Involved. If necessary others may be added later. A leader  should be designated and vested with full authority to carry out the        responsibilities of the Mission., the personnel required and possessing the qualifications enttoned   aboTc are now being recruited   Go ver   A legitimate cover that would permit a freedom of movement with a   mlniffiuin of suspicion is essential. Service with certain accredited   AiaericM' agei oiee would provide such a cover. Personnel for this Mission   intended to serve in Sweden under cover of an American agency accredi   ted by the Swedish CKJvernr cnt. Agreement has been reached in principle   with officials of the Office of war Information whereby the agency would   accent the personnel ostensibly as its employees indoctrinate them in   its practices and arrange for their dispatch to Sweden via London.   Training Facilities.   OSl reoroeentatives for this Mission will require special training   in espionage t .a cell system sabotage organisation and operating   methods of the Gestapo and the Swedish Security Police the use of small   ar s unarmed corsb&t technique of interrogation and of evaluation of  information. In addition the men will need training In the schools ahd  offices of the covering agney as indoctrination in the practice pro      eedure and purposes of the agency. The facilities for the above train   ing are now availsble.   UMMM   The supply of funds for the payroll will be provided by the   covering agency in accordance with customary procedure and practice with   respect to its employees. Additional funds which say be required for   operational purposes will also be supplied by' the agency through its   own channels. OSS will reimburse the  agency periodically for all   moneys expended for the eompeneatlon and support of the Mission re   presentatives., ffe answer to the qaeetion of how the Job Is to be done concern    Itself with the operating technique of the Mission    fhe strictest security measures apply to the personnel and    the nature of their assignment. Although each-of the members and their    respeetiw responsibilities will be known to the others the Chief alone    will know the identities of the liaison leadership of the British and     prwegian Underground. Each operator shall b permitted to seeretiy    employ and build aroUnd himself by means of out-outs and other implementa    of the cell system such personnel as may be required to aid In the    execution of instructions fhe entire pattern however for such employ   sent shall be created and released by the leader after consultation with    and approval by the British and Norwegian liaison chiefs. And all    \    personnel so employed must be checked for loyalty and officially approved.    Upon receipt of information instructions or materiel for release from    Sweden to occupied territory the Mission member will pass the same    Jihrough output or cell channels to the terminal point fhe reliability   P d loyalty of the ultimate recipient must be unquestionably vouched for.    The flow of information instructions and materiel from occupied    territory to Sweden will be channelled is reverse through established    underground contacts to the cutouts to the Mission members then to the    terminal point -the leader of the Mission.    Each member will be assigned an operating area In Sweden which will    include the adjacent occupied territory. He will conduct himself In a    manner eonslatent with the requirements of his cover. He will refrain    from intimate contact with other members of the Oil staff and will    maintain separate living quarters. The men will be br uefe .prelInInarlly    In this country but finally In England., OFFICE OF  STRATEGIC SERVICES    F.TOUSA    SUBJECT  fteatfield mission.    tO  Colonel Joseph F.Haskell  C.O. 30 OSS ETOUSA    1. The Report as submitted by Chief of Westfield was  intended as a reply to our request for lnfon tlon which would  enable us to appraise the worth of the Mission we wished to  determine specifio&llyta.  Actual results achieved which have Injured the  enemy.  b. The Mission s prospects for the future  c. The Mission a personnel supplies and financial  requirements for continued operations.  2. Nothing contained In the above mentioned Report can  properly be labelled as results which have actually Injured the  enemy.  3. The activities of the Mission  in the field have consisted of establishing itself and making  preparations for certain future'operstions  4. The Westfield Mission was  intended as a vigorous operating unit months before the organ  ization was in the field namely on 1 July 1943 we wrote down the  list of results to be accomplished. This paper is In the  Washington office files and a copy was given to t he now Chief .  of fteetfiold as a guide before he returned to London to activate  the plan.  5. We believe there has been a misconception regarding  the original purpose as well as the possibilities of the Mission.  Moreover we believe thnt a substantial degree of ingenuity and  initiative could have been employed by the Mission in the direct  ion of achieving concrete results. The past general attitude of  Westfield to look to London at every turn for guidance and  plans was unnecessary and resulted in a lack of definite action        6. This  misinterpretation and practice should have been, noticed as well as discouraged. Unfortunately the officer in  charge of Westfield activity from London Hq was unable to cope  with the situation. An indifferent attitude on the part of  London ttq aggravated the condition this officer has since been  relieved and a definite future policy of relationship between  London and Westfield has ben established.     . In order to avoid a continuance of a misconception of  either the purpose or the responsibilities of the Mission simple  Directives dealing with Norway Denmark Finland and Germany  have been issued and approved. Westfield is instructed to  accomplish by any means it can find or devise certain specific  objectives. A few and clearly stated control measures provide  the only limits to Westfield s being on its own to develop and  strike.    8. ffwhavedeterminedthelilacion erequirementsasto  personnel supplies arid funds fhese will be met with any  resources that are available.  9. Allowance of funds is limited to a 3 nonths period./  At the end of that time the work of the organisation will be  re-appraised.  10. There Is only one philosophy of action that can be  maintained so far as opsratlons in Scandinavia go today. It Is  one of speed and drive.  11. The Chief of the Mission has been Informed accordingly  and we expect the Mission s fullest appreciation of this fact.

JAMES R. FORGAB  Colonel GSO  Commanding., c    0    p.t. London  High Command  28 April 1944  ROYAL NORWEGIAN FORCES    2nd Department.    F.O. Jnr. 1177/44 II  TO    Colonel D.K.E. Bruce  Office of Strategic Services  70 Grosvenor Street W.l.    Dear Colonel Bruce    For some time since the establishment of the Norwegian High  Command in London an officer from your office. Lieutenant Fossel  has been engaged on intelligence work in close co-operation with  F.O.II the Norwegian Intelligence Department and in addition  has provided the channel for liaison with the 0.8.8. on such  matters.    The work thus undertaken has proved of considerable value  and in view of the general preparations at present being made  for the re-investment of Europe it would seem advisable to  consider the desirability of this arrangement being continued  during the re-investment of Norway and the ensuing period. During  the period of military operations and thereafter there will be a  considerable work of an intelligence nature concerning the  American British and Norwegian authorities much of it undoubtedly  of direct interest to the O.S.8. and it would seem advantageous  therefore that the present arrangement be continued also in the  period mentioned above.    Once Norway has been regained it will be necessary for the  Norwegian High Command to undertake a full scale investigation of  German Activities in Norway involving the exhaustive examination  of archives and files the inspection of construction work and  so forth. This is a matter which can only satisfactorily be done  on th8 spot by persons with local knowledge and any attempts to  split the work by removing the archives and files to England would  only lead to confusion. Nevertheless many of the findings of  xhe investigation will undoubtedly be of considerable interest to  the U.S. and Allied Nations' intelligence systems and it would  be the function of the various American units tvorking in co  operation with the Norwegian High Command to insure that these  matters are brought to the notice of their respective authorities.    In the circumstances it is assumed that the OSS may wish  due to his familiarity with the Norwegian situation that  Lieutenant Fossel continue ills present Cunction and accompany the  Norwegian High Command when it returns to Norway. It vrould be  appreciated if this could be confirmed.    It should be ad .ed that a similar inquiry is being made in  respect to other American and British Institutions working in  conjunction with the Norwegian Intelligence authorities.

Reference your letter dated 12th September 1944 requesting  authority for the attachment of OSS personnel to the Supreme  Headquarters AEF Missions.    1. The functions of the  directives to the Heads of the missions of which copies are  attached herewith. You will note that the missions have no  executive authority independent of this Headquarters. It is  therefore considered undesirable for the missions to have in  dependent intelligence and counter-espionage groups attached to  them particularly in view of the unacknowledgeable nature of  certain OSS activities.  2. It is however recognised that it is highly desirable  for OSS groups to be established in each liberated country in  Supreme Headouarters AEF sphere. It is understood that you are  already established in PARIS there is consequently no special  arrangement required in that city. The heads of your BELGIAN  NETHERLANDS and LUXEMBOURG groups should contact the Supreme  Headquarters AEF missions in these countries prior to making  the necessary administrative arrangements with the local military  commander. The present address of these missions is given at  Appendix A . Similar directions will be given on the mobilization  of the Supreme Headquarters AEF raissions' to DENMARK and NORWAY.  3. These OSS groups will report direct to the appropriate  Division of this Headquarters keeping the Missions informed.  4.
