NO ONE REPEAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW OF THIS GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT 5o GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COMMENT, THE O.S.S. MISSION TO MOSCOW  General DONOVAN arrived in Moscow on 24th December for preliminary discussions with the Soviet as to the advisability of sotting up an O.S.S. Mission In Moscow. Since it may be that the germ of this idea originated from S.O.K. I set down the facts herewith chronologically   1 Colonel HILh a meeting with O.S.S. London  On 4th October 1943 Colonel HILL accompanied by Major HEDLEY DENT and Major SPDBON had an interview with Colonel VAN DEB BLUE and Lieut.-Colonel HASKELL at O.S.S. Headquarters in London. Colonel HILL gave a brief resume' of the functions of the S.O.E. Mission in Moscow and expressed his great desire to have a similar O.S.S. Mission in Moscow working In the closest possible collaboration with him. He gave it as his opinion that Britain and America should pool their resources in Russia since he envisaged a considerable amount of work in & joint forward plan. He considered that this would be a good means of preparation for a possible breach between Russia and Japan in which case the 0 S.S. control in China could be utilised for a single plan In which Russia would particl pate.  Colonel VAN DER BLUE explained that 0.3.S had done practically nothing with regard to Russia and that the American policy was rather' to hold their hand but he said that after hearing Colonel BILL'S remarks he was Interested and would pass the suggestion on to Washington. He said that in approaching the Russian problem they had been faced with many difficulties the chief of which was the State Department's refusal to consider American repre sentation in Moscow.   2 Preliminary Conversations with American Ambassador On 17th December HILL had a talk with HARRIMAN during ... /,  2during which the Ambassador informed him that DOMOVAM and HASKELL were coming to Moscow at Ms request and he expected them to arrive almost immediately. He asked HILL what his reactions would be to having an American colleague in Moscow and HILL told Mm that he would wel come it and repeated what he had told VAN DEE BLUE in October. HARHIMAH then asked HILL if he could advise how best to approach the Russians and HILL replied that he considered the approach should be made on the highest level in order to allow the Kremlin to digest such pro posals as he might make. HILL then referred to a con versation which he had had with General DEANE head of the American Military Mission and from which he gathered that the American Embassy was opposed to G.S.5. representation in Moscow but HARRIEAN explained that the Teheran Conference had altered his opinion and that as a result of G.S.S a successful operations in the Mediterranean he thought that there was yet scope for collaboration with the Russians and British In the Balkans. HILL replied that fa thought the preparations for the Balkans were so far advanced that it would be difficult to draft a new plan based on equal representation by the three nations. HARR MAN continued that the Yugoslav question had been discussed with MOLOTOV at Teheran and that the latter had said h would Ilk to send a military mission to til partisans and was also ready to do the same to MIHAJLOVIC and further that MOLOTOV had expressed the opinion that it would b wrong for the Allies to discard M1HAJL0VIC until it was absolutely clear that he could no longer help their cause. HILL stated that It would take some time for an G.S.S. representative to acclimatise himself in Moscow but that he would be only too willing to help him to the limit of his power. Osneral DEANE observed that any O.S.S. Mission in Moscow would come under Ma jurisdiction.    3 /, -3   3 DONOVAH a Visit to Moscow  DONOVAN and HASKELL arrived in Moscow on the 23rd Decoiaber and they had a preliminary interview with KILL on the same evening at which KARRIMAN was also present. At DOSOV/iN fs invitation HILL gave hi a opinion as to whet the preliminary moves in the N.S.S.R. should be and out lined the policy dictated to liim by S.O.S. DONOVAN stated that there had been genuine dlfflour't &a between 0 3.L. and 8.0.E but that these had been composed to a large extent after his conversations with C.D. in Cairo. However he was insistent that 0.3.S. was now fully fledged and capable of playing its part unaided. Ee con sidered that the C.S.S.R. was not being given anything like adequate representation by Great Britain and the U.3.A. in the Balkans a policy which he denounced as stupid and dangerous. Be commented bitterly on the British refusal to allow 0.3.3. to operate from India and talked at length on the latest reorganisation of 0.S. . in China of which he stated 5.O.E. is fully informed.  On the following day the conversations were resumed and DONOVAN after explaining the functions of 0.3 3. said he proposed to tell the Russians of his readiness to exchange information and to collaborate on the same lines as he did with the British namely on a reciprocal basis. 1 gave details of the stores which 0.3 3. had shipped to the Yugoslav patriots and implied that he expected this traffic to assume great proportions. After the meeting HILL Informed his N.K.V.B. colleague that DOMBVAN wished to have an interview and on the following day DONOVAN and MERIMAW had a 45-aj.n.uts interview with MOLOTOV at which MOLOTOV stated that he would give Chair proposals Ms urgent attention.  On 27th December a masting took place between DONOVAN    01 TINE chief of th Soviet Intelligenc at the Lubianka'  and .. /, -4   and our H.K.V.D colleague. Colonel OSSIPOV. Hiere were also present at the meeting General MAKE and Mr. 80MLKM of the U.S Embassy. The Interview was very cordial and lasted over an hour and the Russians stated that they welcomed the principle of collaboration with America and asked DONOVAN to send a representative to Moscow to study its possibilities. DONOVAN said he would like to send Colonel HASKELL if acceptable to which the H.E.V.D. agreed.  On 28th December HILL had another interview with DONOVAN and HASKELL during which the following points were brought out by DONOVAN he had stressed to the Russians the good coordination that O.S.S. had with S.O.E. but also mentioned that they had had their differences and ended by saying that he hoped that they might have a similar tie-up with the Russians. Immediately after the Russians had agreed to the principle DONOVAN explained in detail how  O.S.S. functions from which the Russians immediately realised that an O.S.S. representative in Moscow would also be concerned with S.I.S. and secret propaganda matters. He explained to the N.K.V.D. that British and American activities were well established in the Balkans and stressed the part being played by O.S.S. in sea transport. He con tinued that it was his opinion that Russia should enter this combine as an equal partner and that it would be possible for assistance to be given to them to introduce stores to the Balkans. They discussed the information which President ROOSEVELT had given to MOLOTOV on the TITO situation but it is doubtful whether DONOVAN explained to them that all activities in the Mediterranean area had to be coordinated through the Commander-in-Chief. No concrete suggestions seem to have been mad with regard to Greece or Roumanla but DONOVAN stressed O.S.S. inde pendence in Bulgaria and generally commented on British lack of interest making a serious plea that O.S.S. and N.K.V.D. should collaborate there closely and took pains to .../, -5   to davslop his ideas as to hos the problem should be   tackled.   Discussion took place with regard to the exchange of technical information end equipment and DOT 0VAN was not at all bashful in stressing the essistance which   0.2.3. could give in this respect. Iha quaslion of chemical warfare was not raised but subversive propaganda in which the Russians showed great interest was touched on and DO'S0VAN promised to put the N.X.V.& in touch with the appropriate department of G.3.S. He also urged HILL to contact S R WAK with a view to collaboration.  4 HILL S Cofliffients on the Visit HILL tried to draw out 0SSIP0V as to his reactions to the DONOVAN visit but was unsuccessful and 0SSIF0Y seemed disinclined to refer to DONOVAN at all. HILL is very much of the opinion that the N.K.V.B. aim st keeping the two organisations in watertight compartments but does not think this is a bad thing so long aa a close S.0.E./0.S.S. liaison is maintained via-a-vis the K.K V.D. A last-Minute request frore DONOVAN through diplomatic channels for an IntrSciuctlon-between HASKELL and OSSIPOV for further dlscuaaions was entirely ignored by the N.K.V.D.    5 S.O.r . Comsuants It would upp-sar in general that DONOVAN s visit to Moscow resulted largely in a disclosure to the N.R.7.D of the 0.3.3. organisation unaccompanied by any undue modesty aa to their powers and that fen return he received from the   H.K.Y.D. practically nothing except their agreement to the principle of collaboration and their permission for O.S.S. to send a representative for preliminary talks. It would also appear that should such a mission be set up it will operate entirely within its own four walls and that HILL s original desire for a united 0.2.S./S.O.E. front in dealing with the N.K.V.B is not likely to be realised unless action is taken on a high level before the establishment of the OSS Mission, AD/1069 TOs K/PQL Copy to C.D.   V/CD    With reference to your K.POL/li of January 4 I attach hereto a memorandum on the activities of General DONOVAN in MOSCOW so far as we know them which has been compiled by our Russian Section on the basis of telegrams received from our MOSCOW Mission, DP/RU/1839. 6th January 1944. To From D/p.   With reference to our conversation of last evening I send you herewith memorandum on the DONOVAN tragedy., MDSBGW. 11th January 1944 MC2 S2.6 //jl V     YOUR 1397.   1. We approve your suggestion. 2. We are taking up on high level here and will advise you as soon as action by you is required. r   Origin A.D. Class C., I'i   11th January 1944   TO D/P. FROM- A.D.   This is O.D 's decision regarding SAM'S suggestion. On O.D.'s instructions I am going to see Colonel Bruce myself about it and will let you know result as soon as possible., DP/RU/1912. 24til February 1944. To A.D. From D/P.101. 4  In reference to my telegram from Moscow No.1397 of 8.1.44. about our giving O.S.S. Mission when it arrives in Moscow our W/T facilities we were promised in your 3267 of 11.1.44 a reply which we never received I still think that it is very desirable that we should offer these services.   I raise the matter now as I think Colonel HASKELL will be on his way to Moscow very shortly and may arrive during my absence. If this is so and the policy advocated by me is approved I am anxious that D/P.103 should make the gesture to Colonel HASKELL on his arrival. g aXo, f jj. ZPl'ob  DP/RIJ/1911. 24th February 1944.   From New York's telegram No.1519 of 15th February it is clear that DONOVAN'S organisation is becoming interested in S.O.E. 's set-up with N.K.V.D.      I think it is mpst important that we should not introduce our London Soviet contact to our American colleagues. Nor/Should we put Colonel HASKELL G.50 736 in touch with DPR.l when he passes through London on his way to Moscow even if he asks us to do so for he is keen on every form of penetration. But this is not my reason for advising the above policy.   My reason is that Moscow General OSSIPOV has shown very clearly that it wishes to keep the British and American S.O.E. organisations in water-tight com partments .   The N.K.V.D. runs their counterpart to our organi sation on a strictly secret basis. Therefore they would be likely to resent our disclosing to the Americans our Soviet contacts in London. Moreover I see no need at present for an American-Russian tieup in London the liaison will be Moscow-Washington.   I agreed with General DONOVAN when he was in Moscow that in view of the N.K.V.D. attitude I should meet HASKELL no more than I do any other American officers and that we would be careful to have no out ward cooperation while endeavouring to keep eachother informed for our mutual benefit.   I consider the real cooperation between S.O.E. and O.S.S. vis-a-vis the N.K.V.D. should be built up between London and Washington. For some months to come it is unlikely that there will be any need for   much coordination for it will I am confident take Colonel HASKELL considerable time to settle down., NEW YORK V-V-/ 26.1.44   G.M. from A.D. 1. Shortly after G.50 000 s departure from MOSCOW SAM suggested to us we should offer proposed G. 40 000 Mission MOSCOW use of our channel which is in fact C's. secret l/T for their traffic in their own cyphers. Reason for this was that all U.S.A. Authorities in MOSCOW have to use Soviet Telegraph office which has obvious drawbacks. 2. We see no objection to these proposals and Z.P. whom we have consulted also agree. 3. We put suggestion to G.50 21 who recommended that as G.50 000 was expected visit LONDON on way back to WASHINGTON from NORTH AFRICA we should wait and discuss it with him. 4. We shall still do this if he comes but if he does not we shall ask you to discuss in WASHINGTON5. Above is intended to keep you in the picture and for any comments and requires no action for present. flass G., V/  %  COK  CIPHER TEL TO NEW Y'RK 27a1 44 CO 1 'p/Oi ro  2764  QtF 1 FROM A.D '  1 SHORTLY AFTER 050 000 S DEPARTU E FROM MOSCOW SAP SUQOESTED TO US 'K-OFFEf PROPOSED 040 000 M TSfON MOSCOW USE OF OUR CHANNEL WHICH IS IN FACT C'S SECR T U/T FOR THEIR TRAFFIC IN THEIR OWN CYPHERS REASON WAS ALL U .

Your letter SC/1046/51 of March 21st.   The withdrawal of our Mission from Belgrade would not necessarily involve the departure of O'Malley from Budapest. We want O'Malley to remain at his post as long as possible and unless the behaviour of the Hungarian Government under German pressure should change considerably for the worse the present position need not be modified. Of course if the Germans were to suspect that O'Malley's presence in Budapest was of great use to us they would soon enough devise ways and means of bringing pressure to bear to obtain his withdrawal. S.O E. are I am sure aware of this danger and will see that their plan does not in any way compromise the Legation. I presume that the plan would not involve any additions to the Legation staff which would be impossible or an increase in the number of couriers to and from the Legation which would arouse suspicion.   On this understanding we have no objection to   S.O.E. going ahead with their plan. They will no doubt keep O'Malley informed of what they are doing and take account of any views he may have.

Palairet Athens   dated 13th March 1941.   No. 3001.   E. Bailey made favourable contact Minister Moscow during latter's visit Ankara and believe that he might accept S.O. man on his staff Moscow which he is now enlarging. If you want this followed up please telegraph Bailey at Cairo and am informed arranging to put any proposition you wish to Cripps informally. If answer is favourable you can then finalise with Foreign Office. -oOo, copy A  27.3.41. RUSSIA   It is increasingly indicated from P.0 telegrams and other sources that action by Germany against Russia is not outside the bounds of possibility. Furthermore it would appear that there is some -admittedly slight -chance of a rapprochement between the U.S.S.R. and this country.   Taylor in referring to Bailey s conversation with H.M. Ambassador Moscow gave us to understand that the former v/as not opposed to the idea of an S.O. representative being appointed to the Embassy at Moscow.   It is clear that at the moment there is little likelihood of any positive reaction being obtained from the Soviet Government as regards co-operation with them in subversive   activities directed against the Axis Powers.   On the other hand we should be considering the possibility of sending some one to the Moscow Embassy with foolproof diplomatic cover who knows our ways aims and objects   and could at the appropriate moment put himself in touch with the competent body at the Kremlin. It would be clearly a case of placing someone out there in cold storage until the psychological moment arrived.   The first step is to ascertain suitable candidates. At present I have only one namely Mr. MICHAEL VYVYAN who   is recommended to me by the Foreign Office and who is now   serving as a Lieutenant in the Black Watch. The C.E.O. knows VYVYAN well as he was in the Foreign Office and had a stage at Moscow.   There is another possibility and that is a certain Major HUGH CURTIS who was formerly with M.I.R. is an officer in the H.L.I. speaks Russian and was on the Polish Mission. Gubbins knows him well and I was discussing with him the other day whether he would perhaps be a suitable represent ative in a position such as A.M.A.   I would be glad if you could discuss this with the C.E.O. and at your discretion with the Minister who I should imagine might take some interest in a possible relationship with the Soviet Union.   -0O0, ADl/RIJ/987 TO C.E.O   31 MAR 1341  SC.9i   30.3.41. Prom A/Dl. I attach at A a note from A/DZ to C/D in regard to Russia.   2. You will remember that in a telegram to C/D of which I also attach a copy at B A/D stated that D/H2 had recently met Sir S. Cripps who seemed to regard favourably the idea that an S.O. man might be appointed to the Moscow Embassy. 3. Prom our point of view this would have two important advantages  i Itwould enable us to explore the real possibilities of S.O. work in Russia. Of these we can really have very little idea at this end and it has been our experience in the past that once we have a man in position all sorts of possibilities of action present themselves which did not appear before.    ii It would enable us to establish an alternative base for communications with the Balkans in the event of our lines with that part of the world being cut by a G-erman drive to the South. This was referred to in A/D s telegram to C/D of which a copy is attached at G. The letter to you from Mr. Hopkinson attached at D shows that even if Yugoslavia is overrun the P.0 intend to maintain the mission at Budapest. 4. We therefore feel that it is worth our while to attempt to get an S.O. man into the Embassy at Moscow and shall be grateful if you will be kind enough to ask the P.0 whether they would consider telegraphing to Sir S. Cripps asking him whether he would accept an S.O. officer in this Embassy and if so under what cover. -oOo, NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.   Registry No. SC/85  Draft. Letter.

Mr. Sweet Escqtt and I took this paper down to the Foreign Office to our weekly meeting hut unfortunately there was not time to go into it fully. Our intention of course was merely to ascertain the preliminary reactions of the Northern Department.  Before approaching the Foreign Office formally we must of course take a decision in principle as to whether it is advisable for us to extend our activities to U.3.S.R. I think that it is essential that we should have something laid on. It is quite possible that any officer appointed to Moscow would have little to do for some time but he would be able to explore the ground and he would be instantly available when the moment came for action.  I suggest that a letter might be sent to Sir A. Cadogan on the lines of the attached draft which embodies the points made in the attached papers.  As regards possible candidates for the post in question I only have personal knowledge of Mr. Michael Vyvyan. He has a good knowledge of conditions in Russia where he travelled extensively during the time that he was attached to the Embassy.

Overt propaganda remains purely a matter for the Ministry of Information. The conduct of the above two sections is under the   supervision of officials appointed from the Foreign Office. A new officer from outside has been appointed in place of the officer in charge of S.0.2. the old Section D and this section which is responsible for the actual carrying out of plans under the heading 2 above is being completely over hauled. It will include all the activities hitherto performed by M.I.R. except for M.I.R. Middle East which for the present remains under the General Officer Commanding in Chief.

S. and S.O. is not clear to you.  2. The two organisations are entirely separate. S.I S. is concerned only with the collection of intelligence. S.O.  see my telegram No. 883 of 1940 is concerned with subversive activities such as sabotage contact with dissident groups and covert as opposed to overt propaganda. 3. Proposal in my telegram No. 415 does not therefore affect question of Proposal is that S.O. representativeshould be attached to your staff so that he may become familiar with the local situation may form an idea of the possibilities of action as a later stage and will be on the spot if action \by his organisation is required. 4.. We feel that if the Soviet Union were to disrupt as a result of a German attack S.O. might do a lot to hamper German control and organisation of occupied territory. But as stated no action would be taken or contacts made now and you would be consulted before anything is done..  5.

Your telegram No. 415 appeared to me to imply clearly so far as the U.S.S.R. was concerned work proposed to the S.O. officer here would not he normal S.O. work in that it would merely he co-operative with Soviet Secret Service with a view to disruptive activities in or secret communications with third countries e.g. the Balkans or Near Eastern States.  3. Your telegram No. 442 foreshadows however a very different form of activity namely disruptive work here in the event of a German occupation. 4. Nevertheless provided that work is to he performed in strict liaison with the Soviet Secret Service organisations I should see no objection to such an officer being appointed to my staff. 5. In saying this. I assume that his instructions would in no ease he interpreted as authorising him to work against the Soviet regime as long as the Soviet remained in power however friendly it might become to Germany. 6. I should add however that the Soviet viwa may very well prove unobtainable unless some preliminary semi-official understanding with the Soviet Secret Service has been reached and as indicated in my telegram No. 453-I should be glad to learn definitely whether this is the case. 7. As it is now clear that appointment has nothing to do with this question I must ask for a definite assurance that he is not expected to perform any S.I.S. v/ork in addition to his official duties in connexion with evacuation of non-British refugees. My consent to his appointment was on this understand ing and I had never contemplated the presence here of an officer of the Committee of Imperial Defence collecting intelligence about the U.S.S.R. as distinct from performing liaison work approved bv the.

Cripps to co-operate though there are still one or two points which he has failed to grasp in spite of the fact that they should have been clear from the wording of the tele grams which were sent to him.   One misunderstanding must be our fault namely the reference to a semi-official understand ing with the Soviet Secret Service. I have never seen any report from any of our sources that any such understanding was reached and indded it is most unlikely that this could have been the case. The impression which Sir S. Cripps has received must clearly be corrected.   I attach a draft telegram/for the reply to Moscow. The Foreign Office will of course have to add what is necessary with regard to para graphs 7 and 8 which are not of direct concern to us.   15th May 1941.

S.OjSLare grateful for your agreement in principle to accept an officer on your staff.  BJr  Condition in Paragraph 4 of your telegram could of course only come into operation If and when the Soviet authorities were ready to co-operate with us. It is we fear not the case that any preliminary semi-official understanding with the Soviet Secret Service Lias been readied. Indeed it would seem both dangerous and useless to attempt to get any such understanding just at present. The duties of the officer vdio would be sent out would therefore inevitably be light for the time being. V.hat we want however is to make sure of liaving a man on the spot ready for the opportunity if it comes. As emphasised in my telegram No. 442 you would be consulted before any action taken.  2. The officer would proceed to his post as ap. -.imry member of your staff in any suitable capacity which you would recoiamend. illis being thqo. yl.. hap difficulties v/ould not arise. 3. I fully appreciate anxiety expressed in paragraph 9 of your telegram that the greatesl care should be exercised in choice of officer to be appointed. Suitable candidates are admitted ly not many. 5.0.2. will examine the field most carefully and the name of their candidate will be telegraphed to you with his qualifica tions in order that you may be able to comment before he is appointed., 15 MAY 1941  15.5.41.

Cripps came to see me and stayed for nearly ail hour I asked when he was going back and he said WPerhaps in a few days or perhaps not at all 1 If war came between Russia and Germany it might be physically very difficult to get back and it might not really be worthwhile since all that would serve any useful purpose then would be a good British Military Mission with the Russians .   He was sure that Hitler would very soon -probably within a few days -give Stalin an ultimatum. It would depend on the teaana of this whether Russia fought or gave way. He thought the test would be whether the terms   would be such as to make it impossible for Russia to come into the war against Germany at a later stage. Thus if Hitler demanded that the Russian Army should be demobilised Russia would fight if he only demanded an evacuation of the Ukraine and even of the oil fields Russia might accept. But he thought that Hitler wanted to fight the Russians so as to dispose of any military menace in the East and to free -all his forces for an attack on us before the Autumn Therefore Cripps thought. Hitler would deliberately pitch his terms too high for Russian acceptance. He did not believe that there were any serious German-Russian talks going on at this moment though it was possible that Hitler s ultimatum might lead to a quick talk between him and Stalin.   Cripps thought that the Russians would probably be finished in a month though he had no solid evidence to put forward in support of this opinion. He thought that the Japs already subjected to very heavy pressure by the Germans to come into the war would do so if the Russians were attacked.   He thought that Hitler was counting and rightly on many people in this country and still more in the U.3. especially the anti-Roosevelt and /all Street crowd becoming less unfriendly to the Nazis if they mopped up the Reds. This would have the effect he thought of slowing down Roosevelt s efforts and delaying if not preventing U.S. entry into the war. Also -and this was a separate point Lindbergh & Co. in the U S. and some people here would say Look The German War Machine is quite invincible. How can the war ever be won against Germany I said that I should rather welcome a few people coming out into the open with this song in this country. I should like to be able to denounce them publicly and I had no doubt that they could easily be discredited.   Cripps said he agreed but in theU.S. it might be much more serious since the Americans were very far from feeling themselves to-be at war.   He thought that what had finally incited Hitler against the Russians was their agreement with the Yugoslavs. This from the Russian point of view had been a great miscalculation. They had thought as so many others did that Yugoslavia would be able to put up an effective resistance. Had they done so -arid still more if a  firm Balkan front had been formed and theTurks had been   willing/, willing to come in on our side -he thought that WS Russians also would have come in against Germany. This had hefen a bad slip-up on MolotovIs part and was ode reason why Stalin had openly taken charge. The situation having become so critical for the Russians Stalin thought that-if there were decisions to be taken or talks to be held he had better take or hold them himaaLf. He would be best able to get away with it with such Russian opinion as counted Cripps also thought that if the Russians destroyed or drove off all their tractors and withdrew their key men from the collective farms and from the factories the result would be utter chaos which it would take the Germans a very long time to reorganise.   He thought that the foreign Office took too simple a view when they said that it would be to our advantage if the Russians came into the war. He thought it possible that if the Russians kept out and remained in reserve against the Germans for later on that this might suit us better. But it was ust for this reason that he believed that Hitler would force a fight now. ' He had foundT month after monthi great indecisi and long delays at the jPoreign Office. Prom Halifax he good never get decisions. He was doing very badly in America and would find it very difficult to persuade the Americans that it was still a good fight if the RussianReds were on our side I said that I had understood that Cripps and Halifax had'not onlvbeen great personal friends but that Cripps had excercised great influence upon the Viscount's political Outlook. Cripps fho is peculiarly lacking in any faintest approximation to the dimmest sense of humour did not seem to appreciate this point. I therefore passed on to ask him what he thought that we could do to help the Russians if the Germans attacked them He said thepe were three things we should do first to try to keep the Finns neutral second to furnish the Russians with really good military air and perhaps naval Staff advice and third to arrange for supplies'td reach them across Siberia probably from American sources 4 provided the Japs did not make this impossible. All questions of ar Trade Agreements etc. he thought now were.out of date. It would be a question either of supplying the Russians or of completely blockading them. There would be no middle course worth discussing He thought that they would accept Staff advice from us and had been speaking to Dill about this to-day. e must however send men who had names and had had practical experience of fighting in this war.  Regarding Finland I found him unconvincing. He wanted us to give Ryti and Mannerheim some cards to play against those Finns who would like to go in on the German side. He would like us to offer the Finns some supplies on condition that they remained neutral. I said that they were not neutral now since there were a number of divisions of German troops already quartered on their soil. He said that it did not matter so much if these German troops were in the north of Finland whence they were only able to attack Murmansk. What would be serious would be   if German troops attacked Leningrad through Finland. I said that I thought the Finns would act like the Hungarians and Bulgars and that the Germans would not, ask more of them than this. He said that it would anyhow be Important that the Finnish Army should not enter the war on the German side for if it did there would be a great wave of feeling in Sweden in favour of fighting against the Russians too I said that I did not believe this. The Swedes were neutrals to the marrow and as he himself said sentimentally pro-British. Nor did I see how in fact they could be used to fight the Russians even if they were willing. He said that the Germans might demand further rights of passage through Sweden. I said that might be so but it would not according to his views be a departure from neutrality. He thought that they might also have to give Gothland to the Germans but that they were prepared to do this rather   than fight against the Germans. I said I could make no commitment about the Finns. They had behaved badly were in my opinion already in the German pocket and we badly needed the ships so that this was an additional reason if we had no excuse for refusing to allow the Finnish ships now being detained to go through. I said however that without commitment I would look into the question further.   He ended by saying that he wished to congratulate me on the efficiency of M.E.W. Everybody he met said that it was one of the best organised of Government Departments. And one got decisions from us in 48 hours whereas it took the F.O. months to make up their minds.   I thanked him for these kind observations and thought that he had not yet lost the habit with which I was familiar of getting badly wrong on details in spite of an ability to paint a clear and striking picture in general terms.    intd H.D.   12.6.41, OPY   I discussed this problem with President Benes on May 17 and   19. His views can be summarised as follows - He has no faith in any Russian emigre movement.    II. The Tsarist emigres are pro-German partly because they believe in absolute government but mainly because Germany is their only hope. The new generation of Tsarist emigres born abroad is more absolutist and more Hitlerian in outlook than the preceding generation. The few Tsarist emigres who by special inclination are pro-British have no influence anu cannot alter the fundamental attitude of their monarchical compatriots.    Ill.Those emigres who belonged formerly to the Liberal   intelligentsia are now divided. Those who have remained Liberal are against interference in the internal affairs of Russia.   In this connexion first principles have been confirmed by the practical experience of 1918-1920 i.e. British intervention and British support of reactionary elements . The few activists among the former Social-Revolutionaries -Kerensky Zenzinoff etc.are scattered and have no influence.    IV.The Ukrainian emigres are also pro-German and have been supported and financed by Germany for a long time. German influence is far stronger here than on any other section of .Russian opinion. Any independent Ukraine that may be set up must be pro- German because the natural enemies of an independent Ukraine are Poland and Russia. '    V.The Caucasian peoples are outside the orbit of Czech knowledge and interest. But the same formula applies here. There is nothing to hope for from emigres who have been out of touch with the people of their country for nearly twenty-four years.    VI.Whatever changes may take place in Russia they will be made by the Russian people. In a world in which everything is possible the least probable contingencjr is that the Russian people of to-day will accept a lead from any emigre or any foreign organisation. Some of the social changes made by the Soviet Government are fundamental. They may be modified but there will be no re-turn to the past.    VII. If the Germans were to over-run large areas of Russia and were to set up reactionary emigr e administrations in the Ukraine and in Russia proper the Russian people would counter-attack with sabotage and assassination. This form of resistance would not benefit from the aid of emigre and still less of British  professional saboteurs.    VIII. Germany of course can establish emigre anti-Bolshevik   administrations in Russia. They can be destructive but not   constructive. They will certainly be unpopular. As we ourselves can take no effective physical steps to stop German action against Russia it is in our best interest to let Germany compromise herself to the extreme limit with the emigres who are despised and   discredited. We should keep clear of them.   2. Having bedn asked to ascertain the views of the Czechoslovak Government in this country my own comments may be out of place. But I should perhaps point out that the Czechs have no liking for Russian monarchists and indeed no reason to like the late Tsar. As/, As a peasant people they sympathise with and have a mystical belief which is occasionally if rarely justified by results   in the Russian people. Nor aoes President Benes believe that   the Russians would be easilj over-run by Germany or readily   accept anything in the nature of a German occupation.   5. Since the last war I have seen much of the various Russian emigre organisations in Europe and in America.v I assisted at the birth of the Young Russian movement which is now said to be in touch with the Poles and the Czechs. I have never thought much .of it. In the organisation there were a few energetic young men who were attracted by the dashing but rather bogus Fascist-monarchial ardour of Kazenbek Kasem-Beg and by the languid charm of the pale and effete Grand Duke Dmitri Pavolovitch who was the first sponsor of the movement. The Czechs who are realists are taking no seats in this life-boat. I make no comment on Polish-Russian co-operation this being outside my province if indeed not outside the realm of practical politics. 4. On the whole I share President Benes s views about emigres especially when they have been driven out not by a foreign enemy as in the case of the Czechs and Poles but by their own countrymen. The older generation of emigre is now too old. The younger generation has never set foot in Russia. Moreover the German conquest of Europe has played havoc with such Russian organisations .as previously existed. This applies in the first instance to the Mladoruss branches. There are doubtless some pro-ally elements among the Russians and Ukrainians in the United States but these pro-ally elements are mainly to be found among the American-born Russians and Ukrainians. The others are divided and in the spring of 1939 I was amazed to find how many of my own Russian friends in the States had had old hopes revived by Hitler. ' 5. I am therefore sceptical about the feasibility of these proposals. I doubt very much if we ourselves have the1 power  and the necessary experience to create any useful organisations or even to find pro-ally anti-Soviet elements inside Russia. We too have been cut off from all intercourse with the Russian people for twenty-three years. In 1918 we had an army of agents many of whom had great experience not only of Russia and the Russian language but also of sabotage and' of subversive activities. In circumstances far more favourable to such activities these agents failed badly. Are we likely to do any better to-day when the physical difficulties are far greater and we lack the necessary men of experience I think not. To-attempt to organise pro-ally anti-Soviet elements even in the most secret manner-is to ask for burnt fingers. Detection would be easy and moreover would give to Stalin a good excuse for any further surrenders to Germany which he may find necessary. Russia in fact has moved a long way from the idealism of.the Narodnaia Volya the aristocratic fervour of Sophia Perovskaia and the self-sacrifice of the terrorists of the seventies and eighties. Since 1920 no emigre organisation has ever succeeded even in keeping a secret and to insure against a possible re-birth of the former Russian passion for assassination M.Maisky has his agents in all emigre circles.   6. For these reasons I am in favour of allowing the Russian people to organise in the form v/hich history and geography seem to have assigned to them their own resistance to any possible German invasion  Signed R.H.Bruce Lockhart. L .i gioth May 194i.-, &   You will remember that at the meeting held in Sargent s room on 29th April to discuss the possibility of utilizing Russians of anti-Soviet and anti-German views to thwart German plans in the Soviet Union in the event of German occupation it was decided to ask Bruce Lockhart to make ennuiries of the Czechs and let us know their views.   This he has now done and imports that Benes is opposed to any such scheme. Bruce Lockhart himself agrees with this view and adds cogent reasons of his own. I enclose a copy of his minute.   In these circumstances we propose to drop the idea.   A similar letter is being sent to Woolcombe VAi'i Offree   H.M.G. Jebb Esq., 12th July 1941.   BRITISH EMBASSY   MOSCOW.   My dear Wiskeman   My letter to Col. Taylor gives official news but I want to get a line off to you by this bag.   Firstly thank you so much for all your help whilst I was in London and particularly on the last hectic day. The journey went well. I was flying it seemed continously from 3Â°' clock that afternoon until 9 the following evening. And then again from 5 to 9 the following morning when we arrived at Moscow Airport. The flight by Catalina was uneventful but interesting all the same. The Machine was extraordinarily steady. We took turn about on watch  in rear blister and were struck by the efficiency of the crew. Very tough job this for the pilot we thought.   The usual old style Russian party at A. It went on until about 2 in the morning for those not knowing Russia1. . The heat here is really tropical. Quite usual for July and August though. Anyone coming here during these months should have some tropical kit. I had forgotten about this after all these years. Nothing can be bought out here.   I am busy enough. I am glad to have fallen straight into a field of activity pending other things.   Party from the Middle East arrived the other day including Befcthoud. I had a good talk with him yesterday.   In the rush of our last day I forgot one or more important articles of kit which will have been packed with the things we left at the Hotel. I would be most grateful if you could get hold of them and send them to me by any opportunity there may be a chance or perhaps more than one cahnce during the near future but preferably as soon as possible. The things I want are -Tartan breeches. A battle suit there is one with a new pair of trousers. Gaiters for the latter. Winter vests. And if you can manage it a soft rough felt hat civilian size 7k All except the latter will be found amongst the kit I left at the Hotel. Many thanks and very sorry to trouble you.   I had the opportunity of nailing definitely one lie on the German Wireless this morning. They stated that the Russian Govt together with ourselves had left Moscow and that they had gone to Nijni Novgorod., All the best to you and I hope that you are in good form and oin strong. Please remember me to Kennedy.   Yours very sincerely   L.R. Hulls P.S. Have you any letters that could be sent at same time., QW   ath Jjily 1941.   2 b JUL t\   COPY scfa.  BRITISH EMBASSY    UkfLsiz V /    . c. MOSCOW.    '7-U   f v..   C   Dear Taylor y   h   I do not think that our first telegram of the 7th July will have caused you surprise. The points to remember as far as I am concerned are contained in the wording of your original telegram No.SO of July 4th . I mean where you wrote 1. to proceed as soon as possible to the Caucasus and 2. in the event but only in the event of central control showing signs of weakening.   We all know that the activities planned are designed for the time when a breakdown might result in NOTHING being done by the authorities on the spot whoever they might be with the result that the Germans would get away with everything unhindered.   Whilst then there is little chance of my getting to the Caucasus right awaj'- I am keeping the above clearly in mind and nobody appreciates better than the General the ultimate object in view namely to put a spoke in the wheel of the Germans. Consequently when the opportunity occurs I have no doubt that everything possible will be done to get me to the scene of action.   I was surprised on arrival here to find that suspicion of foreigners -despite Russian entry into War -has not abated and that it is out of the question at present for a foreigner to move anywhere unobserved. One wuld think that as far as the British are concerned they would have sense enough of the fitness of things to cancel this unpleasant habit. But this suspicion is ingrained to such an extent that they are blind to the fact that it sonstitutes a definite hindrance to their own much greater interest namely defeating the Enemy.   No real information on any branch of activity let alone about the battles now in progress is ever forthcoming. The old axiom in every plan project operation of first setting out and considering INFORMATION just cannot fee followed you may imagine the difficulty with which the head of such a Mission is faced. Only a definite order from the very top will remove this state of affairs. Perhaps it may come though I doubt it.   It is interesting though rather distressing to note the changes wrought by this regime. Not all is bad of course but there is a general grimness. People are terribly badly clad -ALL of them with the exception of senior Army officers and their equivalent in the civil administration. There is no free contact between the people and any foreigner. The hazard for th6 former is too great.   Moscow in 20 years has grown by 2 millions -more than doubled, and I must say that steps on a grand scale are afoot to solve the   housing problems. A huge building programme is in progress and I   have seen all round Moscow great numbers of enormous blocks nearing   completion all at a full stop just now of course .   But if the former lowest level in standard of living has been raised -I have only seen Moscow though -the middle and higher categories have all been reduced to the present low standard and consequently the outward aspect is unifxipm drabness and grimness. I am unfortunately quite ignorant so far as to the real life at home at home of these people. I hope to get a true picture some time.   Meantime the struggle at the front is still on. I feel it is not going QUITE according to the German programme. The latter seem to have flung almost the whole of their armoured Divisions into the battle here and I expected more decisive results by the 4th week.   I have taken part in numerous meetings this week. Interpreting at the talks with the General and General Pa.nfilof and taking care of the meeting between our Fire and ARP experts and their Russian opposite numbers.   We are housed in the old Yugo Slav Embassy. Food is too luxurious. Climate just now is tropical and I am not fitted out for it. Pity about the last minute rush. I am very fit though.   All the best. Please remember me to Sir Frank. I hope that you are all well and going strong.   Yours sincerely   Leslie R. Hulls, sc/vf.   augm   AD/lR/755 7.8.41.   TO C.E.O. PROM A/D.

Both Dew's and Crosthwaite's comments are rather muddled and they see confusion where none exists. Actually the position of S.0.2. in Persia and its relationship to the various Government bodies which have an interest in its activities are perfectly clear. S.0.2. exists in Persia to provide machinery for sub versive activities. It can get its directives for the use of this machinery from various sources namely its own Head Office in London the C. In C. Middle East the newly-established Near Eastern Bureau CAUB the C. in C. India the Government of India and of course H.M.R. Teheran. Perfectly clear and adequate lines of communication exist between S.0.2. Persia and these bodies which enable S.0.2. Persia to get directives to be kept advised of what these other bodies may themselves be doing and to keep these bodies advised of what it is doing. 3. The London Office communicates direct with Teheran and thus provide the means by which any requirements of any Government Departments in London can be met. The C. in C. Middle East can communicate through S.0.2. Cairo. The same applies to CAUB. The C. In C. India is represented by the G.O.C. Baghdad and communication between the latter and the S.0.2. representative in Teheran has been laid on through the M.A's at Baghdad and Teheran. As regards the Government of India once the Mackenzie Mission gets to work in India it will provide a channel of communication similar to that between Teheran and Cairo. In the meantime we are arranging that the interests of the Government of India should be looked after by the D. I.B. with whose representative Any complexity which may possibly e3d.st in the demarcation of the spheres of the C. in C. Middle East and the C. in C. India does not affect us at all. 4. I am frankly rather at a loss to see why Crosthwaite or anybody else in the Foreign Office should worry about our relationship with any of the bodies referred to above. Their own interests are fully protected by the Foreign Office's contact with this office and H.M.R's with our representative in Teheran. 5. In his comments Crosthwaite remarks that he has not yet been able to answer Bullard's telegram from Teheran of the 13th July at E.3852/G. This is I trust an error since this telegram has in reality been answered by the Foreign Office telegram to Bullard advising him that the Russian Embassy has been instructed by the Soviet Govern ment to co-operate with S.0.2. on subversive work in Persia. Bullard's telegram needs no other reply than this. oOo, -------   WITH MR. CAVENDISH-BENTINCK'S COMPLIMENTS.   Sir Ortae Sargent.   I append a paraphrased translation of a report just received from Colonel Pika the head of the Czechoslovak Military Mission in Russia    The situation on the front for the week ending November 24 was as follows   1. The German offensive against Moscow is being conducted with strong forces from five directions Tula Malojaroslavec Mojalsk Volokolansk Klin. The Russians are defending themselves tenaciously. They have found the best means of resisting being surrounded by tanks. The infantry keep on fighting and from a close distance spray the tanks with liquid fire. In several places the Germans have succeeded in advancing a few kilometres but so far they have not reached the direct defences of Moscow. The strongest attack is in the North-West where the Ger mans have succeeded in making deep penetrations at Volokolansk and at Klin. In this sector and also at Tula the situation is serious. 2. It can be expected that the Germans will continue their strong attacks against Moscow but I am firmly persuaded that as soon as they come up against the direct defences of Moscow their offensive will be definitely broken because the defence is well or ganised. At that moment the Russians might be able to adopt a much stronger line of action and to drive back the Germans further from Moscow. They still have unused reserves. 3. Fighting in the Leningrad area is on a small scale and the local successes of the Germans have had no influence on the defence of the city. The situation in the sector between Orel and Stalino is not clear. The Germans however are gradually gaining ground.   In South Russia the fighting at Rostoff has had no very serious influence and the Russians continue to hold out. The Russian successes to the west of Rostoff have not yet been exploited. Government circles here have received a message that the impor tance of these local successes will be revealed in a few days.   4. Government and military circles have received messages from the front and from General Zukoff him self. They are to the effect that the offensive will certainly be stopped. On the whole however the situation in the Moscow sector is serious and it would be a mistake to conceal this. But ac cording to our reliable information the Russians have not yet used all the methods of defence or their reserves who can be used with success at the moment when the Germans are confronted by the direct defence line of Moscow. 5. In the Cis-Volgar sector are concentrated very large units which however are not fully armed either with tanks or with artillery and this equip ment must be completed by material from England and America part of which is already on Soviet soil. These units/,  'hese units must soon be established as a   - rategic reserve. They are however not   to be used to supplement front-line units but will be kept as a whole for a greater   action.   There are considerable transport diffi culties. The capacity of the railways is small and the movement of troops takes a long time especially as far as the transfer of Siberian divisions is concerned. The journey from Siberia to the front lasts a month or more.   6. The course of the fighting during the early part of the winter can be contemplated with confidence. By the middle of winter the situation should improve. Here people expect that if the fighting continues as it has been up to now it is not excluded that by January there will be a definite breaking-up of the offensive against Moscow.  Signed R.H.

L  In the course of ray talk with Sir Orme Sargent  on Russia last Thursday the following points arose   l Qur Li lsQ n...-iith ..ths-lasaians Sir Orme Sargent asked how this was going gen erally and I replied that the attitude of the Russians  in regard to the Yugoslav partisans had rather cast a gloom  over the proceedings moreover the Russians had not been  particularly helpful with regard to the proposal to inter  change representatives in Eastern Asia. I attributed  these developments to some order having been given to the  O.G.P.U probably by M. Yolotoff to the effect that they should not be too friendly and should make difficulties  if possible. If this were done it was probably because  M. Kolotoff wanted to make difficulties generally for reasons of his own and I asked whether the Foreign Office  had experienced any similar unco operativeness on the part  of the Russians since the return or the Foreign secretary. Sir Orme Sargent replied that there had been no  particular signs of this on their front. He asked as  from what date we had noticed such tendencies in our own  dealings with the Russians I replied as from about the  end of the year. He then said he supposed this was not  connected in any way with the removal of Guinness and the  taking over of his functions by Hill. I said I did not  think this was so since Guinness had told the Minister he  was entirely convinced that Hill was the right man for the  job. nevertheless I think that Sir Orrae would like to  be reassured on this point by Guinness himself. I then said that we had at the instance of the  Foreign Office gone slow with the suggestion that the  Russians should go to Jerusalem this was in the nature  of a'reprisal' against the action of the Russians in regard  to Yugoslavia. Mr. warner here expressed surprise that  we had accepted this suggestion of the Foreign Office  since from our point of view he would have thought it  would have been wiser to have allowed the arrangement to  proceed. I said that if this was the Foreign Office  view we would certainly reconsider our attitude since I  myself doubted whether the Russians would really behave  better in regard to the partisans if we refused to allow  their man to come to Jerusalem. I think indeed that I  might now well write to Sir Orme saying that we would like  to reconsider the suggestion and ask the Foreign Office s  consent to our proceeding with the negotiations.,  2 Facilities given to Russian Agents. This has already been dealt with in ray letters to Sir Orme Sargent and to Loxley copies of which went to you.    5 Russian Mbitions. I referred to the report which you had mentioned to me that the Russians did not object   to the Yugoslav/Greek pact but would object to any scheme for Balkan unity for the reason that they  the Russians wished to incorporate more or less in their sphere Hungary Bulgaria and Roumania tofether with some window on to the Aegean Sea.   ir Orme expressed great interest in this report the authorship of which I said that I had forgotten I now seem to remember however that it originated with Gavrilovic.   Unless you see any objection I should like to pass this on as soon as possible to Sir Orme.    Sgd - C.E.O.   24th January 1942., k uu '   r   F/S227/85   This is to give you the glad news of the return of GuIilHlSS who has just arrived back from Moscow. e shall of course shortly examine him on how HILL is doing and on the lat ter s relations with the Russians and I think that in a few days time he might go round and have a word with you yourself.   I have now discovered that Gavrilovic was the author of the report which I mentioned at our last meeting to the effect that the Russians would not object to a Yugoslav/Greek pact but would object to any scheme for Balkan unity for the reason that they the Russians wished to incorporate more or less in their sphere Hungary Bulgaria and Roumania together with some window on to the ife-gean Dea. If you think there is anything in this report I should think it would be best for some mehber of the Foreign Office to cross-examine Gavrilovic. Personally I should think it was quite possibly nothing more than an intelligent speculation.    Sgd - GLADWYH JEBB.   Sir Orme Sargent K.C.M.G. C.B.   Foreign Office., S'vJJ   G. J. Sir 0.

A.. The letter wasHwrit ten on the instructions of Morawski who  fcin charge of the Ministry in aczyn P s absence.    Some days ago the Soviet war news published a manifesto of s ome 30 repre sentatives of Baltic intelligentsia who protest against the German occupation and expect the return of the Soviet rule to their countries. Of course nothing is easier than to make people in concentra tion camps sign manifestoes of any charac ter. The difficulty consists in being able to prove it. I have asked my indus trious colleague who is dealing with Li thuanian affairs to verify some of the 14 Lithuanian signataries and the enclo sed paper is what he was able to pro duce. Two of the signataries are in Li thuania and two are dead. Have the other   Jjn signed the manifesto We do not know.   sure that Messrs.Torma and Zarins may throw some light on the supposed sig natures of their countrymen andperhaps tsok make similar discoveries. I understand   that, that there is a cell in the Ministry of Economic Warfare which is interested in de   tailed analysis of the situation in Lithu ania. Lihrach who is in touch with them   is away and I do not myself know anyone   there. May I ask you to do me the favour   of transmitting the attached copies   them .

From M   AD   7ith re erence to the enclosed papers the position up to the present has been that the official in the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has passed certain information through M Librach to MPO for unofficial transmission to the F.0 He has passed such information to Mr. Brook who in turn has passed it on to the F 0   Generally speaking MPO is interested in Baltic States matters as he collaborates with S Section on these . What has happened in this case is that as Librach was absent the Polish official in question used Savery as a channel for getting information into FPO's hands. The official of course does not know anything about us and thinks that Librach works with the M.E.W   As MPO has known Savery for many years he was his chief in Poland he has had a word v/ith him on this subject and explained discreetly the position. Savery therefore is prepared for a non-committal reply from O.E.O. or even no reply at all in other words the matter is closed as far as he is concerned, I C. i ut 0 A\ 'j r o / Vi  i-.Hu, , 'V' 'Ay      According to tne Soviet War News Nr. 167 of January 24th IS42 14 Lithuanians of Litnuanisn nationality have signed a Soviet declaration.

His section 3 especially the last three paragraphs of it give in my opinion a very accurate picture of the situation in Russia to-day.   ENCLS, LAST IMPRESSIONS OF RUSSIA.   I left Kuibyshev unexpectedly on the   9.4.42. without unfortunately having been able to see HILL before my departure. My exit visa was valid only until the 12.4.42. so that there was not enough time to go to Moscow first. We were held up at Baku for two nights by weather. Baku is definitely the most attractive Soviet town I have seen during this visit and the inhabitants were far less glum and depressed looking than elsewhere. The town itself is clean and the houses do not have that decrepit appearance characteristic of the other towns. Bread queues are both long and nuaerous but the people waiting in the queues seemed reasonably happy this may perhaps be ascribed to the warmer weather. We drove through the oil-fields a number of times. The number of derricks is enormous and many of them were working.   2. LAST INTERVIEW WITH KOT. KOT has been ill the past few weeks and 1 think he would be glad to leave Russia. He considers that he has built up the framework of Polish organisa tion in Russia and that the work can now be continued by some less eminent person. His successor-designate is ROMER former Polish Minister to Tokyo who is unfortunately interned at Shanghai.   I consider that KOT has done a really very good job of work and that he has gained the whole hearted support of all classes of Poles in Russia including the Army. He was always accessible to any Pole however dirty and ragged and made absolutely no distinctions of party allegiance past history creed or nationality. His attitude to all was consistently that he was there to protect arid assist Polish citizens and Polish interests in so far as was compatible with the terms of the Russo-Polish agreement. I have on many occasions heard him tell groups of Polish deportees and most recently a group of Polish officers from Scotland that whether they like it or not Russia is Germany s most formidable immediate enemy and that Russia's fight is thus also Poland's fight. He warned the officers not to encourage or entertain anti-Stalinist feelings for if the Government were to be more to the left chaos would result whilst a more Rightist Government could only be pro-German.   3. STATEMENT BT A POLISH EX-COMMUHIST. KOT had an interview with a Pole who had been imprisoned in Poland for communistic activities and had after being released escaped to the U.S.S.R. where he was for some years a member of the Soviet of the V/hite Russian   3.S.R. He was finally arrested probably because it was realised that he was beginning to be disillusioned as to the real nature of the Soviet Government. After five years in a camphe was released thoroughly cured of communism. His remarks on the development of Russian Government policy are illuminating. Up till /, Up till 1929 Stalinism meant socialism in our time in our own country . Communism was encouraged in other countries which could if the movement were successful 'become independent Soviet republics. The leaders of communist activities were mfcives of the countries concerned and they enjoyed'considerable liberty of action there being little attempt to subordinate them completely to Moscow.   With the close of the first Piatiletka in 1934 a radical change took place. Practically all the foreign leaders were superseded by nominees of Moscow and thereafter the communist movement in countries out side the Union was rigorously controlled by Moscow practi cally down to the smallest detail. By the close of the second Piatiletka the industrial strength of the Union was such that it was decided to launch a policy of imperialism differing from that of Gzarist Russia only in its greater efficiency the objectives were the same viz. Finland the Baltic States. all Slav countries Turkey and China. Annexations would in all cases be presented as spontaneous revolts of the oppressed workers who would then petition for admission into the Union. The Empress Catherine it may be remembered employed an identical policy in defence of the dissidents .   However Stalinism in its present imperial istic form is still not identical with Trotskyism the difference being that Trotsky postulated world-wide revo lution with the creation of independent Soviet republics whilst Stalirism has only the limited objectives mentioned above and would not tolerate the independence of the nations concerned.   To this I ascribe the impossibility of any real co-operation between Russia and the Allies. We are useful to the now as sources of supply but pot entially dangerous. Very few Russians would trust a fellow Russian but practically no Russian will trust an English man in particular or indeed any Western European in general. They feel that whatever we do or say there must be some very subtle catch to it and if none is evident it just proves our excessive cunning. So that for reasons both of general policy and national temperament a gulf is fixed between us. Transactions between us should be on a basis of strict'reciprocity if we are to retain their respect their love we cannot hope to have v/hatever sacrifices we make.   CZECH AFFAIRS.   I saw Colonel PIKA early in April immedia tely before his departure to the All-Slav Congress. As to this the Polish and Jugoslav M.As. had also been invited but declined the invitation with the full support of their respective governments. I enclose two papers with reports of the speeches including that of Col. PIKA'a.   Colonel PIKA said that the object of the Congress was to appeal to the enslaved Slavs to hinder Germany in her war against Russia. I asked why the Soviets   did not /, did not get down to brass tacks instead of talking and try to organise some sort of practical colla boration. Thus he had long complained that he had no contact whatsoever with the Russians so I asked why did not they not establish contact with him instead of arranging hot air -parties. To this he answered that he now had regular contact and that all was progressing satisfactorily. I expressed my joy at this news and asked for details. Finally it transpired that it had 'been mutually decided to.do nothing until the front was much closer to Czechoslovakia and this ZHUKOV said might he expected in June. I remarked that this left barely time to organise and train personnel for dropping in Czecho but PIKA said this was not so as the entire training could be completed in three weeks. Whereupon we parted exchanging sentiments of the highest cordiality and devotion.   Shortly after this I was informed by BOGIC former Jugoslav Charge d Affaires and now Chief Councillor of the Jugoslav Legation that the Czech Minister FIRLIHGER and most of his staff including PIKA are to all intents and purposes v/orking for the NKVD and specifically that every scrap of information received by them is immediately relaid to the NKVD. One of the secretaries working at the Czech Legation is actually an employe of the NKVD.   FIRLINGKR s communistic views are a matter of comraon knowledge in Kuibyshev diplomatic circles but this is by no means equivalent to suspecting him and parti cularly PIKA of being NKVD agents. I told BOGIC that I thought this was rather a serious allegation not to be made unless there is definite evidence. He said that he was informed of these things by VA SK a Czech journalist living with his family in the Czech Legation and that CoL. BEROUNSKY the Czech Air Attache had already left for England with a report to the same effect. Actually as I learned from a different source Col. BSROUHSKY's departure jyas due to the death of his v/ife so that he had to go to England to maize arrangements for the care of his children.   However I notified HILL of the desirability of exercising caution in his dealings with the Czechs pending confirmation or refutation of this statement and sent a telegram from Teheran informing you. I suggest that a talk with BEROUNSKY who is a very reliable person might go far towards clearing matters up. I must add from myself that I have never had any reason to believe that PIKA holds communist views -quite the contrary.   5. TEHERAN. The city is full of Poles to the tune of 30 000 soldiers 12 500 civilians and a number of Polish A.T.S. probably about 2 000. The men and the A.T.S. look very fit the civilians less so. All are delighted to be out of Russia but they are still very careful of what they say to people. I imagine they have been warned not to run down Russia as this would prejudice the release of further Poles.   Evacuation was conducted without a hitch with no deaths from starvation en route. There are still   a few /, a few cases of typhus hut this is not thought to he serious. Several hospitals have been opened and the entire European community is busy looking after the civilian refugees. In this the Americans have been part icularly helpful. Many of the troops have already reached their base depot in Palestine.   Soviet troops are little in evidence at Teheran. They are not numerous and are kept at the airport. Seemingly very few passes are issued as they are rarely seen in the streets.   The Persians are apparently quite pro- German and scarcely a wall is not decorated with a swastika. However hammers and sickles are also fre quent qs are also V signs. The fairly large Russian population of Teheran is anti-Persian find probably largely pro-Soviet in the lower classes but pro-German in the upper classes.   While in Teheran I met numerous Poles. One of these was a doctor GRABA-LECKI who had been a prominent member of the Colonel s party before the war . and was Vice-President of the city of Warsaw at the out-1 break of v/ar. He had since been kept in cold storage in Cyprus and Palestine but was called up a month ago for medical service for the Poles from Russia. Showing him before the war I noticed a perceptible change in outlook which had become far broader and more tolerant with a real appreciation of British methods. I think that not only has the Polish Government largely abandonned its old policy of persecution of members of the ancien regime but also that the latter have become more reasonable and appre ciative of the work of General SIKORSKI. With the arrival of the troops from Russia the scramble for employ ment of supernumary officers will also become less acute so that I think that a period of comparative harmony is to be expected in the Polish camp.   A second Pole whom I met was a Mr. LOPATT who had been Polish Consul at Kuibyshev and who had left there by train about two weeks before my departure. His journey lasted 27 days via Tashkent Krasnovodsk Baku and Pahlavi. Although he was armed with all sorts of sauf-conduits laissea-passer letters of recommendation to thevHKVD etc. he found it extremely difficult to get any sort of food anywhere en route. The local NKVD boys took not the least interest in his letters and were as unhelpful as possible. Security was bad in particular at Arissa Tashkent and Krasnovodsk where the stations were occupied by huge masses of travellers to nowhere for no particular reasons and bands of youths bezprizornie absolutely terrorised the towns. The militia did not dare to intervene against them although their favourite tricks consisted in snatching the luggage of   travellers as well as knifing and robbing people in side streets. LOPATTO saw a child killed by one of them withou any attempt being made by the authorities or citizens to arrest the murderer.   Much of this has doubtless since changed. On the 5/4/42 KAGAHOVITCH was sacked and railways were   militarised /, militarised. Prom that day the trains began to run on  time which never happened before. Only those who were travelling on duty were allowed to enter trains aid joy riding was stopped. As a consequence the bulk of the crov/ds camping out at all stations will now doubtless gradually fade away to the benefit of public safety and  sanitation and to the increased comfort of those who have to travel on duty. Also I should imagine that v/hole battalions of spies and fifth columnists who could pre viously stay in Russia with perfect security would thus be abolished.  Other persons of interest met in Teheran were the P.C.O. who was BLAKE-TYLER's protagonist in Buda and who struck me as being a very sensible person and of Kovno who hasnow been assigned for some special duty in connection with Poles in Persia.  I am steadily working through the points enumerated in your letter end have most but not all of them fairly clear in my mind now. The situation is definitely very complicated and the inconceivable internecine quarrels of the local Jugoslavs and Greeks render any collaboration with them both difficult and perilous. I shall send a preliminary report on ray Cairo activities with the next fast mail.  The equivalent of 12 000 from Moscow is being sent by the local Finance Officer to London by this bag.  My best regards to all at the office I am longing to see you again.   Cairo   XoFT BUCHKOHOS  21.4.42., 22m   MOST SECRET   CIPHER TELEGRAM  050653.   From 30 Military Mission Desp. 2300 19 Tun.42.

On July 9th I drove with Yagodin to Village in Mozhaisk district where I was introduced to Batya who answered questions freely and with utmost candour criticised Kremlin and array handling of partisans problems and made many constructive suggestions. 2. Greatest criticism was lack of wireless for broadcasting. There is no current even in the town and battery sets are very limited. Lack of information papers or leaflets. For instance in his district of thousand square kilometres no one had heard of Anglo-Soviet pact. Difficult gauge accuracy of German propaganda lack of medical stores though have own hospital and badly wounded smuggled to Soviet lines. General shortage of food though partisans not short of meat and milk. Batya stopped home distilling owing to lack of grain. Great shortage of fresh greens. 3. Batya commenced to operate at the end of August with a dozen friends. He now directs 3 500 and could command thousands more if arms and ammunition were available. Only those bringing their own arms are recruited. There is a waiting list of men and women who have rendered valuable scout or other services. Captured arms and ammunition distributed to such. Age of partisans male and female 10 to 80. Some of the best scouts are girls of 10-12 years. After lunch with Batya Essopov Yagodin and Pozharski I talked freely to 16 men and 9 women partisans youngest girl 14 oldest man 70. All were in civilian clothes but armed. Batya was in nondescript uniform but only because of visit to Moscow. 4. Batya states that whole districts are under Partisans control. The Germans only venture on occasional punitive expeditions which were previously composed of first class troops but are now of weak troops badly led. Germans when cornered fight to end other nationalities surrender though expecting to be shot. In his own, 2   district Batya drives in small car using stolen German petrol. Partisans go freely into German-occupied towns as villagers to make purchases and spy.   5. Partisans' activities concentrated against a enemy-occupied villages where crops burnt and surrounding illuminated by night  b railways and c arterial roads. 6. Batya thinks his people destroyed over 10 000 Axis troops but only claim h 800 whose bodies found. Casualties -other than t ose executed in villages by punitive expeditions which are heavy -100 including few killed through inexperience in handling bombs. Partisans are now taking prisoners as Army requires them for examination. 7. Government give every encouragement to Partisans. Batya has had highest decoration from Stalin and is housed in best hotel when in Moscow. Followers are also decorated but for security reasons secretly will receive all rights and monetary awards subsequently. 8.

The Commissioner assured me that these tools were urgently required for new factories in Russia and that efforts to arrange for them to be transported direct to Moscow had been unsuccessful. I was given to understand that the Soviet Government were most disappointed that we had only been able to transport less than 100 kilogrammes of this material since October and they had expected a more serious effort on our part. The Commissioner added that he had been instructed to press us to deliver in London 4 tons this month and a similar amount next month.  2. I do not[ grp.omitted know] how much importance you attach to the matter on operational and political grounds. If however the matter is considered to be of major importance I would suggest that arrangements should be made to send a Mosquito aircraft specially to ferry across this material. I understand that such aircraft could carry about one ton of freight per trip if the material is packed in small parcels.

The meeting took place in quite a friendly spirit and I endeavoured from the outset to impress Chichaeff with the fact that we are most anxious to help the Russians in every way possible.   Chichaeff started his attack with a long recital of complaints about the alleged mismanagement of PICEAXE operations during the past eighteen months laying emphasis on the lack of facilities afforded by us.   He commented on documents for his agents which had been badly prepared by us on breaches of security in the housing and despatching of his agents and the inefficient work at Station 61 in an alleged mixing up on one occasion of containers for agents destined for Holland and Belgium respectively. He also complained about the fact that his agents had been treated like criminals when sitting for their photographs under our security arrangements together with a mass of minor and frequently irrelevant criticisms of our methods. He also mentioned the indifferent arrangements made for the reception at our ports in Scotland of agents arriving from Russia.   I   He also mentioned delay in providing sea passage in the Mediterranean for the ETNA party to be landed by felucca or submarine on the French or Italian Riviera coast.   His most severe attack though was his allegation that we have obstructed the dropping of his agents in Holland Germany and Austria by withholding air transport facilities. In the last seventeen months he had produced twenty-three bodies from Russia.of whom only seven had been dropped by us on the Continent -chree had been killed five had been returned to Russia for lack of transport facilities and eight were still av/aiting air transport.   He finished up with the accusation that we were not fulfilling our part of the bargain as laid down in the joint charter which had been signed by him with S.G.E. in that instead of co-operating with Russia we were actively following an anti-Russian policy in support of which accusation he mentioned that we were supporting in Yugoslavia Mihajlovic who was not fighting the Germans at all but was concentrating his efforts on a civil war against the partisans. He also alleged that Major Masterson in Cairo had suggested that we should approach Maniu with the promise of Rumania retaining Bessarabia and Bukovina as a bribe to co-operate with us. Chichaeff asserted that this shows that we were following an anti-Russian policy and in the face-of all this nonco- operation on our part he had decided that the only thing for him to do was to recommend to his own Government that his Mission should be v/ithdrawn from London.   7. With the assistance of D/P I disposed of his long catalogue of minor reproaches some of which I was able to explain away and for others I accepted blame on our part but promised improvement in future. As regards the failure to afford air transport facilities I said that the whole of our organization was suffering equally from the same disability that we had not sufficient aircraft at our disposal for all the operations we had planned throughout occupied Europe./   m m, 2   8. 9. 10. 11. Europe. We really had only one Squadron of Halifaxes at our disposal for dropping op-erations and there were only about twelve nights in each month when these could be used owing to the moon period. Unfortunately during the last three months the weather during the moon period had been unprecedentedly bad. and a great many of our operations had consequently not been carried out. This affected our own agents just as much as it did the PICKAXE ones and we were representing'to the Chiefs of Staff how important it was to increase our allotment of aircraft for S.O.E. operations. Eaturally he must realize that we were trying to win the war by the most effective means. We fully realized the magnificent efforts which the Russian Army was making on the Eastern Front and watched their progress with admiration. It was the opinion of our Chiefs of Staff that they could best assist the Russian effort by a defeating the U-Boat menace and b breaking up the industrial potential and powers of resistance of the German people. These two. objectives which ranked first in order of priority involved heavy and continuous bombing both of the Atlantic bases and of German industrial targets. S.O.E. operations were considered to rank after these primary tasks but I was representing to the Chiefs of Staff how greatly our operati could be facilitated by a very small additional allotment of bomber aircraft and crews. Should we obtain additional aircraft I had every hope that we would be able to carry out successful dropping operations with his parachutists in the near future and they would be afforded a very high degree of priority among our projected operations.   As regards the ETNA.party which was going to the Mediterranean the Royal Navy are now ready to accept this party if they will travel by felucca as this is considered a more practicable method than by submarine.   As regards his allegations about our political manoeuvres In the Balkans I told him that we were not committed to any particular political party in Yugoslavia but we were prepared to back any group under arms which was prepared .to fight against our enemies the Germans and the Italians. As we knew that Mihajlovic was in a position to do this and was fact doing it we had supplied him with weapons and explosi- and whenever vie were in a position to obtain longer range aircraft which could reach the partisans further north we would be equally willing to supply them with arms and explosives. It was a matter of great regret to us that in countries like Yugoslavia there were different factions that seemed more anxious at times to fight eachbther than to fight the comraon enemy. We did not propose to back any one faction against another but merely encourage all to fight against Germany and Italy and assist in winning the war.   I told Chichaeff that I greatly deprecated his proposal to withdraw his Mission from London as I considered that if he would only have a little patience we hoped to secure satisfactory results in our operations which had been hindered in the past not through any lack of goodwill on our part but purely through shortage of air transport facilities.   The atmosphere then cheered up somewhat aided by a glass of sherry all round. /q   s S-o.   t Os7  kk 4 1/, I   P/7314/85 13th. February 1943   To . S.O. Prom AD/S.   Here is D/CD 0 1s record of his meeting with Colonel Chichaeff the Russian in London who represents H.K.V.D. You will remember that I explained to you on Friday the circumstances which, ,    The result of all this has been that during the last fortnight the N.K.V.D. representative here and the liaison officer attached to us in Moscow have kicked up a tremendous row have threatened to break off all collaboration and to make a formal complaint of our behaviour through diplomatic channels.  While I have explained the reason for our inability to transport more of their agents by air more regularly 3 have hit back at them and have made complaints of our own both here and in Moscow but I have not discouraged them fron HI making diplomatic representations if they wish to do so. I am of the opinion that they will not do so.  The method I employed was to get D/S with all his prestige to interview the head man here and for your information I attach a copy of this interview.  I will let you know if anything more happens but I doubt whether I shall need to worry you., To l/ From AD/s.   F/7344/85 18th February 1943.   74    OK 4 e   I have not shown the attached papers 4 to S.O. because you sent me some days previously a copy of D/CD 0 's record of his meeting with Colonel Chichaeff which S.O. has already read. Although I would like him to see your minute CD/4520 I do not think I can very well put the accompanying document up to him a second time.   As a result of his reading the record he writes the following note    lI am very glad to have seen this.   I would like a more detailed   report on the allegations mentioned   in the passage I have marked the   first sentence of paragraph three   and I would then like to see D/CD 0   or D/P .   I shall be very grateful if you will let me have the information S.O. asks for although it is of course a very old story indeed.      Q   HSt.   ijkJi'   TSJfP ZLch, 11th March 1942.   COPY   b %fdi    S Colonel Tchltchaeff   We have examined the alterations on the enclosed Wehrpass and are surprised how invisible they are. We would recommend any agent to use this Wehr pass. The question of inserting a new page is also impossible as the Wehrpass enclosed is a forgery and there is a visible difference between the two papers. I suggest that if any alterations are to be made a page is obtained from one of these forged Wehrpfisse., COPY MINUTE SHEET   c c To D/T.   Reference your 253 of 9.3.42.   We have examined the alterations very closely through a powerful glass and we are surprised how invisible they are. We think that this agent is being particularly fussy on this point although we realise the importance of taking no chances. Personally I would recommend any agent of ours to use it. I frankly think that if the examination of this man's Wehrpass becomes so close as is envisaged even if it passes scrutiny they will catch him out in some other flaw in his make-up.   It is .quite impossible to make it any better and I regret that the only other Wehrp&sse in our possession have pages ol a slightly different colour to the present one which would be considerably more noticeable than the alterations of date.   1 i   We presume that this particular Wehrpass is a forgery which would account for the slight difference in colour with the   original. '   We suggest the only way out of this difficulty is for the Russians to send completely new documents this would be much better than taking any unjustifiable risk.   IV.W. 9.3.42.

The alterations have been done as satisfactorily as possible. Though a suspicious eye on close examination of the alterations under the glass might notice something I think they are good enough to pass an ordinary examination. I personally would be prepared to take a chance on it.   With particular reference to HOPSTADTER's Maschinenfabrik letter the date has been changed to 8.2.42. and not 9 .2.42 as the alteration was less likely to be noticeable. Many German firms do business on Sundays and we do not think that the fact that a letter was dated on s Sunday would arouse comment.   IV. W. 24.2.42.

ALTERATIONS IN PAPERS'FOR WHISKEY -2 MEN FOR GERMANY   On 14th February the two men in this party handed me   the following documents and asked for certain dates to be   altered by our experts   Two Wehrpslsse   Five commercial letters. and Dienstausweise . On being shown ilshat was required I told them that I thought   the letters could probably be dealt with satisfactorily but   that the German Wehrpass was a most complicated document which   was deliberately designed to defeat the forger and that the   necessary alterations would therefore present some difficulty.   However I promisee to do the best I could and on 16th February   took all the papers to D/T as C' are probably more accustomed   to such things than our own organisation.    On 17th February D/T telephoned to say that 'C thought they could alter the WehrpMsse satisfactorily but that they weredoubtful about' the letters. In vievi/ of this D/T asked whether they should proceed with the alterations. I asked him to do the best he could as the letters were useless in their present state and said that if 'C' unavoidable ruined them we should have to bestir ourselves to produce new letters alto gether . On 25th February I received all the documents back and they were examined by D/P.l and DPR.l and myself and judged satis factory for a normal control although they would not .pass a really close inspection. However when they were returned to their ov/ners they esiused complete consternation. The letters were considered just.good enough although badly done as it was possible to see some thinness in the paper one Wehrpass was all right and the other one they refused to accept.   I   explained all the circumstances to them and also to DPR.l who had now also taken up the cudgels on their behalf and who, said among other things that such w/ork would not be tolerated in the N.K.V.D. organisation. Mr. Graur later told D/P.l that if he had informed him a month ago that.the British Secret Service did such dirty work he would not have believed it. They then asked whether I could have the pages replaced by new   f   ones. Time was by then extremely short as the party was due to leave on 28th February but I said I would do my best. I then asked D/T once more if he could help but was told -as I expected -that it was impossible in the time. However he undertook to telephone 'C' to find out whether they could improve on the job. This was also in vain and 'O' remarked that the alterations had been made considerably better than they had ever anticipated.   I have reported this episode rather fully because I feelreasonably confident that it will be unfavourably commented upon to SAM by the N.K.V.D. For our part we are quite satisfied that we went to the most competent people to have the job done and that they carried it out to the best of their ability..   Note In the circurhstances DPR.l has agreed that the party should leave in spite of these difficulties. If however their departure should be delayed until the next moon we shall probably be asked to try and improve on our previous efforts., 18 FEB Entd   dp/ru/1401. g' FEB i3 19th February 1943.

D. AGENTS This complaint was the subject of considerable negotia tion between 3.O.E. and 'C' and I attach copies of all the relevant memoranda which passed at the time. I feel these are self-explanatory. This operation was finally carried out on 25th March 1942 and as the aircraft did not return to base we are unable to state whether the agents were dropped   or not.    2 BREACH OF SECURITY III THE HOUSING-OF II.K.V.D. AGENTS On 23rd February 1942 a protest was made by the N.K.V.D. that one of the Pickaxe parties had been housed in an ordinary hotel where they came in contact with other people who might easily have compromised them. N.K.V.D. took a serious view   and asked for an explanation. On 26th February we explained to them that the party had   x been housed owing to lack of other accommodation in a special hotel approved by our security authorities that every measure had been taken to preserve their security and that the only other occupants seen by them were two of our own agents and some security policemen and then only at the mid-day meal as the Pickaxe party had a private sitting-room. We did not at the time attach a great amount of importance' tp this complaint but it obviously rankled.    3 INEFFICIENT WORK AT STATION 61 IN AN ALLEGED MIXING UP OF CONTAINERS On 21st and 24th June 1942 BARSAC and BURGUNDY operations and were successfully carried out in Hoiland/Belgium. On 23rd July DPR.l informed us that he had received a communication from BARSAC from which it appeared that the two agents had been delivered with the wrong equipment and in fact that the equip   ment .../, -2   ment of these two operations had been interchanged. This matter was at once reported to D/CE and M and the latter ordered a Court of Enquiry to be held. The finding of the Court of Enquiry was that although no definite proof could be establishdd of such a mistake it had however been shown that the possibility of a change of labels existed and that we were not in a position definitely to refute DPR.l's allegation. Later information provided by DPR.l has proved conclusively that such a mistake did in fact occur and we were placed in the position of having to transmit our regrets to the N.K.V.D. but without being able to explain where such a mistake could have arisen.   It appears from our investigation that the labels on the containers must have become detached and been substituted either between the packing office and the aerodrome or at the aerodrome itself. We immediately promised that we would rectify this unfortunate mistake by replacing the missing articles in a special operation and this was subsequently done when we delivered another wireless set and a sum of money to their agents in Holland.   As a result of this incident the whole procedure in respect of despatch of containers was overhauled and there now exists no possibility of such a substitution occuring in the future., i 8 MAR 194.3  Rofi CD/4698 15.3.4 .

Ua., Note Ttiis memorandum was begun in London on 28th March   part dictated between interviews on 30th and 31st March and part written in Scotland on 1st and 2nd April.   I have not had time to polish it nor will I be able to read the typescript. It is therefore very much a memo randum that has been dictated but not read.'1   Memorandum on BRITAIN RUSSIA SUBOPS AND AMERICA   A direct air service between U.K. and U.S.S.R. was inau gurated in November 1942 seventeen months after the Axis attacked Russia and has been run with fair regularity since then. It is most regrettable that its regularity is to be anyway temporarily -suspended. With the season's lengthening   hours of daylight a route other than the one now used must be found. It is difficult to understand why the Air Ministry and the B.O.A.C. who knew this would be necessary and who have full knowledge from past experience not only of Russian dila   'tory methods but also of the complexity of the problems involved should have waited until now -the eve of the last possible trip on the present route until the autumn -to get down to the job. It is estimated that the negotiations will take a month six weeks or more. During this time there will of course be no direct service. The failure on the part of the British authorities in the matter may have its explanation in the fact that they do not realise the importance of a regu lar quick .direct air service to British-Soviet relationship the benefits it has already brought and the enormous possibi lities of future benefits. Direct contact between British or Soviet representatives and their respective countries -and the possibility of leaving London for Moscow or vice versa and of being back in one's own office in the space of a week or ten days -should alone be sufficient reason for maintaining such a service now and in the critical months that lie ahead. On my previous visit I left Moscow on 16th July 1942      arriving, -2   arriving in London on 29th July -a journey of thirteen days. Returning to Moscow I left London on 18th August arriving 3rd September -sixteen days. On this visit however I dined in Moscow on Sunday 7th March and vas in my London office at 10 a.m. on Tuesday 9th March. One therefore arrived with fresh clear impressions of Moscow and the U.S.S.R conditions in one s mind and was in a position to pass these on in a fashion impossible by telegram or despatch.   The matter concerning U.S.S.R. set out in this memorandum is based on personal observation and study up to 7th March 1943. I consider it to be an accurate picture up to as late as 22nd March for I have had the advantage of meeting two well-informed members of No.30 Military Mission and a member of the Embassy staff who left Moscow on that date by direct plane. Prom them despite the fall.of Kharkov I learnt of no major alteration which affects in any way my general appreciation of the situation.   During my three weeks' stay I have seen C.D. the Minister and members of S.O.E.j I have visited Stations IX XII and XV. Returning from seven months in the field certainly gives one some conception of hov/ the organisation is growing. I have also visited the Foreign Office War Office Admiralty and Air Ministry  all I S.I.S. and also members of I.P.I. the British Military Liaison Mission with U.S.S.R. Mission in London the Soviet Embassy DPR.2 the acknowledged heads of White Russians in emigration M.O.I. P.W.E. M.I.5. Sir Stafford Cripps former Ambassador to U.S.S.R. Sir Henry Tizard who heads a new scientific Mission to U.S.S.R. Sir Edward Mellsnby who is sending a new medical mission on behalf of the British Medical Research Council Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart Norwegian Belgian French Polish and Czechoslovak nationals the Editor of the Times Daily Telegraph Daily Herald Daily Express members of Mrs. Churchill's Aid to Russia Fund Committee M.E.W. Russian Committee members of U.S.A. Embassy staff the heads of O.S.S.   Mission the Swedish Legation. These added to my general observations of ordinary people in London have afforded me a good   cross-section .. /, -3   cross-section view of British public opinion and a passing   glimpse of the attitude towards Russia of allied and neutrals resident in London. I shall be able -I hope -in a matter of a few days to give the resultant impression to British and allied residents in Moscow as well as to my Russian colleagues.   The purpose of this memorandum is to give    1 My impressions of the conditions in U.S.S.R. up to 22nd March.  2 Suggestions as to the British policy that should be followedin cooperation with U.S.S.R. -    3 Suggestions as to the policy that should be pursued by S.Q.E. with the N.K.V.D. and the aims of the S.O.E. Mission in U.S.S.R. The most searching balanced and far-seeing matter that has appeared in print was published in the Times of 10th March 1943 in the special article Britain Russia and Europe1 and in the leading article of the day Security in Europe .   The opinions expressed in these two articles are not yet of course those of the British Government or of the Foreign Office . The two articles caused enough stir for a special board meeting of the Times at 1 a.m. on the morning of 10th March. In later editions of that issue the references to the Russian frontiers on the Oder were cut. The articles have also been strongly criticised by certain sections of the U.S.A. press. Nevertheless I would urge seniors in S.O.E. to re-read them in conjunction with this memorandum and in particular those responsible for the Country Sections of Poland Czechoslovakia   Yugoslavia Roumania France U.S.A. and finally but not least Germany for these articles do go to the root of a possible basis upon which the security of Europe in the future can be built up.   The memorandum is sub-divided into the following headings   I. CONDITIONS IN U.S.S.R.  A Military.  B Internal.  C Public Morale.  D U.S.S.R. 3 fear and caution in dealing with British Commonwealth ... /, -4-   Commonwealth of Nations and U.S.A. 11 S.R. 3 LIIiELY POST-V/AR INTENTIONS il1. U.S.S.R. IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH POLAND FINLAND CZECHO SLOVAKIA ROU ANIA YUGOSLAVIA AND BPLGAtllA IV t.S.S.R. AND GERFAI Y v AND JAPAN   VI. U.S.S.R. AND FRANCE I. CONDITIONS IN U.S.S.R.  A Military The lowest ebb in military fortune and morale since U.S.S.R. has been at war occurred in the period August-October 1942 when the Axis swarmed over the Don and Kuban took Maikop was ready to assail the Caucasus and settled Itself down to the taking of Stalingrad. The optimism that had prevailed in Russia following the holding by the Russians of Moscow the signing of the Eden-Molotov treaty of May last with its false hopes of a ' Second Front in 1942 -which arose from an allied diplomatic slip exploited shamelessly by the Soviet Government in putting the treaty over -evaporated when faced with the military blows sustained by the Russians in the early and late   autumn and the full realisation that there would be no Second Front in the Russian conception of such a front in 1942. The ebb even at its lowest produced no evidence that a minority section existed in the armed forces which considered the possi bility of throwing in its hand and seeking. or being ready to accept the possibility of a truce with Its foes. On the con trary while there undoubtedly was disappointment some despon dency and anxiety there were definite signs of determination to fight on best described in the accepted attitude If Stalingrad goes we will fight on and stand on the east bank of the Volga should the Caucasus go we will fight on the eastern shores of the Caspian if Moscow goes which it will not they said we will fight before Kuibishev and then with the Urals at our back. And the Soviet Army tired but reasonably cheerful   well-fed ... /, -5   well-fed equipped clothed despite a nasty period of searching enquiry impossible with us and ruthless weeding out settled down to its task.   Late in August 1942 I travelled by air from Cairo to Teheran with General Anders the Polish C.-in-C. in the hear East. He had just accompanied Mr Churchill on his visit to Moscow and had returned with him to Cairo. General Anders held that the Red Army could not then take the offensive and was unlikely ever again to be in a position to do so and that its role in the future at most would be a defensive one. He informed me that he had put these views on the previous evening most strongly to Mr. Churchill. He was wrong as Stalingrad has proved. I so strongly disagreed with his view -although I have known and admired General Anders for thirty years -that I urged YP Kuibishev by telegram from Teheran to send the Prime Minister the latest information in order to counteract the impression he may have gathered from the General. I also telegraphed D/HV to this effect with the same purpose.   Until late in November 1942 however it did not seem possible to me in Moscow that Stalingrad could and would be held.   It was during this period that the Polltruk/Politcommissars  Political Party B Commissars office was abolished throughout the Soviet armed forces by decree. The decree was promulgated in the press without warning. It was well and most prominently set out in all papers throughout the Union. In leading afticles the reason for the abolition of the service was fully explained and for the next ten days the matter was made a topical feature.      Thereafter it was not mentioned. Foreign opinion in Moscow and Kuibishev viewed the decree with excitement and it is fair to say that the majority considered it to be a score at long last for the Red Army against the sanguinary politicians and   .  in particular against the N.K.V.D. The Red Army was at last asserting itself and its attitude could best be described by the words of the song We won't we won't we won't --- In reality it was nothing of the kind. The facts are    V    1 /, -6    1 1116 need for Politruks had to a great extent vanished for the army had become motivated by a national patriotic sentiment which did not require the continuation of a special party B control.  2 From experience it had been learnt that the dual1 control of units by military and political commanders was impracticable.  3 While a good Politruk could get away with it a poor or weak one was taunted by the rank and file for remaining in the rear and styled an 'ambusque'. For these reasons the service was abolished. On good authority it may be taken that 80 of the Politruks took military   rank corresponding to their political one in units as combatant   officers the remainder were transferred to other work. The   army certainly did not feel it had gained a victory . For   those personally unacquainted with the Red Army the writer would   suggest that it should be viewed in the light in which we view   our own regular and citizen army. It has its perpetual grouse   as ours does but is not however politically conscious as a unit   and has no intention of being so.   The New Army   Towards the end of last October I telegraphed that epaulets   similar to those worn in the old Imperial forces of Russia wrere   to be reintroduced for officers and N.C.Os. of the services. While realising at the time that this was important it was impos   sible to foresee what an effect this would have on morale through out the forces and the degree of approval with which 90 of the population welcomed the return to gold lace and stars.   But before the introduction of epaulets dramatic events occurred which helped to raise the morale throughout the Soviet forces and give all classes of the population in U.S.S.R. a pride in their soldiers sailors and air-men.   The startling demand for the surrender of von Paulus and his army was featured in every newspaper and repeatedly broadcast over every wave-length. It will be remembered that von Paulus made no reply to this demand. There were signs of a little   uneasiness ... /, -7   uneasiness among the general population of Moscow who wondered whether the High Command had been over-confident . Then came the news of the relentless annihilation of the Axis forces and   the final surrender of von Paulus and his .generals.   In the meantime the military situation was eased on the Leningrad front. Successes were gained on the central fronts the Maikop oil-fields were recaptured and cleared for production.   It was at this time that the epaulets decree was.published. Throughout the forces within fifteen days after the publication of the decree the change-over was to be effected all over U.S.S.R. including the new insignia to be worn with battledress for forces in the field. With the decree special orders were published concerning the future deportment of officers and N.C.Os. their relationship and conduct in public of so reac tionary a nature as to seem unreal. Equality had gone. An officer caste was in being and an N.C.O. class with privileges social and military established. Morale went up discipline was tightened out of all recognition and saluting was most punctiiliouSly enforced. The forces like this and the general population approves. It is of interest to note that within the prescribed time with a few exceptions for which there was good reason the epaulets -were universally worn. The work of distribution must have been colossal this is'particularly stressed for it does show that there is central organisation and planning.   In February the 25th Anniversary of the Red Army was soberly celebrated without a word about its founder Leonid Trotsky. The nearest counterpart in this country to these celebrations were those of the R.A.F. on its completion of 25 years' service at the station at which this memorandum is being written the order is a normal working day.   Relationship between Officers and Men in the Red Army.   This is good. The new instruction referred to above concerning conduct would seem to widen the gulf hitherto exist ing between them but only to a degree for the services have   been .. /, -8   been circularised to the effect that officers and men can con   tinue to take meals together in public -and are encouraged to do so.   Relationship betYtreen Red Army and N.K.V.D.   in November 1942 the Army took over the Military Police work which until then had been carried out by the military section of N.K.V.D. There is in consequence much less dissatisfaction in the Army with the N.K.V.D. In fact if the N.K.V.D. have to apprehend a man they lose no time in handing him over to the Military Police.   The political training of all ranks which had been the responsibility of the Politruks mostly recruited from the ranks of N.K.V.D. is now given by the Unit Commander and delegated to others at his ovm discretion. In consequence the feeling that the N.K.V.D. was ' everywhere in the Army has now gone.   Military Admission into the Comraunist B Party   It is still difficult to get a party ticket. One may be a candidate for years without gaining admission. If a soldier who has been a dandidate is killed in action and has displayed exceptional courage or devotion to duty he may be admitted to the party posthumously. In very exceptional cases even non candidates have been so admitted. Posthumous admission is con sidered no small honour and it Is of real benefit to dependants.   Educational Reform   This is dealt with here as this reform will vitally affect   the future of the Soviet fighting services.   From next term co-education which has been universal in schools polytechnics and universities for the last twenty-five years is to be abolished as soon as the pupils reach the age of eight. Then the sexes are to be segregated. Uniforms similar to those in gogue in Tzarist days will be compulsory for all boys and girls as well as for male and female teachers.   From the age of twelve boys will undergo full military training not merely cadet corps training once a week and a route march once a term . This will consist of drill small-arms.   maching-gun ... /, -9   machine-gun and automatic rifle training. Likely students will be selected for the specialised'' services. Girls will receive first aid instruction training in all forms of w/T and search-light maintenance drill telephone service and domestic science. The military training of boys and girls is   to be fitted into the general curriculum and to have precedence over the usual training. The reform is in fact the militarisa tion of the nation in essence and has been extremely -well received by the scholastic world parents and the general public. It is felt that the five years' training at schools will cut down the universal conscription service considerably in peace-time and tend to interfere less with the studies of those at universities and polytechnics during the most critical stage of education.   The Immediate Future   The Red forces have no illusions about the critical time before them especially between April and November of this year. In the minds of Russians there is a fear of big reverses that Leningrad Moscow Rostov Stalingrad may yet go and the Caucasus be invaded. They know full well what that will mean to the Soviet Union and to the length of the war.   Have the Allies any real conception of what a defeat on such a scale would mean to the United Nations or of the price they might have to pay for it   Prom personal observation over the last month spent in London I would say the reply is in the negative. Whether this opinion is right or wrong I'd put on record that my last words to my second-in-command were You will remember that we have a plan for leaving Moscow in an emergency. sVhen necessary put it into      operation -I'll back you if Moscow Is not taken. It must be remembered that Moscow is still in danger. Red Services' Feelings towards the Allies    1 Very apathetic as a whole.  2 The only service that has a high regard for anything British is the Soviet Navy. It has respect for Britain and coopera tion between us is comparatively easy. However the Soviet Navy ... /, -10-   Navy is insignificant and has but little influence on   public opinion in U.S.S.R. Alas it is only they who   have even a mild conception of what it means to keep the   seas open.    3 The Soviet Air Force views the British and Allied force  quite wrongly -sic -with tolerance.  4 The Red Army is not encouraged to think about the Allied land forces. Of late there has however been a slight recognition of the 8th Army's achievement but no more.  5 The Soviet military services do appreciate allied tanks aircraft stores equipment and medical supplies. Away from staff commands this appreciation is freely voiced. There is widespread feeling among the Higher Command among the Government semi-government press and intelli-gensia of Russia that it is the considered policy of Britain and America   to let Russia and the Axis fight it out between them in order   that they may exhaust each other. The Soviet impression is   that Britain and America reason May they both be weakened and then we shall be strong at the Peace Conference.11   I regret to put on record that in my four weeks' stay in Britain I have found evidence of thought ih many spheres that would seem to support this unfortunate Soviet opinion. This seems most regrettable it is possibly due to lack of a clear understanding of British and American peace aims.   The Russians are difficult tiresome and uncouth 'swabs'.' They have however blunted the nose of the Axis land forces in the fight for tiieir existence. Of this they are very conscious and this fact explains a good deal of their arrogance and their inferiority complex makes up for the rest.   But it is clearly in British interests to encourage them to a continued resistence and it should be the paramount concern of British policy to do so.   The Future of the Red Forces Accepting as one must that the United Nations mil win the war it is clear that Soviet Russia will be one of the three   victorious ... /, -11   victorious powers.   In the opinion of the writer -however much Russia may be bled in reaching the victorious stage she will come to the Peace Conference backed whether we Britons and Americans like it or not with a huge strong and experienced fighting land force a well-equipped and trained mechanical tank arm and a fair air force.   Soviet Russia is the only European power which will be prepared in the future to maintain such a conscript Army permanently in commission and be in a financial position to do so.   Those who think as many U.S.A. representatives do that at the end of the war the Soviet armed forces will take change and force an issue demanding conditions and a land fit for heroes to live in and turn out the present governing and Soviet State machinery are wishful thinkers. The Red Army will not do it.   What Finland Poland Czechoslovakia Roumania and Turkey feel about the matter of Soviet military predominance will not affect the issue. What Britain and U.S.A. do now at the Peace Conference and thereafter will be the factor which wi. 11 govern the use of the Soviet Army of the future by the Government of Russia.

BRITAIN RUSSIA AND EUROPE   CONDITIONS OF CONTINENTAL SECURITY   THE LESSON OF HISTORY  From a Correspondent  Does it occur to American isolationists how English they are in their deep instinctive dislike of European entangle ments and commitments The Tory country gentlemen readily renounced the  uits of Marlborough s victories they were weary of the Continent and wished to be rid of it. The  wretched Electorate  of Hanover long remained a sore in British politics and a reproach it was a link with the Continent its welcome 'oss favourably reacted on the position of the dynasty in this country. In the nineteenth century Continental alliances were shunned and no policy could have been more English and more popular than  splendid isolation. The nation s energy and resources were not to be frittered away in unprofitable Continental squabbles. This in fact is the natural attitude of a nation intent on developing an empire or a continent of its own. It is shared by America and by the great Empire of Russia which in essence transcends urope and which over its inner develop ment or Asiatic expansion is apt at times to forget even the Balkans although to Russia for a number of reasons this is the most interesting region in Europe. No nation deeply engaged on the European Continent has managed to develop or retain wide extra-European territories and no nation engaged in developing such territories willingly lets itself be drawn into Continental affairs. But what we call Continental Americans call European and this island being a link and transmitter between Europe and North America the dislike of Europeanentanglements is liable to receive an anti- British colouring which certain American groups with strong European connexions try to enhance in their own un-American interest . Indeed the spiritual insularity of this country goes deeper than the pro fessed ignorance of American isolationists who have too rnuch of the European Continent in their midst.  RESISTANCE TO UNITY  There is a tradition of spiritual unity in Europe deriving from Rome. But when ever in the last three centuries a nation or dynasty tried to re-create this politically  establishing its own predominance over Western Christendom it met with the conscious and tenacious resistance of Eng  land and in defeating these threats to her own freedom and independence England has gained about half of White Man s land outside Europe for her language culture and tradition. Had Philip II of Spain been victorious no English-speak ing communities would have arisen in America. Had the Bourbons prevailed New England and Virginia might have suc cumbed to Quebec and Louisfana as New Amsterdam had to the English colonies. But so decisive was by 1806 Britain s naval superiority that the United States did not have to consider how the Napoleonic Empire would affect her own further development. In this century the German menace has placed our frontier on the Rhine and America s at Dover there are times when honest isolationists have to overcome their cherished and well founded dislikes.  Neither for good nor for evil has Europe ever been able to form a free union not even against the conquering Turk when religion and the common tradition seemed most to demand it. Euro pean cooperation can sometimes be achieved through a concert of the great Powers exercising a temperate measure of [control. But integral European union  would require coercion. Before 1795 attempts at universal dominion were un successful for there was a fair balance between the contending systems. In 1810.  or the first time the entire European ntinent from the Channel Ports to the frontiers of Russia was under one ruler. Even so potential centres of independent strength endured on the Continent and in 1813-15 the two Germanic Powers  Empires. But Russia's collapse in the years 1917-20 was unfortunately allowed to obscure her past performance and her future importance while the pacifist isola tionism of ihe Anglo-Saxons well-nigh eliminated their influence from the Euro pean Continent.  After 1922 France much inferior in her power-potential to any of the three Empires as also to Germany had the Con tinent to herselfa weight far beyond her strength to carry and the system into which she now glided during Russia s temporary eclipse recalled that which had existed before Russia emerged as a great Power. In the seventeenth century Sweden Poland and Turkey were France s eastern counterpoise to the Greater Ger many of the Habsburgs but they changed into a liability when under Peter the Great Russia entered the European arena and engaged in conflict with the three. And when in the second half of the eighteenth century the two Germanic Powers joined hands with Russia France withdrew dis tant and single-handed she could not be effective. Napoleon s victories carried him into Eastern Europe-to his own destruc tion. He succumbed in the conflict with Russia which he had tried his best to avoid. Experience proves most emphati cally that no Western Power however great can safely act on the eastern flank of Germany except in a genuine and close understanding with Russia.  DIVIDED NATIONS  The Continental nations hopelessly divided are now no match for Germany especially if she manages to enlist the sympathy of one of the three extra- European white Empires. The League of  Nations was to have supplied the frame work of a peace systembut who was to work it Russia defeated and Bolshevist estranged from her allies was abandoned by them and mutilated by her neighbours the United States withdrew from Europe France with an unresisting automatism lapsed into that system from which during the preceding 200 years even in the days of her prepotency she had consciously recoiled and'Great Britain realizing the folly of the French system tried to limit her commitments to Western Europe as if international affairs involving the balance of power on the Continent could be transacted in water-tight compartments. Naturally every State tried to use the  League of Nations for its own policies  and purposes France and her satellites  to collect a maximum of  binding   guarantees for the frontiers drawn by  them in 1919 and 1920 Germany to re  enter the concert of Europe as one of  the great Powers Russia to construct  a system of collective security against the  Nazis who noisily paraded their anti-  Russian designs. Great Britain s purpose  in the League was innocent and pathetic  to look wise and virtuous without much  exertionto attain the unbough ease of  life. We were pacifists and isolationists   there is affinity between the desire for  peace and the wish to be left alone. To  escape Continental entanglements we went  into the League of Nationsa paradoxical  pursuitand many a distinguished British  champion of the League felt deep down  in his heart how beautiful it would fee  were there no foreigners in it More  over Parliamentary forms in League  transactions were apt to reassure and mis  lead Englishmenpeople seldom inquire  how things work with which they have  been familiar all their lives. On the' Par  liamentary analogy an efficacy was sub  consciously ascribed to votes and ve'rdicts  of .Council and Assembly which could not  have been reasonably asserted.  A LASTING BASIS The shams illusions and neglects of the 20 years 1919-1939 must not be repro duced after this war. If rest is to come to Europe and a period of peaceful and productive development to the very much wider White Man s lands outside if an end is now to be made of the German menace and Europe is to be resettled on  played a part hardly inferior to that of a lasting basis this basis must be sought Great Britain and Russia. In 1914-18 in an association between the three great French resistance was of supreme import extra-European Empires and European ance still it was the joint weight of nations which seek peace and not adven Russia and the two English-speaking ture but the necessary antecedent to Empires which accomplished Germany s regional arrangements is a truly close defeat the balance qf population and collaboration between the three Empires. power had already shifted to a marked de Disunion between them and their with gree against the purely European nations. drawal from Europe annulled the victory and in favour of the extra-European of 1918.,  T/rtES 10.3.4-3. SECURITY IN EUROPE  Two lessons are to be drawn from the historical analysis of British policy in Europe which appears on this page this morning. The first is the familiar one that splendid isolation  has ceased to be a safe or practicable policy for Great Britain now that the nineteenth-century balance of power within the continent itself has been destroyedand to all seeming irrevoc ably destroyedby the inexorable march of military and economic development  towards larger and more complex forms of organization. The second and less familiar lesson relates specifically to Russia and is two-sided. In the first place Russia s attempts to isolate herself from the troubles of the European continent the last made as recently as 1939have proved as futile and as disastrous as similar attempts by Great Britain.  Secondly Britain has the same interest as Russia herself in active and effective Russian participation in continenla affairs for there can be no security in Western Europe unless there is also security in Eastern Europe and security in Eastern Europe is unattainable unless it is buttressed by the military power of Russia. Security in Europe cannot be achieved by any single stroke however overwhelming. The proposition that it is  impossible to exterminate the German people or destroy the German State has  behind it the authority of M. Stalin him self. The realization of security will depend on the joint and continuous vigi lance of Britain and Russia. If either one of them remains aloof or reverts to policies of isolation the domination of Europe by Germany becomes once more inevitable. 1 s A case so clear and cogent for close cooperation between Britain and Russia after the war cannot fail to carry con viction to any open and impartial mind. Yet its impact has undoubtedly been retarded and weakened on both sides by prejudices and suspicions left by recent history. To ignore them or to pretend that they do not exist is to render a poor  service to' Anglo-Russian friendship. There is a small minority of people in this country who undeterred by the thought of  playing into Hitler s hands are still  impressed by the  Bolshevist bogy  just as there is probably a smalf minority of Russians who still believe that British capitalism is a standing menace to Soviet Russia. Unfortunately the harm done by these minorities depends not on their numerical strength or on their influence which is ihsignificant but on the amount of suspicion which the mere fact of their existence can excite on the other side. Hitler s  Bolshevist bogy  propaganda is a two-edged weapon more cunningly forged than appears at first sight. If he failsas he has already failedto induce Britain and America to abate an iota of their determination to crush and obliterate Hitlerism and all its works he still hopes  to sow distrust between his eastern and western foes by fanning Russian appre hensions that Britain and America will presently seek to rob Russia of the fruits of her victory. Hitler s chances of making mischief have been swollen by official hesitations both in Britain and in America to recognize that Russia will at the moment of a victory so largely due to her outstanding effort enjoy the same right as her allies to judge for herself of the con ditions which she deems necessary for the security of her frontiers.  A study of the historical background  rves to illtiminate the character of Russian apprehensions and to make these pprehensions comprehensible to her Hies. Russia as well as Germany was .xcluded from the last peace settlement [and the corollary was an attempt to build up security to the east of Germany on the asis of a combination of minor States [under the aegis of the Western Powers. Excuses can be found for those who com mitted this cardinal blunder in 1919. There [would be no excuse for advocating its repetition to-day. The sequel irrefutably proved that security in that region cannot be assured for any nation by any grouping of minor countries or by support given to any such grouping from the West. In the words of our correspondent  no  Western Power however great can  safely act on the eastern flank of Ger many except in a genuine and close  understanding with Russia. The mere threat of intervention there by the Western [Powers produced the Rapallo Treaty of 1922 just as the Franco-British undertak ing to Poland given independently of Russia in April 1939 led to the German- Russian agreement in August of that fatal  ear. It would be inexcusableand in the ong run suicidalif British and American talesmen failed to read the lesson which hese facts convey. To suppose that Britain and the United States with the aid f some of the ledger European Powers ould maintain permanent security in  [Europe through a policy which alienated Russia and induced her to disinterest her- If in continental affairs would be sheer  Imadness.  These considerations point to two essen tial tasks which must engage British dip lomacy at the present time. The first is to develop a spirit of growing confidence in relations between Britain and Russia. Success in this task will no doubt depend as much on military achievement as on diplomatic skill. But it will in no cir cumstances be complete or lasting unless ungrudging and unqualified agreement is attained between the two countries on the future conditions of security in Europe. Four Great Powers as Mr. Eden said in his speech last December will have  a virtual monopoly of armed  strength  when the war ends and this armed strength must be used in the  name of the United Nations to prevent  a repetition of aggression. Of these four Powers only two are situated on the  I confines of Europe and on these two I rests a pre-eminent responsibility for I European security. This is the sense and Isignificance of the Eden-Molotov treaty lof May last. If Britain s frontier is on Ithe Rhine -it might just as pertinently be Isaid though it has not in fact been said Jlhaf Russia's frontier is on the Oder land in the same sense. This does not Imean that Russia any more than Britain Idesires to assail the independence of other Icountries or to control their domestic laffairs. On the contrary it must stand Ito reason that Russian security will best I be served by an understanding with peoples who have therrfselves good cause to. look to Russia for security against any Irepetition of the grim experience of Nazi Idomination and whose relations with the Soviet Union are founded upon a solid basis of contentment and good will. The sole interest of Russia is to assure herself   that her outer defences are in sure hands  and this interest will be best served if the lands between her frontiers and those 'f  Germany are held by governments a  peoples friendly to herself. That is t ane condition on which Russia must a will insist. Everything goes to show tl she will be in a position after the war Ishape the settlement on lines consiste  with this conception of what her securi Idemands. But it will make all the d llerence to the future of Anglo-RussiImendship whether these lines have be Ifreely approved and welcomed by Brita jin advance or whether they are grudging laccepted as a fait accompli after the v  tory has been won.  The other task of British foreign poli liS to interpret to the United States t Icommon interest of Britain and Russia   European security and in the means  attaining it. As Mr. Herbert Morrisi Isaid in his recent speech  we may be at I to play a part in developing and ccmei mg relations of friendship between o two great alliesthe Russians a T Americans. But this part cannot Ipassive. Differences where they exi   will not be resolved or mitigated by t pusillanimity which refuses to make i Its mind one way or the other.

II  e S.W. 1. Sir. 24 A May 1943.  MY despatch No. 43 of the 30th April dwelt on the probability that no confederation in Eastern Europe could play an effective part in European politics unless it were affiliated to the Soviet Government and suggested that so long as the policy7 of this Government was as enigmatic as it now is it would be inconsistent with British interests that Russia should enjoy a sphere of influence extending from Danzig to the Egean and Adriatic Seas. The suppression of the Comintern on the 20th May may be considered to have brought to an end what was in the past the most objectionable phase of Soviet foreign policy and to entitle the Soviet Government to be regarded less distrustfully than formerly. It is not then without hesitation that I address this further despatch to you which also gives grounds for misgivings about the character and policy of the present rulers in Russia.  2. We do not know for certain who murdered a lot of Polish officers in the forest of Katyn in April and May 1940 but this at least is already clear that it was the scene of terrible events which will live long in the memory of the Polish nation. Accordingly I shall try to describe how this affair looks to my Polish friends and acquaintances of whom many had brothers and sons and lovers among those known to have been taken off just three years ago from the prison camps at Kozielsk Starobielsk and Ostashkov to an uncertain destination how it looks for instance to General Sikorski. who there lost Captain Fuhrman. his former A.D.C. and close personal friend to M. Morawski who lost a brother-inlaw called Zoltowski and a nephew or to M. Zaleski. who lost a brother and two cousins. 3. The number of Polish prisoners taken by the Russian armies when they invaded Poland in September 1939 was about 180.000. including police and gendarmerie and a certain number of civilian officials. The total number of army officers was round about 15 000. At the beginning of 1940 there were in the three camps named above round about 9.000 or 10.000 officers and 6 000 other ranks policemen and civil officials. Less public reference has been made to these 6 000 than to the 10 000 officers not because the Polish Government are less indignant about the disappearance of other ranks than about the disappearance of officers or were less insistent in enquiries for them but because the need of officers to command the Polish troops recruited in Russia was more urgent than the need to increase the total ration strength of the Polish army. There is no reason to suppose that these 6 000 other ranks and the police and the civilians were treated by the Soviet Government differently to the officers and mystery covers the fate of all. For the sake of simplicity however I shall write in this despatch only of the missing officers without specific reference to other ranks to police prisoners or to civilians. Of the 10 000 officers only some 3 000 or 4.009 were regular officers. The remainder were reserve officers who in peace time earned their living many with distinction in the professions in business and so on. 4. In March of 1940 word went round the camps at Kozielsk Starobielsk and Ostashkov that under orders from Moscow the prisoners were to be moved to camps where conditions would be more agreeable and that they might look forward to eventual release. All were cheered by the prospect of a change from the rigours which prisoners must endure to the hazards and vicissitudes of relative freedom in Soviet or German territory. Even their captors seemed to wish the prisoners well who were now daily entrained in parties of 50 to 350 for the place at which so they hoped the formalities of their discharge would be completed. As each prisoner was listed for transfer all the usual particulars about him were rechecked and reregistered. Fresh finger-prints were taken. The prisoners were inoculated afresh and certificates of inoculation furnished to [4249] B, 2   them. Sometimes the prisoners Polish documents were taken away but in many such cases these were returned before departure. All were furnished with rations for the journey and as a mark of special regard the sandwiches furnished to senior officers were wrapped in clean white papera commodity seldom seen anywhere in Russia. Anticipations of a better future were clouded only by the fact that 400 or 500 Poles had been listed for further detention first at Pavlishchev Bor and eventually at Griazovetz. These were as it turned out later to be the only known survivors of the lost legion and some of them are in England now but at the time although no principle could be discovered on which they had been selected they supposed that they had been condemned to a further period of captivity and some even feared that they had been chosen out for execution.  5. Our information about these events is derived for the most part from those routed to Griazovetz all of whom were released in 1941 and some of whomnotably M. Komarnicki the Polish Minister for Justiceare now in  England.  6. Entrainment of the 10 000 officers from the three camps went on all through April and the first half of May and the lorries lined with cheerful faces which took them from camp to station were in fact the last that was ever seen of them alive by a ny witness to whom we have access. Until the revelations made by the German broadcast of the 12th April 1943 and apart from a few words let drop at the time by the prison guards only the testimony of scribblings on the railway wagons in which they were transported affords any indication of their destination. The same wagons seem to have done a shuttle service between Kozielsk and the detraining station and on these some of the first parties to be transported had scratched the words  Don t believe that we are going home  and the news that their destination had turned out to be a small station near Smolensk. These messages were noticed when the vans returned to Smolensk station and have been reported to us by prisoners at Kozielsk who were later sent to Griazovetz. 7. But though of positive indications as to what subsequently happened to the 10 000 officers there was none until the grave at Katyn was opened there is now available a good deal of negative evidence the cumulative effect of which is to throw serious doubt on Russian disclaimers of responsibility for the massacre. 8. In the first place there is the evidence to be derived from the prisoners correspondence in respect to which information has been furnished by officers families in Poland by officers now with the Polish army in the Middle East and by the Polish Red Cross Society. Up till the end of March 1940 large numbers of letters had been despatched which were later received by their relatives from the officers confined at Kozielsk Starobielsk and Ostashkov whereas no letters from any of them excepting from the 400 moved to Griazovtez have been received by anybody which had been despatched subsequent to that date. The Germans overran Smolensk in July 1941 and there is no easy answer to the question why if any of the 10 000 had been alive between the end of May 1940 and July 1941 none of them ever succeeded in getting any word through to their families. 9. In the second place there is the evidence of the correspondence between the Soviet Government and the Polish Government. The first request for information about the 10 000 was made by M. Kot of M. Wyshinsky on the 6th October 1941. On the 3rd December 1941 General Sikorski backed up his enquiry with a list of 3 845 names of officers included among them. General Anders furnished the Soviet Government with a further list of 800 names on the 18th March 1942. Enquiries about the fate of the 10 000 were made again and again to the Russian Government verbally and in writing by General Sikorski M. Kot M. Romer Count Raczynski and General Anders between October 1941 and April 1943. The Polish Red Cross between August and October 1940 sent no less than 500 questionnaires about individual officers to the Russian Govern ment. To none of all these enquiries extending over a period of two and a half years was a single positive answer of any kind ever returned. The enquirers were told either that the officers had been released or that  perhaps they are already in Germany or that  no information  of their whereabouts was avail able or M. Molotov to M. Kot October 1941 that complete lists of the prisoners were available and that they would all be delivered to the Polish authorities  dead or alive. But it is incredible that if any of the 10.000 were released not one of them has ever appeared again anywhere and it is almost equally incredible if they were not released that not one of them should have escaped subsequent to May 1940 and reported himself to the Polish authorities in Russia, 3   or Persia. That the Russian authorities should have said of any Polish officer in Soviet jurisdiction that they had  no information  also provokes incredulity for it is notorious that the N.K.V.D. collect and record the movements of indi viduals with the most meticulous care.  10. In the third place there is the evidence of those who have visited the grave first a Polish commission including among others doctors journalists and members of the Polish Assistance Committee a former president of the Polish Academy of Literature and a representative of the Mayor of Warsaw secondly another Polish commission which included priests doctors and representatives of the Polish Red Cross Society thirdly an international commission. of criminologists and pathologists of which the personnel is given in Annex I. The report of this commission forms Annex II to this despatch and the reports of the two Polish commissions add little to it. It is deposed by all that several hundred identifications have been established. All this evidence would normally be highly suspect since the inspections took place under German auspices and the results reached us through German broadcasts. There are fair grounds for presuming that the German broadcasts accurately represented the findings of the commis sions that the commissions findings were at any rate in some respects well founded and that the grounds were sound on which at any rate some of the identifications were made. 11. In the fourth place there is the fact that a mass execution of officer prisoners would be inconsistent with what we know of the German army. The Germany army has committed innumerable brutalities but the murder by them of prisoners of war even of Poles is rare. Had the German authorities ever had these 10 000 Polish officers in their hands we can be sure that they would have placed some or all of them in the camps in Germany already allotted to Polish prisoners while the 6 000 other ranks policemen and civil officials would have been put to forced labour. In such case the Polish authorities would in the course of two years certainly have got into touch with some of the prisoners but in fact none of the men from Kozielsk Starobielsk or Ostashkov have ever been heard of from Germany. 12. Finally there is the evidence to be derived from the confusion which characterises explanations elicited from or volunteered by the Soviet Government. Between August 1941 and the 12th April 1943 when the Germans announced the discovery of the grave at Katyn the Russian Government had among other excuses maintained that all Polish officers taken prisoner in 1939 had been released. On the other hand in conversation with the Polish Ambassador a Russian official who had drunk more than was good for him once referred to the disposal of these officers as  a tragic error. On the 16th April immediately after the German announcement the Soviet Information Bureau in Moscow suggested that the Germans were misrepresenting as victims of Russian barbarity skeletons dug up by archaeologists at Gniezdowo which lies next door to Katyn. On the 26th April M. Molotov in a note to the Polish Ambassador in Moscow said that the bodies at Katyn were those of Poles who had at one time been prisoners of the Russians but had subsequently been captured by the Germans in their advance at Smolensk in July 1941 and had been murdered then by them. On a later occasion and when the German broadcasts gave reason to think that some bodies were sufficiently well preserved to be identifiable the Russian Govern ment put forward a statement that the Polish officers had been captured by the Germans in July 1941 had been employed upon construction work and had only been murdered shortly before the German discovery was announced. This confusion cannot easily be understood except on the assumption that the Russian Government had something to hide. 13. The cumulative effect of this evidence is as I said earlier to throw serious doubt on Russian disclaimers of responsibility for a massacre. Such doubts are not diminished by rumours which have been current during the last two and a half years that some of the inmates of Kozielsk Starobielsk and Ostashkov had been transported towards Kolyma Franz Joseph Land or Novaya Zemlya some or all of these being killed en route. It may be that this was so and it may be that some less number than ten thousand odd were destroyed and buried at Katyn but whether the massacre occurred if it did occur in one place or two places or three places naturally makes no difference to Polish sentiments. These will accordingly be described without reference to the uncertainty which exists as to the exact number of victims buried near Smolensk. 14. With all that precedes in mind it is comprehensible that the relatives and fellow-officers of the men who disappeared should have concluded that these had in fact been murdered by their Russian captors and should picture their [42-49] ' B 2, last hourssomewhat as followswith bitter distress. The picture is a composite one to which knowledge of the district the German broadcasts experience of Russian methods and the reports of visitors to the grave have all contributed but it is not so much an evidentially established description of events as a reconstruction in the light of the evidencesometimes partial and obviously defectiveof what may have happened. But itor something like it-is what most Poles believe to have happened and what I myself in the light of all the evidence such as it is incline to think happened. Many months or years may elapse before the truth is known but because in the meantime curiosity is unsatisfied and judgment in suspense we cannot even if we wouldand much less can Polesmake our thoughts and feelings unresponsive to the dreadful probabilities of the case.  15. Smolensk lies some 20 kilom. from the spot where the common graves were discovered. It has two stations and in or near the town the main lines from Moscow to Warsaw and from Riga to Orel cross and recross each other. Some 15 kilom. to the west of Smolensk stands the unimportant station of Gniezdowo and it is but a short mile from Gniezdowo to a place known locally as Kozlinaya Gora or  The Hill of Goats. The district of Katyn in which this little hill stands is covered with primeval forest which has been allowed to go to rack and ruin. The forest is mostly coniferous but the pine trees are interspersed here and there with hardwoods and scrub. The month of April normally brings spring to this part of the country and by early May the trees are green but the winter of 1939-40 had been the hardest on record and when the first parties from Kozielsk arrived on the 8th April there would still have been occasional patches of snow in deep shade and of course much mud on the rough road from the station to the Hill of Goats. At Gniezdowo the prison vans from Kozielsk Starobielsk and Ostashkov discharged their passengers into a barbed-wire cage surrounded by a strong force of Russian soldiers and the preparations made here for their reception must have filled most of the Polish officers with disquiet and some indeed with dismay who remembered that the forest of Katyn had been used by the Bolsheviks in 1919 as a convenient place for the killing of many Czarist officers. For such was the case and a Pole now in London Janusz Laskowski tells me that when he was eleven years old he had to listen every evening to an account of his day s work from one of the executioners Afanaziev who was billeted in his mother s house. From the cage the prisoners were taken in lorries along a country road to the Hill of Goats and it must have been when they were unloaded from the lorries that their hands were bound and that dismay gave way to despair. If a man struggled it-seems that the executioner threw his coat over his head tying it round his neck and leading him hooded to the pit s edge for in many cases a body was found to be thus hooded and the coat to have been pierced by a bullet where it covered the base of the skull. But those who went quietly to their death must have seen a monstrous sight. In the broad deep pit their comrades lay packed closely round the edge head to feet like sardines in a tin but in the middle of the grave disposed less orderly. Up and down on the bodies the executioners tramped hauling the dead bodies about and treading in the blood like butchers in a stockyard. When it was all over and the last shot had been fired and the last Polish head been punctured the butchersperhaps trained in youth to husbandryseem to have turned their hands to one of the most innocent of occupations- smoothing the clods and planting little conifers all over what had been a shambles. It was of course rather late in the year for transplanting young trees but not too late for the sap was beginning to run in the young Scots pines when three years later the Polish representatives visited the site.  16. The climate and the conifers are not without significance. The climate of Smolensk accounts for the fact that though the Germans first got wind of the existence of the mass graves in the autumn of 1942 it was only in April of 1943 that they published to the world an account of what had been unearthed. The explanation is surely this not that the German propagandists had chosen a politically opportune moment for their revelations but that during the winter the ground at Smolensk is frozen so hard that it would have been impossible to uncover corpses without dynamite or such other violent means as would have destroyed the possibility of identifying dead bodies. The winter of 1942-43 was exceptionally mild and the German authorities probably got to work as soon as the soil was sufficiently soft. The little conifers also deserve more attention than they have received. In the first place they are presumptive evidence of Russian guilt for considering the conditions under which the German army advanced through Smolensk in July 1941 in full expectation of early and complete, m 5  victory it is most unlikely if the Polish officers had been murdered by Germans and not Russians that the Germans would have bothered to cover up their victims graves with young trees. In the second place one of these young trees under examination by a competent botanist would reveal beyond any possibility of doubt whether it had last been transplanted in May 1940 or some time subsequent to July 1941. Perhaps this test of Russian veracity will presently be made.  17. The political background against which the events described in paragraph 15 are viewed by Poles is by contrast a matter of undisputed history including as it does all the long story of partitions rebellions and repressions the Russo-Polish war of 1919-20 the mutual suspicions which this left behind it the unannounced invasion of Poland by Russia in September 1939 the subsequent occupation of half Poland by Russia and the carrying into captivity of some million and a half of its inhabitants. Moie recently comes the virtual annexation of the occupied eastern parts of Poland the refusal of the Russian Government to recognise as Polish citizens the inhabitants of the occupied districts the suppression of relief organisations for Poles in Russia and the persecution of Poles refusing to change their own for Russian nationality. When Poles learned that in addition to all these misfortunes round about 10 000 men of the best breeding stock in Poland had according to Russian accounts been either dispersed and  lost  somewhere in the Soviet Union or else abandoned to the advancing German armies or had according to German accounts been found to have been murdered by the Russians many of them naturally concluded  though I do not here give it as my own conclusion that the Soviet Government s intention had been to destroy the very foundations upon which their own Poland could be rebuilt. This sinister political intention imputed by Poles to Russia poisoned the wound and enhanced the sufferings of a nation already outraged and dismayed by the conduct of the Soviet Government. Some Poles remembering Lenin s attitude to the holocausts of 1917 and subsequent years and probing the dark recesses of Stalin s mind when he took if take he did the dreadful decision compare disciple with master. Lenin would have broken apart the heads of ten thousand Polish officers with the insouciance of a monkey cracking walnuts. Did corpses pitching into a common grave with the precision of machines coming off a production-belt similarly satisfy a nature habituated to manipulate blood and lives with uncompassionate detachment Some at any rate so interpret Stalin s mind.  These men are no use to us  they imagine him as saying  in fact they are a nuisance and a danger. Here is an elite of talent here is valour and a hostile purpose. These stallions must not live to sire a whole herd of hostile Christian thoroughbreds. Many of the brood-mares have already been sold to Siberian peasants and the camel-pullers of Kazakstan. Their foals and yearlings can be broken to Communist harness. Rid me of this stud farm altogether and send all this turbulent bloodstock to the knackers. 18. The men who were taken to Katyn are dead and their death is a very serious loss to Poland. Nevertheless unless the Russians are cleared of the presumption of guilt the moral repercussions in Poland in the other occupied countries and in England of the massacre of Polish officers may well have more enduring results than the massacre itself and this aspect of things therefore deserves attention. As I have as yet seen no reliable reports on public feeling in Poland and German-occupied Europe my comments will relate only to our own reaction to the uncovering of the graves. 19. This despatch is not primarily concerned with the reaction of the British public press or Parliament who are not in such a good position as His Majesty s Government to form an opinion as to what actually happened. We ourselves on the other hand who have access to all the available information though we can draw no final conclusions on vital matters of fact have a considerable body of circumstantial evidence at our disposal and I think most of us are more than half convinced that a large number of Polish officers were indeed murdered by the Russian authorities and that it is indeed their bodies  as well maybe as other bodies which have now been unearthed. This being so I am impelled to examine the effect on myself of the facts and allegations and to adjust my mind to the shocking probabilities of the case. Since the Polish Government is in London and since the affair has been handled directly by yourself and the Prime Minister with General Sikorski and Count Raezyinski it may seem redundant for me to comment on it as I should naturally do were the Polish Government and I both abroad but though all important conversa tions have been between Ministers and the leaders of the Polish Government my contacts have doubtless been more numerous than yours during the last few weeks, 6   with Poles of all kinds and they have possibly spoken to me with less reserve than to yourself. I hope therefore I may without impertinence submit to you the reflections which follow.  20. In handling the publicity side of the Ka tyn affair we have been constrained by the urgent need for cordial relations with the Soviet Government to appear to appraise the evidence with more hesitation and lenience than we should do in forming a common-sense judgment on events occurring in normal times or in the ordinary course of our private lives we have been obliged to appear to distort the normal and healthy operation of our intellectual and moral judgments we have been obliged to give undue prominence to the tactlessness or impulsiveness of Poles to restrain the Poles from putting their case clearly before the public to discourage any attempt by the public and the press to probe the ugly story to the bottom. In general we have been obliged to deflect attention from possibilities which in the ordinary affairs of life would cry to high heaven for elucidation and to withhold the full measure of solicitude which in other circumstances would be shown to acquaintances situated as a large number of Poles now are. We have in fact perforce used the good name of England like the murderers used the little conifers to cover up a massacre and. in view of the immense importance of an appearance of Allied unity and of the heroic resistance of Russia to Germany few will think that any other course would have been wise or right. 21. This dislocation between our public attitude and our private feelings we may know to be deliberate and inevitable but at the same time we may perhaps wonder whether by representing to others something less than the whole truth so far as we know it and something less than the probabilities so far as they seem to us probable we are not incurring a risk of whatnot to put a fine point on itmight darken our vision and take the edge off our moral sensibility. If so how is this risk to be avoided 22. At first sight it seems that nothing less appropriate to a political despatch than a discourse upon morals can be imagined but yet. as we look at the changing nature of the international world of to-day it seems that morals and international politics are becoming more and more closely involved with each other. This proposition has important consequences but since it is not universally accepted I hope the following remarks in support of it are not out of place. 23. Nobody doubts that morals now enter into the domestic politics of the United Kingdom but it was not always so. There was a time when the acts of the Government in London were less often the fruit of consultation and compromise in the general interests of all than of the ascendancy of one class or group of citizens who had been temporarily successful in the domestic arena. It was realisation of the interdependence of all classes and groups of the population of England Scotland and Wales which discouraged the play of intestine powerpolitics and set the welfare of all above the advantage of the strong. Similar causes are producing similar results in the relations of States to each other.  During the last four centuries of our modern era  writes Professor Pollard the last word in political organisation has been the nation but now that the world is being unified by science and culture  the conception of the nation state as the largest group in which human beings are organically associated with each other is being superseded by the conception of a larger it may be of a European or indeed of a world-wide unit 7 and the nation is taking its place as the bridge the half-way house between the individual and the human family. Europe and indeed the world are in process of integrating themselves and  the men and women of Britain  as you said at Maryland  are alive to the fact that they live in one world with their neighbours. This being so. it would be strange if the same movement towards the coalescence of smaller into larger groups which brought about the infiltration of morals into domestic politics were not also now bringing about the infiltration of morals into international politics. This in fact it seems to many of us is exactly what is happening and is why as the late Mr. Headlam Morley said  what in the international sphere is morally indefensible generally turns out in the long run to have been politically inept. It is surely the case that many of the political troubles of neighbouring countries and some of our own have in the past arisen because they and we were incapable  of seeing this or unwilling to admit it.  24. If then morals have become involved with international politics if it be the case that a monstrous crime has been committed by a foreign Government albeit a friendly one and that we for however valid reasons have been obliged to behave as if the deed was not theirs may it not be that we now stand in danger, of bemusing not only others but ourselves of falling as Mr. Winant said recently at Birmingham under St. Paul s curse on those who can see cruelty  and burn not  If so and since no remedy can be found in an early alteration of our public attitude towards the Katyn affair we ought maybe to ask ourselves how consistently with the necessities of our relations with the Soviet Government the voice of our political conscience is to be kept up to concert pitch. It may be that the answer lies for the moment only in something to be done inside our own hearts and minds where we are masters. Here at any rate we can make a compensatory contributiona reaffirmation of our allegiance to truth and justice and compassion. If we do this we shall at least be predisposing ourselves to the exercise of a right judgment on all those half political half moral questions  such as the fate of Polish deportees now in Russia which will confront us both elsewhere and more particularly in respect to Polish-Russian relations as the war pursues its course and draws to its end and so if the facts about the Katyn massacre turn out to be as most of us incline to think shall we vindicate the spirit of these brave unlucky men and justify the living to the dead.

The report of the international commission of scientists on the examination of the mass graves at Katyn Wood in the main section reads as follows From the 28th April to the 30th April 1943 a commission composed of leading representa tives of forensic medicine at European Universities and other prominent University professors of medicine have conducted a thorough scientific examina tion of the mass graves of Polish officers in Katyn Wood. The discovery of those mass graves which was recently brought to the attention of the German authorities prompted Reich s Chief Health Officer Dr. Conti to invite experts from various European countries to inspect the Katyn site in order thus to contri bute to the clarification of this unique case. Members of the commission person  ally heard the testimonies of several Russian native witnesses who among others confirmed that during the months of March and April. 1940 almost daily big railway transports with Polish officers arrived at the station of Gniesdovo near, 8   Katyn where the Polish officers alighted and were then transported in a prisoner motor van to Katyn Wood and were not seen again the commission further took cognisance of the discoveries and facts thus far established and inspected objects of circumstantial evidence. Accordingly up to the 30th April 1943 982 bodies were exhumed of which approximately 70 per cent have been identified while papers found on others must first be subjected to careful preliminary treatment before they can be used for identification. Bodies exhumed prior to the commis sion s arrival were all inspected and a considerable number of bodies were dissected by Professor Buhty and his assistants. Up to to-day seven mass graves have been opened the biggest of which is estimated to contain the bodies of 2 000 Polish officers. Members of the commission personally dissected nine corpses and submitted numerous specially selected cases to post-mortem. It was confirmed that all those so far exhumed died from bullets in their heads. In all cases bullets entered the nape. In the majority of cases only one bullet was fired. Two bullets were fired only rarely and only one case was found where three bullets had been fired into the nape. All the bullets were fired from pistols of less than eight mm. calibre. The spot where the bullets penetrated leads to the assumption that the shot was fired with the muzzle pressed against the nape or from the closest range. The surprising regularity of the wounds . . . permits the assumption that the shots were fired by experienced hands. Numerous bodies revealed a similar method of tying the hands and in some cases stabs from four-edged bayonets were found on bodies and clothes. The method of tying is similar to that found on the bodies of Russian civilians that were earlier exhumed in Katyn Forest. The assumption is justified that a ricochetted bullet first killed one officer then went into the body of one already dead in the pitthe shootings annarently being made in ditches to avoid having the bodies transported to graves. The mass graves are situated in clearings in the forest the ground being completely levelled off and planted with young pines. The mass graves were dug in undulating terrain which consists of pure sand in terraces the lowest going down as far as the ground water. Bodies lay practically without exception face down closely side by side and in layers one above the other clearly ledged methodically at the sides of pits and more irregularly in the centre. The uniforms of the exhumed bodies accord ing to the unanimous opinion of the commission were especially with regard to buttons rank insignia decorations form of boots etc. undoubtedly Polish. They had winter wear. Frequently furs leather coats knitted vests and typical Polish officers caps have been found. Only a few bodies were those of other ranks. One body was that of a priest. The measurements of the clothes correspond with the measurements of the wearer. No watches or rings were found on the bodies although from the exact date and time found in entries in several diaries the owners must have had these objects up to their last days even hours. Comments found on bodiesdiaries correspondence newspapersare from the period of the autumn of 1939 to March and April 1940. The latest hitherto established date is that of a Russian newspaper of the 22nd April 1940. There were varying degrees of decomposition of the bodies differing according to the position of the bodies within the grave and their juxtaposition to each other. A large number of skulls were examined for changes which according to the experiences of Professor Orsoa are of great importance for the determination of the time of death. These changes consist of various layers of calcareous tuft-like incrustation on the surface of the already loamy brain matter. Such changes are not to be observed on bodies that have been interred for less than three years. But this change was observed to a marked degree on the skull of the body No. 526 wffiich w-as found with a surface layer in one big mass grave., 7th June 1943 F/7767/85.  To C.D.

Simovic requested us not to send him back to Yugoslavia or   to have any further'dealings with.him.   Radovic was naturally annoyed and upset at being dropped by the British and he turned to the Russians' where we understand his sympathies always lay. He went to Russia with the intention we ung.crctand of getting them to send him back to Yugoslavia. Although this failed we do not.know how far he actually collaborated with the Soviet authorities.    Prom the foregoing you will see that it was at the direct request of-the Yugoslav Prime Minister that we .ceased to collaborate with him and I -do not think therefore there is any question of our failing to. make adequate use of him. 0O0, Your of 7th.

It will then be submitted to a committee to be set up by C.D. and will then go before the Council   b I attach a note which D/HV has written on Radovio as although his name arises in a report from Moscow of our dealings with him they have of course been through the D/H Section.

Nearlj/-two years ago we made an agreement with N.K.V.D. defining the respective territories in which we would work and providing for mutual assistance in certain respects. 2. Agreement was made with the approval of the Fpreign Office who have on various occasions emphasised the importance of helping Russia whenever political considerations allowed because in the absence of a recognised Second Front every gesture of help is valuable. 3. In spite of constant pressure from N.K.V.D. we have resisted requests to infiltrate their agents into Occupied Allied Countries because of the grave complications which would arise if it became known to the Governments of the Occupied Allied Countries. 4. Consequently our help to N.K.V.D. has been virtually limited to operations into enemy countries and even there our shortage of transport has limited results to a bare minimum. 5. N.K.V.D. had pressed us for months past to introduce Etna party as a matter of urgency and we had explored all possibilities including air transport and felucca from Gibralter both of which for various reasons proved impossible.   6. N.K.V.D. persistently refuse to accept our statements about shortage of transport and insist that there is political motive. The Foreign Office attach importance to dispelling such suspicions on the part of N.K.V.D. 7. For these reasons and in view of urgency of request from N.K.V.D. which recent events have proved justified we felt bound as a last resort to ask for help from C.-in-C. Mediterranean. 8. We did so reluctantly knowing how precious such facilities are.

With reference to F/402/85 to V/CD 1 attach herewith the minute which 3.0. required with regard to our arrangements with the Russians., COPY DP/RU/1639. 18th August 1943. To AD/0. From D/ p   In answer to VCD/357 of 14.8.43. I submit the following notes for the information of 3.0.   In September 1941 an Agreement was signed by 3.O.E. and the N.K.V.D. which laid down the terms upon which the signatories would assist one another in subversive action. As this Charter is well known to 3.0. I do not propose to quote any of it.   8   One of the terms of the Agreement was that both organisations should give mutual assistance in the introduction of their agents to enemy and enemy-occupied territory and it is this condition which governs our Pickaxe operations. There is nothing in the Agreement to prevent us asking for the same facilities from the Russians but the situation has not yet arisen when such a request has been necessary. The agent question has therefore been entirely one-sided.   In the last twelve months for political reasons bans have been placed on certain countries and we have had to inform the N.K.V.D. that no infiltrations can be made to these countries without agreement between the Soviet and the foreign government concerned. This particularly applies to France since the set-up of the National Committee of Liberation and the party of agents referred to in our General Intelligence paragraph has been refused pending the agreement of Andre phillipe to the operation. We ourselves told the N.K.V.D. that we could not accept them without written authority and the matter stands in abeyance for the moment.   The wording of the paragraph in question is some what misleading since there is no intention to suggest that the refusal of these French agents made it incumbent upon us to accept other parties for Germany and Italy. These parties were accepted, in the normal course of events and under the terms of our Charter   but their immediate aooeptance was decided upon in order in some way to balance the refusal of the Frenchmen. The fact   that we have a number of agents now awaiting operations is due mostly to limitations of the air and it is hoped that this   situation will improve in the near future. We shall of course   inform Moscow that pending a successful issue in respect of these agents now in this country we shall not accept other parties for   transfer to the U.K.   The reasons which make it advisable to continue with pickaxe operations are directly connected with the desirability of retaining our Mission in Moscow since were we to refuse to carry out any more operations I fear that the N.K.V.D. would at once ask for the removal of our Mission. Although this suppression of liaison with N.K.V.D. would not materially embarrass 3.O.E. at the same time the arguments in favour of keeping the Mission in Moscow from a general point of view are the most important since it is certain that SAM's Mission plays a great part in the furtherance of good relations with the Soviet. The Foreign Office and C on the advice of H.B.M. Ambassador to Moscow have   A   informed us that they do not desire any action to be taken which would jeopardise the Mission's position and our policy therefore at present is to give the maximum assistance to the N.K.V.D. in the in filtration of their agents. As long as our Charter exists I cannot see that we could so otherwise., 1st September 1943 To S.O. Prom AD/S.l   I understand from AD/S that you asked for a note on our arrangements with the Soviet Government regarding Pickaxes. Major Seddon has prepared a memorandum on this subject which is attached hereto., -7 SEP 1943   i '  Dyu l j [CIPHER] DEPRRIIffiHTAL NO.S   31/srroir MOSCOW TO FOREIGN OFFICE.   I ' r r --   Sir A.

I tried to-day to stir Molotov's interest in the matter but without much success. He took note of our urgent need of relief but said that Soviet Government were so short of aircraft that they could make no contribution to carriage of freight direct from Sweden.   2. He said that it had been conveyed informally to Soviet Government that Swedes were contemplating an air service but that he did not feel disposed at present to press them because aircraft would have to fly [ gp. omitted Y over] hostile territory and would presumably to do so unarmed.   I shall revert to the matter next time I see him.   5. O.T.P, 21st October 1943   I have just read the memorandum on Russia s aims and policy by S.O.E. Moscow reference PLANS/170/1396 of October 6th . Even at the risk of being considered parochial I would like to make one or two comments.   Surely no appreciation of this subject can be complete without reference to Finland which is a key country amongst the northern states and which has a common frontier with Russia as long as if not longer than any other country in Europe.   The memorandum which is in my opinion in other respects too somewhat incomplete makes absolutely no reference to any problem north of Estonia. I particularly asked D/P.101 when he was here recently what the present attitude of the Soviet Government was towards Finland. He replied vary shortly that if approached by the Finnish Government the Moscow Government would no doubt be willing to make peace on the terms of the Peace Treaty of March 1940 with the additional cession of Petsamo and the Aland   Islands. These are terms which in my opinion the   existing Finnish Government and High Command would find   totally unacceptable even after a possible withdrawal of   the German divisions at present in Finland. The Finns would oppose the almost inevitable Russian attack and would no doubt be over-run in the end and the Russians would gain their objectives and would thereby regain the   dominating position in the Baltic which they originally   lost at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. The feelings of the Swedes can be imagined on seeing the Russians back again on the Tornea River and in the   Aland/,  4   i  -3    . '-   Aland Islands only one hour or so away from Stockholm by air. Moreover Sweden would be faced with a sudden   f  influx of probably over a million Finnish refugees which would constitute a serious minority problem. There is the added danger that the Russians in their   C   anxiety to secure a warm water port on the Atlantic Sea   Board which is by no means a new idea will take   whatever steps they can to obtain facilities in Narvik or   some more northerly port such as Hammerfest   The three Scandinavian countries and Finland might well be described as the cleanest in Europe in every sens of the word. Economically they have been of very great importance both as exporters and importers not only to Great Britain but also to the United States and politically they have evolved forms of Government and social structure as near to true demooracy as have ever been or are likely to be encompassed by the human race., RUSSIA.   Memorandum on Russian aims and policy as appreciated by S.O.E. MOSCOW.   1. GENERAL. RUSSIA will insist on the incorporation of EST01TIALATVIA LITHUANIA and BESSARABIA in the   3   U.S.S.R. No compromise on these countries will he considered. Post-war RUSSIA will need above everything else to concentrate on the reconstruction of its own devastated territories for which purpose they contemplate using German forced labour on a large scale. Reconstruction will be.their first objective and will take a long time. They do not at present show any desire to create Communist satellite states in POLAND or GERMANY. They place the first emphasis on collective security which is necessary for reconstruction this point being brought --ouij clearly in discussionswith MAISKY and LITVINOV. 2. POLAND  a The Russians regard the Right Wing clique in the Polish Government as one of their main enemies. The reaction-of the Polish Government to GOEBBEL s campaign on the KATYN mass murders whatever justifi cation it might have has produced a strong and permanent effect on the Russian mind.    b The Polish Division which is being organized in RUSSIA is an Infantry Division intended to be used with Russian supporting arms and supply services. The Poles . in U.K.-have been sensible in ignoring the existence of this Division and it is most important that they should not make a fuss about it or attempt to outlaw the Poles who enlist in it. S.O.E. MOSCOW assume that the Russians have dropped agents in POLAND bum have no definite evidence.  NOTE It is known from other sources that a considerable number of agents have been dropped and that the RUSSIANS wrongly claim that their own agents have carried out most of the sabotage work which has in fact been directed by the Polish Secret Army-under orders from LONDON .    c Although the Russians have failure of the Poles'to carry out the maximum sabotage activity on German lines of communication it is known for a fact that ROMER the Polish Ambassador did lay before STALIN the Polish Big Plan for a mass rising in POLAND to disturb the lines of conmunication. STALIN said that he refused to allow the Polish people to sacrifice themselves under hopeless circumstances. Thrs fact is probably not known in RUSSIA except in very limited official circles. S CZECHOSLOVAKIA/, 3i   4.    5. 6. CZECHOSLOVAKIA    a The Czech Arribassc.dor is extremely close to the Russians. The recent arguments with Britain about the Russo-Czech alliance follow from a long past history. While it is true that an agreement vsp.s made between EDEN and MOLOTOV that neither party would make any alliances with European states until after the peace settlement in order to stop a scramble for spheres of influence the Russians maintain that they are at liberty to arabnd-.tthecagToqmen.t' and to   amplify itto-meetnew.conditions. .    b The Czech Brigade formed.in RUSSIA fought well as an Infantry Brigade at KHARKOV with Russian supporting arms and supply services. It is being expanded into an Infantry Division.  cT There is undoubtedly a regular route for escapees from CZECHOSLOVAKIA through occupied RUSSIA' to the Russian lines assisted on route by the various Partisan organizations. This route not only supplies recruits for the Czech Brigade but is also used in the reverse direction for infiltrating Russian organizers. There is no evidence available as to the extent of Russian control of resistance grouns im CZECHOSLOVAKIA.   HUNGRY AND RUMANIA.   The Russians do not appear to have any clear policy or particularly strong views on HUNGARY. They naturally have strong views about RUMANIA arid will insist on the return of BESSARABIA. They are not enthusiastic even about MANIU although they have stated that he is probably the most likely lender for the Allies to look to for collaboration   BULGARIA.   The Russians have of course traditional links with BULGARIA are not at war with her and still maintain diplomatic relations and a diplomatic mission. They have no doubt put in a good many agents and it is probable that if they could recapture the CRIMEA they would try to organize a descent on BULGARIA in order to clear the Germans out.   YUGOSLAVIA.   The Russians have always been violently opposed to MIHAILOVIC whemthey regard as a Fascist and a colla borator both with the Italians and the Germans. At the end of 1942 they asked S.O.E. to drop Russian agents to contact the Partisans in YUGOSLAVIA. The reply was that we would only do it if' MIHAILOVIC agreed. The Russians regarded this answer as a transparent and rather unsatis factory way of giving an outright refusal. Unfortunately   S.O.E. MOSCOW were not informed of the subsequent decision in February 1943 to send B.L.Os to the Yugoslav Partisans although this was not actually done until April 1943. Consequently when the Russians came to hear of it.they considered that they had had a very raw deal from the British and that our original reply to their request was insincere. There is no direct evidence of W/l communication between YUGOSLAVIA and MOSCOW although it can be inferred with reasonable certainty from the up to date and accurate information put out from the Free Yugoslav radio operating from TIFLIS. It is pointed out that apparently no attempts have been made to monitor this W/T traffic which is assumed to exist.   7. FRANCE /, 7. FRANCE Here too the Russians think that the British have put them off by every conceivable excuse owing to our insistence that Russian agents could only be infiltrated first with the approval of DE GAULLE and subsequently with the approval of the French National Committee.   The Russians also feel strongly about the way in v/hich Great Britain and America rushed them during the final arrangements for recognising the French National Committee This of course implies no criticism on the part of S.O.E. for clearly they do not appear on this level. It is a Russian criticism against the Foreign Office.   DISTRIBUTION C.D K/POL . Vjatf-AD/N   A/CD K/AIR.P AD/E 5 copies G.M.

R. 9.50 a m.B.S.T.6th November 1943. 888888 iMviEDIATE. DEDIP. In his telegrams from Moscow the [1 grp.omtd] [4 grps.undec.]  informed of all that passed at the conference. Now that it is  over and he has gone I would venture to make a few comments  2. Of the outstanding success of the conference and satisfaction it has given to all but our enemies there  can be no question. To us in the Embassy dogged though  we were in our belief that nothing but good could come of the  gathering of forthright men round a table the measure of this  success and happy atmosphere in which it was achieved -were all  the more gratifying .in that they came as somewhat of a surprise.  To foreign newspaper correspondents close observers of  whimsicalities of opinion' here .who had foretold amongst  themselves that the conference was bound to end in disaster  its results have been'bewildering.  3. If we search Lgrp.undec.] causes of present success we find I think that they lie in one or two simple truths  for the first time the Russians felt they had been admitted  freely and on terms of complete equality to the most intimate  councils of ourselves and the Americans from-which as they saw it they had hitherto been largely excluded.  4. The fact that two Foreign Secretaries of the prestigeof Hull and Eden had at this stage made long journey to this country for a full dress conference in their capital stirred  their vanity and completed the hazardous and courageous work done by the Prime Minister a year ago.  5. Then there is the fact which impressed us all and which only emerged as the Conference went on that some such  gathering was indeed a necessity to the Russians.  6. You will remember that an article in P.ravda of x October 13th see my telegram Ho.29 Space seemed to sound a note of  warning and led us here. Embassy and newspapers correspondentsalike to expect some net-. In fact there was none.  7. The Conference opened in an atmosphere of appropriate but unforced politeness and jocularity perhaps not wnolly spontaneous on the part of the Russians. The Chairmanship -was imposed upon a modest and protesting molotov. But once  he assumed it it soon became clear to us that it was the set /determination, 2 determination of the Russians to make the Conference  a success. Molotov conducted the proceedings with sustained  tact and skill and growing good humour deferring any matter  that seemed to threaten prickliness and only reverting to  it when its thorns had been drawn by talks over food and wine.  The way he handled the debates impelled our respect and in the  end our affection also. He has travelled a long 7/ay during  the past year and a half.  8. 'I have said that we felt turn the Soviet delegation were clearly surprised too by the  candour with which we and the Americans laid all our problems  both military and political before them.  9. It was a pleasure to note quite early in the proceedings the beginnings of real confidence in us and its growth as  the days passed and with this increasing gratification. Even 7/hen it was necessary to throw cold water on some of  their suggestions about means to shorten the war there were  signs of -no resentment only of disappointment and some sadness.  Both we and the Americans had looked forward to discussions  of this subject with an anxiety that proved to be unjustified.  10. This was I think mainly due to what I have attempted to describe in paragraph 3. The importance of the feeling of confidence  we have now provoked is I believe something that we cannot   too constantly bear in mind. It is a tangible achievement and  it is of the highest value. At the moment it looks  solid enough but it is delicately poised and we should be  careful to take no liberties with it even at the cost of  some forbearance by ourselves.  11. It was clear to me that the brunt of the burden fell upon the Secretary of Sfate for Foreign Affairs ably supported  by Mr.Strang and the success achieved..seemed to me to be  mainly due to his skill his disarming 12 grps.undec. mode  of approach] trust he inspired in the Russians and his  readiness to yield a point when it -was -wise to do so. At  the same time we must commend Molotov for recognising this.  The stateliness and fine presence of Mr.Hull who looked and  moved like a magnificent old eagle made as handsome a  contribution as did his rare interventions in debate.  We must also commend Molotov for the dexterity with which  having reached agreement with the Secretary of State he  swept Mr.Hull with all deference into acquiescence in the  decisions that had been taken.  12. On the military side General Ismay and General Deane played their very difficult part with convincing ability.  13. That Soviet Government are genuinely pleased there can be no kind of doubt more particularly since  some of their proposals about shortening the war have now  been met. This satisfaction is reflected not only in articles  in the newspapers to which I have drawn your attention/  but in columns of quotations from foreign press in praise of  what has happened in fact 8 or 10 of the major and minor  L grp.omtdj dined at the Embassy to celebrate something /that, 5 that has not happened for many years again in the  flocking to a reception I gave of a large number of Russians  who have hitherto shunned us. And finally in the completely  spontaneous ovation given to Mr.Eden by the audience at  the ballet the night before he left.  14. When I saw him this evening Molotov made it  clear that he was very satisfied and said that allusion to  the conference would be made by M.Stalin in his speech to  morrow. I await this with interest.  15. Please pass to Secretary of State if you think it desirable.

Following from Colonel Hill. Following for C.D. Personal. Decipher yourself.   a. On 17th December had a two hours talk with U.S.Ambassador at his invitation. First 90 minutes alone with him.   b. He informed me he had asked General Donovan and Colonel Haskell to visit Moscow. He expected their arrival almost immediately. The Ambassador then told me what he knew of the future. Apparently a lot. He also mentioned that General Donovan had been impressed by his visit to Station 17 in 1941. This had undoubtedly greatly helped in forming O.S.S. c. He asked my reaction to having a U.S.A. colleague in Moscow. I repeated to him what I told Hedley-Dent and O.S.S. representatives I had met in October last and my reasons for welcoming such a proposal. d. He asked me to advise him how best to approach the Russians. I counselled him to raise the question only on the highest level adding that General Donovan should not meet any Soviet officials until the Kremlin had had time to digest the proposals. Here I took the opportunity of mentioning the impression I had received from my talk some weeks ago with General Deane in which I gathered that neither he nor members of the U.S.A.Embassy had favoured presence of O.S.S. representative in Moscow. The Ambassador stated that the Teheran Conference had altered his opinion saying General Donovan's people helped to capture some of isalnds which or where unspecified Later on there is a great chance for him to collaborate with the Russians and yourselves in the Balkans where you are already so well established., 4  I ventured to observe to the iimbassador that no S.O.E.   joint policy could succeed without extensive preparation   and that I thought our Balkans programme now too advanced   for any work ad hoc.   e. The Ambassador then stated that Yugoslav question had been discussed with Molotov at Teheran. Latter had said U.S.S.R. would like to send a ''Military Mission to Partisans and was ready to send one to Mihailovic. Molotov was against Allies discarding Mihailovic until it was clear he could no longer help Allied cause. Pressed for more details about this conversation the Ambassador appeared at a loss adding that notes made by American interpreter afterwards were not very clear. He suggested that Major Birse might be more helpful. f. I expressed view that an O.S.S. representative would require some months to acclimatize himself and that best long term target for O.S.S. here was in the Far East. I added that I was fully aware of close co operation between our tvro organisations and would always do my utmost to help any American colleague in Moscoyj. g. Here Colonel Haskell was announced who informed the Ambassador that he hald left General Donovan  who has his own plane to spend one or two more days in ---before proceeding as encoded . h. It was clear that the Ambassador had had no previous opportunity of telling Colonel Haskell of his invitation to General Donovan. He showed some hesitation and Haskell received his explanation with a certain lack of enthusiasm. i. The Ambassador then recapitulated oiir conversation and again stressed the Balkan angle. Haskell observed that any O.S.S. officer in Moscow would be under his jurisdiction and said that when Donovan arrived he Yjould be able to arrange for me to meet him.

New York inform us that Donovan has undertaken the journey to Moscow unwillingly and only at the request of Harriman but it is possible that he hopes by enlisting the support of Harriman to persuade the otate Department to reverse their previous decision preventing him setting up a Mission in Moscow. B. An idea in October when you saw 0.3.8. was a joint Mission with the British and .Americans as close partners. This now appears quite impossible both from the Kussian and American point of view. He see no reason to oppose O.8.S. representation in Moscow and you should concentrate on arranging that the 0.3.3. Mission will be instructed to work in the closest possible relation with you.  G. For your guidance in any conversation with Donovan regarding the collaboration between ourselves 0.3.3. and the Russians the following should be borne in mind 1. Donovan since his visit to London Â±n Deptember has recently made a tour of Cairo New Delhi and Chungking and has had discussions on co-ordination of 0.3.3. activities with those of 8.0.E. including a long discussion with C.D. in Cairo. He has made it clear that he now considers 0.3.3. fully Hedged and is determined not to tolerate any tutelage from 3.O.E. and has indicated he does not consider himself bound by former agreements. He intends to operate the 8.0. side of 0.3.8. as an independent organisation parallel to 8.O.E. although perfectly willing to  co-ordinate on a higher level.  /, OOPY OF CIPHER TELEGRAM TO MOSCOW DATED 22.12.4S . 3235.   Balkans is undoubtedly the area in which Donovan's aesire   for an independent role is most dangerous. At present there   is integration in the field in Yugoslavia Albania and Greece   with Missions in each country containing British and American   personnel British largely predominating. Donovan wishes to   raise the American proportion of these .Missions to equality and   has obtained the right after discussion in Cairo with C.D. and   G-in-C. Middle East to increase representation With the Partisans   Greeks and Mihailovic to 15 each in principle if the operational   situation warrants. Ve hope this will satisfy him and you should   avoid giving him an opportunity to raise the subject again. On   the 8.1. side he has complete independence and subject to or even   without agreement by Tito Mihailovic and the Greek authorities   can establish his own 3.1. Missions. In Cairo there are separate   3.O.E. and 0.3.8. H.Q. but Donovan is perfectly willing to accept 3.O.E. as co-ordinating authority for these Balkan operat ional countries and m practice control of Missions in the Field is exercised by 8.O.E. 0.3.8. being closely consulted and informed. Working committees to work out details are constantly held. in Roumania and Bulgaria 0.3.3. operate independently both in the Field and at their H.Ci. at Istanbul but we are trying to arrange co-ordination in policy and believe 0.8.3. is willing to cooperate., CO Y Qg CIPHER TElEGRAI.1 TO IvlOdCOW DATED 22.12.4 .  No.  2S6  3. It is essential that 3.O.E./O.S.S./S.O. work in Yugoslavia Albania and ureece should be treated as that of a single organ isation operating under the direction of the appropriate military command. You should prevent Donovan therefore initiating discussions with the Russians in order to set up independent operations in these countries. All Directives on policy to be pursued in these countries are received by 3.0.E./0.S.3. from the military command and therefore any suggestions arising from discussions in Moscow would have to be referred back for final decision by Mediterranean H.Ci. D. From the above you will realise it is essential you keep us fully informed of developments and we will reply in detail on particular points as they arise., GOPY CIPHER TBUSGRAM PRCM MOSCOW DATED 28.12.45. HO. 1578.  CT. Pollov/ing lunch December 24th Donovan explained how  O.S.S. group mutilated Donovan. He proposed to tell the Russians of his readiness to exchange information and collaborate should the Soviet Government desire it on the same lines as he did with the British namely on a reciprocal basis.  H. He went into details of shipping of stores to Yugoslavia  which had been organised by 0.3.3. and how he expected service  would grow.  I. He agreed with the proposal to tell Colonel Haskell of our previous acquaintance and our talks in Moscow ifitich was done evening of December 24th. Haskell was non-committal as usual but endeavoured to show considerable knowledge of Donovan's history. J. Donovan accompanied by U.3.A. Ambassador had 45 minutes with Molotov on the evening of December 25th. The latter stated he would give their proposals his urgent attention. As Donovan expected to leave on the morning of December 26th Molotov promised to communicate through the U .3.A. Ambassador. K. Donovan is still weather bound here., COPY CIPHER TEIxBGRAM FROM MOSCOW DAT3D 2S.12.43. HO. 1577   B. At General Donovan's invitation Hill gave his frank opinion on what Donovan's preliminary moves should he in U.S.S.R. and discussed the instructions contained in your telegram 3234. G. General Donovan was open that there had teen genuine differ ences between him and S.O.E. but this had been thrashed out satisfactorily with C.D. in Cairo. To quote Donovan U.S.A. was no longer to be regarded on the level of a refugee government as it had been by soiae when participating in our spheres of common effort. Adequate representation of O.S.S. in Yugoslavia had been satisfactorily agreed in Cairo. Donovan stressed repeatedly the figure 15 mentioned in your telegram 3235. He seemed vague as to who the final authority was in this theatre of operations and made great play of the differences of opinion between Poreign Office influences and military opinion . D. Donovan expressed the view that U.S.S.R. was not being given anything like adequate representation by Great Britain and U.S.A. in the Balkans. He considered this stupid and dangerous and should be altered. E. Donovan referred rather bitterly to British reluctance in allowing 0 S1S . to use India as a spring board base and he talked at length on the latest O.S.Sh reorganization in China and said S.O.E. was fully informed of this. p. Conversation was repeated to U.S.A. Ambassador and he summed up by using some of our arguments., COPY CIPHER TELEGRAM FROM MOSCOV/ DATED 29.12.45. TO. 1380 A. Continuing our telegram 1378. Donovan still being weatherbound was unexpectedly invited on the evening of December 27th to visit the Chief of Soviet Intelligence at Loubianka. He took General Deane and aU.S.A. Embassy interpreter with him. B. Chief of Intelligence was a Lieutenant-General whose name I hope to get later an imposing man who spoke no English. Deane had not met him before. With the Lieutenant-General was the Chief of the Soviet Sabotage Organization Colonel Ossipov. C . The interview was very cordial and lasted over an hour. The Russians welcome the principle of collaboration with Donovan and asked him to send a representative to Moscow to study its possibilities. Donovan stated he wished to send Haskell if acceptable. It was explained that he was the son of Haskell who had been the head of American Red Cross relief organization in Russia in 1920/1921. Russians accepted Haskell jj . Haskell who had only been with Donovan for some 8 weeks is to return toU.S.A. have a short course and return to Moscow towards the end of February 1944 if possible via London. B. Donovan telephoned me after the meeting but as I was already engaged at the Chinese Embassy I decided to see him off at the aerodrome next morning. There he gave an account of his interview in the presence of U.S.A. Ambassador and Deane and was obviously very pleased with his visit., y. As the plane was cancelled at the last minute I took Donovan and Haskell sight-seeing on the outskirts of Moscow. During this trip Donovan talked freely and also shot two or three swift questions at Hill., FROM 6.1.1944 TO 3.7.1945, 13th February 1944.

This is a term that needs some explanation. In fact there is nothing really voluntary about it. Whatever is subscribed from the monthly salary comes about as a result of a special whip instruction rather on the lines of our Parliamentary system of special instructions from the party whip. No-one wants to subscribe to these loans but they do so for health reasons.  Lotteries. The lottery loans are the most popular because they are known to be very fairly conducted and there is a chance of getti ig a really good return for the voluntary subscription.  Savings Banks. There is a general lack of interest in savings campaigns and the majority of the population are averse to putting their money into this form of insurance. The chief reason for this attitude is suspicion that such money may not return to them at a future date. All their spare money the people use to buy goods of all kinds chiefly of a gymcrack nature such as cheap alarm clocks which may cost up to 100. Thoir main idea of course is Better the thing you can see than that which you cannot . There is also a great deal of selling of clothes but this is almost always in order to buy extra food.  PART F  SOCIAL CONDITIONS   1 This may seem to be rdther an odd heading for the parti cular section of this report but ordinary conditions are becoming a vury important factor in the Soviet Union.  2 There are four main classes among the population the governing class the military class the great body of technical experts in industry engineering mining railways and the still greater body of the population which exists in Russia. ./  i, 2   Russia today as specifically definite as any class in Great Britain U.S A. and Prance in the pre- .ar days. The military caste would seem to be making the biggest strides in Russia as a class. This particularly applies to the officers of the Red Army Navy and Air Force and to all commissioned officers of the N.K.D.V This class receives special privileges. At. the highest rate of exchange e.g. most favourable to British -that is 100 roubles to the officers of the Red Army receive on the average 20 more pay than tho corresponding rank of a British officer at 48 roubles to the of course it is doubled . In addition to this they have many more perquisites than any British officer could dream of. For instance all Russian officers receive three pairs of top boots free every two years a great coat every five years etc. etc. Their wives receive special consideration in that they are' enabled to travel at Government expense to join their husbands on new posts. They use the Red Army clubs as a matter of right and they are able to buy at tho military stores as against the civilian stores.   Such privileges aro also enjoyed by other groups of the population rather in keeping with tho special facilities afforded to various sections of the population as enumerated in Pfrt 0 of this report.    3 Crime. There is probably as much crime in U.S.S.R.. as anywhere else in the world. Just now owing to tho very stringent economic situation and shortage of food there is a great deal of petty crime theft breaking into empty premises and where there is bombing a certain amount of looting. Tho increase of crime is worrying the authorities in Russia They ar.e taking particular steps to bring it down. Sentences are very severe and from the standard of the West at times quite brutal.   Then there is social crime. Many people are being put away for some reason or other and they are not tried in the public courts. It Is sad to see groups of Russians going off to concentration camps under conditions that in some respects are worse than for those exiled to Siberia by the Tzaristsc   Men. and women sent into exile have a fatalistic look on their faces. That is understandable. They do not know when they will come back and to what conditions they will return. They know It will be a long time before they can communicate with their nearest and dearest.   The concentration camps they go to are in distant parts. There they work. There they are kept and maintained in good health and conditions-by the State for the reason that the State kmws they cannot got work out of people who are under nourished or live under conditions that will reduce their output. But tho individual suffering nevertheless is enormous.   This is a fact that has again got to bo-studied and appreciated by the foreign observer. It certainly does not   bring ../, -3   bring happiness to the individuals or the families who are left behind in the native cities and villages.   But it would be a mistake for the westerner to attach too much importance to this very unpleasant subject. Russia is fighting a total war. Before the total war she fought for that degree of unity which she seems to have found.    Conclusion of Part P To be continued., MEMORANDUM OF A TOUR MADE BY A BRITISH  OFFICER FROM MOSCOW TO LENINGRAD AND PARTS OF  THE LENINGRAD FRONT BE TWEEN  29 TH JANUARY AND 5TH FEBRUARY 1944   1 Preamble  a The tour was organised by the N.K.V.D. for one British officer who is bilingual in Russian and English and who has spent the/last two and a half years almost con tinuously in U.S.S.R.  b He was accompanied by an officer of the Soviet State Security Service and while in the Leningrad area was further joined by a partisan commander.  2 Map References O.S.

GERMAN  1 The following are the salient points of the intelligence gained during the visit part of which has been telegraphed in summary form from Moscow.  2  a Perlod Dawn 31st January to 2200 hours 3rd February.  b Weather lst/2nd February clear slight cloud some sun visibility good.  3 ... /, -2    3 Regions Visited 1st February By car Leningrad -Peterhof -Oranienbaum - Ropsha -Gatchina -Tsarskoie Selc -Leningrad.   2nd February By car along the main road to Kingisepp branch ing off some miles from the town taking first north-westerly direction followed by a sharp north-easterly angle to some deep reserve artillery lines    4 I was only able on the second day to get an occasional glimpse of the conducting officers' small scale map which made accurate plotting of our positions on this day diffi cult. This was one of the few instances during the tour when I was conscious that information was being deliberately withheld.    5 The German Army Zone The Germans got to within 5 kilometres of the Leningrad suburbs and to within 4 -kilometres of parts of the Kirov  Putilov Works.       6 Viewed from the late German front line the city they wished for stands out in a most attractive silhouette. In two and a half years the Germans built five separate lines of defence going back in the third line as far as Strelnia. Each line consisted of large independent and not very deep  6 -10 ft. blockhouses each of which was designed to have an all-round field of fire.  V These blockhouses were connected by a series of shallow  3-4 ft. ersnehes irregular but not traversed mostly lined with corrugated sheets supported as a rule bj-iron staves. No parapet of any kind other than the earth ori ginally excavated seems to have been attempted. In my whole tour I did not see a single sandbag. Some of the blockhouses and in particular those in the third and fourth lines were connected by concrete tunnels those seen were no deeper than the blockhouses themselves. N.B. The Russian system of defence seems to have been almost iden tical with the above except that the communication ways were lined by wood and propped by wooden staves. In this front zone both sides have made full use of any house not demolished as forts. Barbed wire did not appear to have been extensively used by either side.    8 On the road from Leningrad to Peterhof all bridges had been demolished the entire region shows signs of heavy artillery mortar and machine gun fire. But surprisingly little evidence of aerial bombing was to be seen.  9 The read between Leningrad and Peterhof This road was littered with German and Russian tanks some in original combat positions others brought up by the salvage corps from the place of engagement. This made it difficult to appraise the true situation. Many wrecked   . cars and lorries in evidence -nearly all German. Here too were to be seen scores of wrecked trams of the Leningrad- Strelnia line. They are shell-riddled skeletons but by their various positions clearly indicate that they had been used two and a half years ago up to the last minute by the Russians for evacuation purposes.    10 German Anti-Tank Devices Concrete mostly pyramid-shape some trenching deep protected .., -3   protected by pill-boxes a few thick walled barricades well   placed. These were invariably pierced by drainpiping suita   ble for use of snipers and small anti-tank guns with a few   good concrete machine gun fire positions..    11 Artillery At the position examined by me at Petertiof out of 28 guns 12 of which were directed over the wate. to Kronstadt the muzzles of 20 were effectively destroyed and breach blocks taken out. Five other guns were superficially damaged. Presumably the Germans had relied on blowing up the timber fort protecting them for breaches and even sights were not damaged. Ho attempt had been made to render three guns in any way useless. Shells and charges had been left undamaged in underground shelters in large quantities.   At every artillery post not only at Peterhof but at all other German battery positions visited in addition to the ordinary alarm device generally a cartridge case with a spanner attached by a cord there were special separate gas alarm devices. Some of these were of the rattle type some consisted of small Russian church bells. Every device had most specific instructions as to when and how it should be sounded.    12 Between Peterhof and Ropsha in the thick woods there were a large number of Howitzer batteries of varying calibres. All those seen v/ere excellently protected by large timbered emplacements all of y/hi ch were excellently camouflaged as were the approaches to them and the officers' men's reserve and hospital quarters. There were many signs of battery positions being abandoned owing to direct hits or damage. According to my partisan guide except for one sector where seven out of eleven Howitzers were left completely intact  I saw three of these most of the guns had been effectively destroyed by the Germans before abandoning the positions.  15 Effect of German Bombardment of Leningrad This will be dealt with in detail under Part B. It is however a- opriate here to note for these were some of the batteries which ranged on the Kirov Putilov Works what their fire was like.   At the Kirov Works for instance most careful statistics were kept on the results of enemy shelling. Looking through the vast data collected by the works of every shell that had fallen in and about the premises I memorised the following details not being able to make notes   18th March 1943 -313 hits 43 unexploded . 2 killed 18 wounded. 2nd June 1943 -247 hits 31 unexploded 6 killed 38 wounded shrapnel was used .   8th September 1943 -224 hits 54 unexploded 13 killed 67 wounded there was a direct hit on a dug-out.   The last artillery fire suffered by the factory was on December 16th. The last shell to fall on Leningrad was on 21st January 1944.    14 The Kirov Works closed during the latter part of December 1941 re-opened in March 1942 and has supplied the frsnt ever since.  15 ... /, -4    15 German Mine Defences  a Enormous quantities of flat type mine sown everywhere particularly in fields suitable for tanks and on all wood paths and clearings. Booby traps were everywhere. In addition deep delayed action mines were planted freely and skillfully. Aerial bombs had been used as a sub stitute by the Russians.  b Plat mines are systematically collected by the Russians. I watched two separate groups of Russian trained Alsation dog teams at work on mine detection. This was fas cinating the dogs work purely by scent. A keeper  trainer and two soldiers are attached to each dog. When the dog detects a mine it crouches above it until the keeper comes up. Such a mine is dealt with by one of the soldiers while the keeper directs the dog to its next target. The O.C. of these two groups states that this method of detection gives excellent results and is quieter and more certain than any other method yet devised.   c In place after place the Germans standing Danger -mines or Mined . This is pro bably not as serious as it seems for few Russians know Latin characters let alone German script. Alongside German notices there new appear warnings in Russian.  16 German Air Activities I saw no enemy aircraft over districts visited on 1st February only two German fighters were sighted during the whole day of 2nd February.    17 German Tanks On 2nd February I saw about sixteen burnt out tanks off roads two of these were Tigers. On main Kingisepp road I saw one burnt out and badly damaged tank put out of action by anti-tank gunfire.    18 German Transport Throughout the two days saw comparatively few destroyed lorries etc. other than those including heavy and infan try caterpillar lorries ditched and abandoned without damage on roads. However I encountered south of Gatchina a M.T. transport depot undamaged including eight or ten mobile workshops completely Intact.    19 Horse Transport It is reported that this was used very extensively by the Germans and there is much evidence seen to confirm this. At a repair and maintenance centre near Gatchina I saw some 200 250 German Army carts about 70 of which were brand new.    2Â° Field w/T   Two intact German mobile field W/T stations were seen at Tsarskoie Selo believed to be one unit. This was one of the few closely guarded trophies observed throughout the trip.    21 German Camouflage  a Profuse and effective -some of the paint at Gatchina still new. Locals state that early in December 1943 many of the places not previously camouflaged were treated., -5    b Leningrad-Tsarskoie Selo road for many kilometres the exposed road was screened from the Russians by fish nets suspended from poles some 10 ft. high. Nets are lightly decorated with leaves and straw. The screen shows signs of having been in place a long time.  22 Identifications Only marks consistently seen were an elephant sometimes two very occasionally three elephants. These appeared on captured guns directional signs and stencilled on some vil lage houses.    23 Enemy Dead On a sector of about 4 kilometres I saw some 700 to 1 000 steel helmets mostly undamaged. Explanation was that a battalion had been caught by Katushas . Clearing up parties collect bodies but owing to their weight leave the helmets which are collected by other groups.   At Gatchina I saw a common grave with excavator standing by with about 200 German dead in uniform without caps. On 1st February I saw about 2 000 German graves all carefully labelled and the Russians intend to respect them. They are burying their own dead individually where possible.   There were German signs and signposts everywhere many new. Papers food etc. were left behind in large quantities. I picked up a Christmas postcard dated 12th December 1943 from Dresden bearing field post stamp of 31st December this on 1st February .    24 German Prisoners Saw about 140 In two groups marching towards Oranianbaum under a very light guard.    25 German Morale Russians state that Germans have fought most stubbornly and well wherever they have been ordered to make a stand. But once away from positions or taken on a flank they incline to panie.    26 German Material The Recorder of Artillery Museum Leningrad who is making a special study of everything captured on this front stated that in the last few weeks the Germans have used a new type of lemon grenade. This is larger than the old type and very effective. I could obtain no further details. The recor der added he considers all German clothing has greatly and steadily deteriorated. Technical clothing for scouts sni pers etc. and camouflage has improved in design during the summer and autumri of 1943. Telescopic sights on rifles were as good as ever.   At the Artillery Museum I also saw a 4 six-barrelled gas shell thrower and was told that a 4 ' ten-barrelled thrower had been captured in recent operations.    27 Satellite States At the Artillery Museum I saw caps identification papers pay-books and special arm-bands of Spanish Blue Divi sion French volunteers Dutch Norwegian Danish and I could get no information about any of these except that the   last ... / /i, -6   last Spaniard had been captured early in November on the   Leningrad front. The recorder became very reticent when   questioned.    28 German Propaganda Leaflets dropped over Russian army on this front and over Leningrad seem fairly good. The best are clever cartoons against Stalin and other Soviet leaders and a particular set are directed against collective farming. The most bitter cartoons of the lot were those launched against the local Leningrad officials. For some reason a large number of wellwritten leaflets in German were dropped on Leningrad on two occasions during the last part of December. It is thought that they were meant for a later period for such towns as Riga.   II. RUSSIAN  29 In the Zone of Operations Touring the still mined areas so recently occupied by the Germans one was struck by the enormous effort being made by the Russians to clear up the battle-fields to re-lay noads and repair bridges.   In the two days tour I did not see a single bridge  however small that had not been destroyed by the retreating Army.   Russian sappers were feverishly rebuilding these in a temporary manner. Small road bridges were relaid wholly larger ones are to take single traffic only. All repairs effected by timber -most of which is failed at the nearest convenient wood and trimmed on the spot. The rate of repair appeared to be extremely rapid. Male and female soldiers were engaged on this work. Road repairs are mostly being done by women soldiers In charge of male engineers.    30 Road ContrnT  a In the deep rear control was excellent. Roads at all crossings and long stretches were patrolled mostly by women soldiers armed with Tommy Guns. They carry sig nal flags and flash lamps -the control Is maintained by day and night. At important bridges male sentries are on duty. At main approaches to villages there are control .posts -documents are examined. Village streets are strictly patrolled soldiers' and civilians' iden tity cards are constantly being checked.  b In the sone of the front there seems to be practically no traffic or military police control. From personal obser vation I conclude that there is a belt of from 15 to 25 kilometres in the rear of the Russian line that is neglected .in this extraordinary and unaccountable way. The writer travelled back to U.K. with a Senior British Naval Officer who had been stationed in the Black Sea and who was allowed to visit the forward Russian positions at Novorossisk some time ago. We compared notes and his observatj ons on road control a and b above were identical with my own.  31 Russian Infantry  a As a result of careful observation I estimate that in the Leningrad ... /, -7   Leningrad area fifty-five per cent of the infantry were armed with Tommy-guns and automatic rifles 'a fur ther twenty percent with semi-automatic rifles. The remainder are equipped with an old pattern rifle and bayonet. Pew of the infantry detachments seen on the march carried helmets or gas masks. I was told these went with the baggage.    b Age -infantry had a high percentage of yoang men 16 to 17 years old. These were small of stature had no stubble on their faces and looked like growing apprentices though they seemed cheerful enough.  32 Russian F.G. Companies Heavy These would seem to number about 50 men to four machine guns. Companies drag guns and ammunition on sledges reserve ammunition food etc. were brought up by horse trans port kept well to the rear.   The road distances between companies on the march seems dangerously small. It would appear from formations seen by me on the road that it is the practice for nearly all the officers of a detachment to march in a band at the head of the column with their ski company all armed with Tommy or automatic rifles immediately preceding them.    33 Russian Snipers At a field hospital In Gatchina I interviewed a severely wounded sniper. By his bedside he had his telescopic sighted rifle it was a short pattern Russian infantry rifle with adjustable telescopic sight firing standard ammunition The rifle bore a silver plaque on this the sniper's name was inscribed and stated that he had accounted for 200 of the enemy. The sniper with great pride showed me his log-book which credited him with a further 36 hits. He bemoaned that he had not managed to reach a total of 250. He had been a sniper for eighteen months and had attended a sniper school. He worked with a mate who acted as a spotter. The spotter was not a marksman but expert at using field glasses. The spotter had been killed when the sniper had been wounded. Beside the . fie there was a mounting for rifle this was made of light aluminium tubing its circular base was about 18-20 inches in diameter with 3 tubular supports 18 inches high with a jointed adjustable swivllled clamp to take rifle immediately in front of magazine. The sniper stated that this mounting was light and very useful. Much fuss was being made of the sniper by the nursing staff. His rifle and mounting were greatly admired and were to go with him to the base.    34 Russian Tanks  a Soon after turning off the main road to Kingisepp 2nd February I met a tank formation in a village which was returning to the front after having been refitted and manned. The formation consisted of two large tanks and nine smaller ones all apparently the same pattern and was commanded by a lieutenant-colonel a Latvian. He kept me well away from the tanks. He spoke with enthu siasm of his men. He had not operated with Allied tanks himself but had heard them well-spoken of by fellow officers. He mentioned in conversation that his medium tanks required 76 m.m. thickness of ice for operating and bemoaned the mild winter.  b On 1st February our car was held up at a partly rebuilt bridge .. . /, -3   bridge on the road 5 kms. north of Gatchina by salvage   operations on two Russian tanks. These were proceeding to attack Gatchina had tried to ford the stream and had   foundered. Occupants of both tanks were drowned.   The officer in charge of salvage was a tank corps major. While obstruction on the road was being cleared we chatted he stated that it was obvious that while the tank commander had tested the depth of the water he had not allowed for the soft sand bed of the stream.  Poor chaps -good spirit but not enough experience was the comment.   He was most anxious for us to see the first tank come up and the bodies taken out. I was glad time did not permit this itxxx xxxxxiXxxxSxikixkxxxxxkxiixxiexxkx.   He stated in conversation that he did not like    35 Russian Transport the British Mathilda Tanks.  a Road M.T. Throughout areas visited American built lorries were very much in evidence. Personnel of these when i questioned stated that they like them and that they stand up well to winter and Russian road conditions.   Russian built lorries are smaller but likewise popular. To every petrol lorry there were about two wood-burning gas propelled lorries. These are most popu lar and as long as there are forests there is no question of fuel shortage. Each lorry carries small emergency petrol supply. Nearly all lorries are camouflaged in white for the winter. Generally speaking good road formation was being maintained though the distance betv/ een lorries seemed dangerously close.    b Horse. Transport Very much in evidence. Large trains with stores and fodder proceeding towards front in what would appear to be dangerously close formation were to be seen. Sledges were drawn by single horse for the most part there was about one unharnessed reserve Korse for every nine sledges. The horses looked well fed and cared for.    c Railway Military Transport I did not visit any railheads. At Tsarskoie Selo I talked to a lieutenant-colonel in charge of reconstruc tion of the Leningrad-Tsarskoie line. The work of clear ing and remaking the permanent way scientifically des troyed by the Germans laying sjbeepers and lines was proceeding at a great pace. In addition to male and female soldiers many civilian women were aiding the engineers. The lieutenant-colonel stated that 278 kms. of line had been reconditioned in twenty days. He did not specify the area. He spoke bitterly about unneces sary destruction of Tsarskoie station -which has been razed to the ground. He stated that Leningrad-Tsarskoie was the first railway to be built in Russia. Tsarskoie station was renowned and loved by all Russian railway personnel. Soviet artillery had in retreat and attack spared it only to have it destroyed by the Hun in retreat. His words uttered in sight of the demolished station and railway yards carried conviction and made a deep impres sion as to the sincerity of his views.    d, -9    d Railways -General  i Into and around Leningrad passes over single badly laid lines but there is no chaos. The run from Moscow to Leningrad or vice versa up to 3rd February was scheduled to take 38 hours. The train out of Moscow on 29th January left on time for Leningrad and arrived to the minute. From 3rd February the time for the tun was cut by 3 hours i.e. 34 hours . Train left Leninggrad on time and arrived -in Moscow under thirty minutes late for its first run.   New Single Line on Route taken Map reference Russia 1 I 000 000 36 W. runs   MOSCOW -B0L0G0E -thence to   LUBITINO - approx. 58Â° 45W. 33Â° 30'E. through   NEBOLCHI - l' 59Â° 20 'N. 33Â° 25 'E. to   TIKHVIN 59Â° 40'N. 33Â° 30'E. thence to   VOLKHOV LENINGRAD.   For the most part the track of this'line is very bad clearly a make-shift with some stiff gradients. However the loop sidings are numerous and exceptionally long and bridges are good.   These are all guarded.   The line runs through thickly forested country its defences are most interesting. The trees in the forst adjacent to the line -only on the enemy's approach -are felled with a view to getting a good field of fire. In such clearings there are lumber blockhouses planted to afford maximum cover. In all clearings many of the largest pines have been blown up in a manner to ensure    hat their roots give a natural cover and here   concrete pill-boxes are invariably planted.   On the edges of forest clearings I noticed well camouflaged observation posts in the tree-tops.    ii The old direct line - It was hoped 3rd February that this service would be operating from 15th February. The schedule run was planned to take twenty hours.   Returning to Moscow on 5th February I noticed in passing through the Moscow yards the special blue coaches of the ''Red Arrow traip. with white lettering inscribed in Russian and English being washed down and prepared. I am confident the lihe will be operating as planned on 15th February.    iii Moscow-Archangel Line Time 38 hours running this winter remarkably to time. Moscow-Kuiblshev likewise.    iv /, -10    iv Vladlvostock-Moscow This is subject to usual winter delays. But average time for letters from Sverdlovsk to Lenin grad allowing for censoring takes ten days.    v Ladoga Trassa Ladoga-Leningrad Arterial Road . The two parallel arterial roads built in November 1941 and January 1942 which kept Leningrad and the Leningrad front alive throughout the blockade will be dealt with later.    vi The Abdication Railway coaches of Nicholas II These as museum pieces have stood for many years on a special siding outside Peterhof. Their shells on the bogies still stand on the siding. Their interiors have been looted to the last screw. Their armoured sides are scarred by bullet and shrapnel their roofs damaged by high explosive.   It is curious that the Germans did not send these two historic relics to Germany when they could in order to add them to the other historic railway carriage in their possession.    36 Russian Army Morale  a Excellent -in Leningrad and in the field saluting is most punctillious. All troops seen appeared to be keen very much alive. I consider this is due to two reasons  i Natural keenness -the hunting instinct with its craft cunning and cruelty so inherent in the ave rage Russian character is enjoying the job of kil ling and driving out the German savage.  ii Postered keenness -in every re-conquered village and hamlet there was a liberal display of telling Soviet propaganda posters really excellent staff work . Likewise not only the latest editions of the Leningrad Pravda but also the Moscow Izvestia Pravda Red Star and Red Fleet are posted up in th P streets for all and sundry to read. Note On 1st and 2nd February our party left Leningrad before the Pravda had come outj on the evening of each of these days my Russian companions stopped to read the day's news on the wall . The news is also disseminated by radio -Peter hof was rewired for general loud-speaker wireless broadcast on the morning of 1st February i.e. eight days after the German evacuation. The same effort was being made to connect up the controlled Soviet wireless in villages visited on 2nd February.    37 Russian Navy  a I made no contacts of importance nor did I see any naval craft in the waters between Leningrad and Kronstadt.  b Identifi cations -Nje.va 31st January -3rd February  i Ice-breaker ERMAK at the quay by the Hermitage. Camouflaged and manned. She did not appear ready to /, -11   to put to sea at short notice she is said periodically to go out into the. Gulf.    ii Asmaller details as before but she was moored closer to the Exchange.  iii By the Exchange and silhouette rather like the Russian ship that attended the Coronation review off Spithead.  iv One cruiser but she did not appear to be manned.  v One small information.  vi Alongside with no signs of life.  vii Out at the painted hulls which looked like cruisers. Work was proceeding on rne of them. I also saw some thing that looked like a newly painted submarine but the distance was too great to see for certainty.  viii In 1941 the Kirov works were doing no shipbuilding but specialised in turbines for ships.  ix Opposite modern undamaged turbine merchant ship. It was giving.off auxiliary steam and showed other signs of life. There were sentries on the gang ways and the ships looked smart and clean.  x Sailors working about 30 of them on a special course at the Kirov rolling plant.  xi Sailors Isaac's Square along the quays and on the Field of Mars.  38 Russian Air Force  a No units visited by me though five aerodromes were passed. In each case visibility was only from the road and there fore bad. All these aerodromes had been used by the Ger mans and the hangars were burnt out. Each was well guarded and very well protected by Russian A.A. batteries. Some of these were heavy ones but the predominating ones wore of a light calibre. All approaches to aerodromes were well covered by manned M.G. posts.  b On Tsarskoie Selo aerodrome some twenty fighters and a few Stormovik type machines were seen. Note The active aerodromes which I saw were at Oranienbaum Strelnia and Gatchina.  39 Russian Air Activity -1st.and 2nd February.  a Fighter activity was slight but continuous. On the even ing of 2nd February I saw 6 bombers going out in for mation rather poor with fighter protection. On the 'second day fighter planes were much more in evidence fly ing in formation of five or seven machines.   At Peterhof during a stay of three and a half hours there   was ... /, -12   was constant Soviet air patrol ovor the water between   Peterhof Leningrad Kronstadt and beyond. Note   I viewed Kronstadt from an excellent ex-German O.P. through Zeiss glasses that had been abandoned.    b My contact a captain 3rd-class major by name Ivan I. Koleanskov who was travelling from Leningrad to a new post on the mid-Leningrad front expressed his enormous admiration for British formation flying as demonstrated by 152 Wing. This was a craftsman's tribute. On politics and the Second Front later he was less compli mentary see below . His was one of the few names of Russians I was able to record as he wished me to convey a message to one of his Soviet air colleagues now in London.  c Homage to Fallen Soviet Air personnel Outstanding air personnel who fell on the Leningrad front are being burled In the grounds of the late Alexander Nevski Monastery within the shadow of Suvorov's tomb .    40 Field Casualty Clearing Hospitaj. at Gatchina  a This was housed in I.P. double lined type of tent. Heating was by wood burning stoves bark mats over large tarpaulins-on the floor. It had about 100 beds tent/ and an operating/ there were men and women doctors and surgeons mostly women. The orderlies were all women. Clean and rough the hospital looked efficient. The food was simple but good and plentiful. There was a special blood transfusion ward see Scrapbook . There were male sentxSes on the gates.    b Field Ambulances These vehicles no horse drawn seen carry only a small red cross sign which is illuminated at night over the driver's seat. This is for Russian road control only. No red crosses are painted on sides of ambulances or marked on the roof.    What would be the use of our marking our ambulances specially asked the officer in charge of M.T. The Germans would concentrate fire on such markings.    41 Red Cross Train Consisted of 10 24-stretcher-bed waggons 1 24-sleeping coach for senior personnel 1 operating theatre Ist-class converted   18 converted goods trucks for stretcherbearers bath stores   4 long open platforms which carry 4 small motor ambulances one saloon car one small lorry.   The train was spotlessly clean and on its way to the front after a quick turn-round at Nebolchi where there is a general casualty clearing station . It was proceeding to Okulovka in the first instance. The only indication that this was a Red Cross train was the presence of small stencilled red crosses on the sides of the carriages. The roofs had no red crosses on them. It was coupled to an armoured engine very makeshift armour .    42 ... / r', -13    42 Parti sans  a Tribute after tribute has been paid to partisan activity in the Press during the recent operations on the Leningrad Front.  b I interviewed 2 badly wounded partisans in a C.C S. I also met 6 who had just come through the lines also a party of Lettish partisans who were awaiting transport.  c I obtained little new information from these contacts but a great deal of confirmation as to the correctnejss of my telegram of 15th December last. In reference for example to my paragraph D l bands on the Leningrad Front were organised in groups of 100 but in Battalions and they were not styled as Brigades.  d My special conducting officer throughout the time of my arrival in Leningrad and departure was a reserve captain. He had organised and commanded four battalions of Partisans on the Leningrad Front operating between Pskov Narva and Leningrad until last October. By profession an electrical engineer of standing in 1941 at the Baltic Works he collected a band of volunteers when It was evident that Leningrad would be blockaded.  See Scrapbook .    43 Russian Officers More and more officers of all services are now wearing ribbons instead of as hitherto astual decorations except for medals worn on the right breast e.g. for the Defence of Stalingrad Odessa Sevastopol and Leningrad. These are only given for real service of defence and are very greatly esteemed.    44 Conclusion to Military Section I think a conversation I had with a shunter at Tikhvin Station which had been occupied by the Germans will best illustrate the general attitude of the Russian military and civilian mind   Writer  When did the Germans leave here   Shunter  What   Writer  When did the Germans leave here   Shunter  looking at me with bewilderment and partial con tempt Leave here The German did not leave here he was driven from here.    Conclusion of PART A. To be continued ., '2 'FEB1944   AAA 13th February 1944.   Memorandum of a. Tour made by a Brl tlah   Officer from Moscow to Leningrad-and parts of the Leningrad Front between 29th January and 5th February 1944   Addenda to Part A    1 Battlefields  a On 2nd February In Kingisepp area I saw more knocked out Russian tanks and lorries than German ones. The dead seen in the fields were mostly Russian. Where Germans had made a stand on the roads or around disabled tanks there were a small number of dead Germans. Accurate observation was made more difficult by a light fall of snow on the night of lst/2nd February.  o The most battle-scarred area seen throughout the trip as far as terrain was concerned -was that west and south west of Oranienbaum.  2 German Field Telegraph and Telephone Communications  a From front and secondary positions to the rear there seemed to be two to three separate lines. Each line had a different coloured outer covering e.g. black grey and orange  sometimes deep red . All lines were well insulated. From the third line of defence to the rear lines of these colours were doubled and trebled with'well insulated silver or white wires.  b Russians have kept these lines intact but about every two kilometres they cut a gap In the lines of about 70 yards. Each cut end is however carefully linked tc the other end by cord.  3 Special Car Pass in area of Operations It is of interest to note that during the tour of Lenin grad frontal areas lst/2nd February our car travelled through out with a large yellow 6 by 4' notice slashed with a St. Andrew s Cross one arm being red the other green. Only once during the two days were we stopped by a patrol this patrol was very curtly asked by the senior guide why he did not know the sign and why the car bearing it had been stopped. During the tour I only saw two other cars bearing our pass. Both cars were of the large Z.I.Z. limousine type but unfor tunately empty so I had no opportunity of judging the class of occupant. '   PART B   LENINGRAD AND LENINGRAD AREA   Period 31st January to 3rd February 1944.    1 Leningrad  a The City Despite 2- -years of siege intensive devastating bombing and bombardment the sky-line of Leningrad with its fine historic domes and spires .looks little different from what it did in 1914.   Yet .../, -2-   Yet 90/c of the city's buildings are scarred. Some 56/ are roofless and uninhabitable the remaining 34/& are  patched up for habitation.   Looking down the long broad streets and prospects the extent of real damage to the city is not at first very apparent. There are gaps where houses and buildings have been completely demolished but one gets a general impression that one is viewing undamaged buildings. The reason is simple Leningrad in the main was built before iron girders and reinforced concrete were generally used in construction. Therefore while buildings' interiors have been guttecP ' the walls have remained standing unbroken.   Every corner house and many others throughout the city have been adequately converted for street defence purposes. At all possible positions field gun emplace ments have also been made with concrete.   All this work I was given to understand was done by individual house committees who worked on the construc tion from blue prints and they found the labour. Pew of these defences were finally condemned by the inspecting fortification engineers. Anti-tank traps and harriers d erected in the main streets were however built by the army   Other than the influenza of 1942 there were no serious outbreaks of epidemics in the city or district.   As in London the main bridges of Leningrad were not seriously damaged by bombing or bombardment. Seme of the important buildings have hardly been damaged by enemy fire for instance St. Isaac's Cathedral now the Godless Museum three hits the Kazan Cathedral two hits St. Peter & St. Paul's Cathedral the Admiralty Spire etc. undamaged But even where buildings have not suffered from hits hardly a single window remains intact owing to the effects of blast. There was little material to replace the shattered glass and so the frost of the severe winter of 1941/42 caused dreadful havoc. This is particularly noticeable in historic buildings where the   magnificent parquet floors and ceilings have been damaged beyond repair.    b Reason why the Damage was not greater Leningrad-ites claim that this is due to the excellenbe of Russian artillery counter-battery work. This after the first few-weeks of the siege when the Germans wished to take the city intact dominated the German fire.    c Suffering of the Population During the siege the population suffered most from    i Starvation  ii Cold and lack  iii Result ef enemy  iv Shortage of  d Effect of Starvation Males especially labourers succumbed quicker than females death from starvation between men and women said to have been in a ration of three to one.   Childran nearly all above the age of five were evacuated in 1941 that remained in Leningrad were specially   fed ... /, -3   fed and housed and the mortality among them and among those born during the siege was relatively low.    e Leningrad in February 1944 It is the cleanest and best cared for city I have visited throughout the length and breadth of U.S.S.R since my arrival in the autumn of 1941.   Its peace-time 1941 population of over 3 500 000 has been reduced to one of a little over 1 000 000. In consequence the city naturally looks a little empty trams are not crowded but the queues in front of kiosks waiting to buy newspapers seem as long as any seen in other parts of the U.S.S.R.   From 27th January -the last German shells fell on Leningrad on 21st January -the main tram services recom menced to function. At present there is insufficient power to un trolley buses. Hundreds of these are to be seen in various st.reets where they stopped on their last run in 1941. These are all jacked up and properly pro tected against weather. Many of them are damaged by shell fire but as soon as there is sufficient power those still able to function will be on the road again.    f Public Services Electric light services have been partly restored water mains to a lesser degree there is no gas and no main power heating. The automatic and manual telephone systems worked ' more or less throughout the siege and the service is improving daily. The broadcasting servi ce in streets and to subscribers was maintained throughout the siege and facilities for this are being daily increased.    g Public Morale  i On the mdrning of 1st February when we drove through the Moscow Region of Leningrad on our way to the front the anti-tank defences deep reinforced barriers ditches and other obstructions were all in place -as they were on our return at eventide. Yet on the following morning at 8.45 a.m. on leaving by the same route all obstacles had been removed ditches filled in etc. On 3rd February whilst talking to the Deputy Commissar of the Region I mentioned my surprise at the speed at which in the hours of darkness this clearance had been achieved he told me that the public had clamoured for the removal of barriers to such an extent that he had telephoned to the Pre sident of Leningrad Soviet about the demand. The ultimate reply from the Leningrad Soviet was that while there was no objection to the removal of the defences the authorities were quite unable to supply man-power or transport to effect this the matter would have to wait. In view of this the local population voluntarily decided to remove all obstructions in their spare time. They did so on the night of lst/2nd February dumping all material in the nearby demolished areas.    ii Leningrad-ites have been highly amused to see two large German undamaged self-propelled guns of high calibre hauling a long line of heavily laden sledges through the streets of the city. The ... /, -4-   The two guns were captured intact by specially trained assault crews who drove them safely back to the Russian lines. N.B. There is a school at Leningrad-which specialises in trainihg officers and men for this type of work. They train on captured enemy vehicles.   In Leningrad these two guns are as popular as performing elephants. It was feared I should not see them but one was having its day off -i.e. its driver was so I was taken to admire it in its yard.   I asked the major in charge of transport if these guns used up a great deal of petrol. Yes he replied but it's worth it for the population love them and are cheered to see them hauling loads    iii In November 1943 by a unanimous decision of the Leningrad Town Soviet it was resolved that the names of certain historic places in Leningrad should revert to their old Imperial designations. For instance Vorovsky Square is oneeagain to be known as Saint Isaac s Square the October Prospect as the Nevsky Prospect etc. etc. heroes of the Bolshevik Revolution and the U.S.S.R. such as Vorovsky Uritsky etc. are to be given places of honour and remembered by new areas of post-war Leningrad being named after them.  g The Hermitage and the Winter Palace The assistant curator -a very intelligent woman of peasant parentage -who took me over the two great build ings linked by the numerous underground passages and covered bridges across the canal that separates them started the tour by saying You are going to see empty damaged rooms from which for the third time in twentyfour years all treasure has been evacuated 1917 on the approach of the Germans 1920 on approach of the White Russians and 1941 again on the approach of the Germans  .We do not believe it will be evacuated again anyway not in this century .   99.5% of all the treasures were evacuated. Only th empty picture frames and showcases indicate what the rooms once contained. Among articles left were a few great stone or marble vases some great bronze candelabra and some unimportant furnitur . Also one or two mosaics which would have been ruined had they peen moved. Hardly a window pane remains intact eighty tons of glass was swept up after the first big bombardment. The three-ply wood that was nailed over the windows has been blown in over and over again. The buildings have not been heated since 1941. They are ice caverns in winter damp in summer the magnificent floors are ruined beyond repair many of the ceilings are down. . Direct hits have done a fair amount of damage but both buildings can and will be restored.   The curator stated that as soon as Leningrad was threatened painters artists writers hundreds of students school children sailors off duty and towns people of every kind volunteered as packers checkers and for heavy labour.   Not a case has been lost or damaged there is at   present a small exhibition of some of the less important   Hermitage trassures at Omsk and another at Sverdlovsk.   Wherever ... /, -5-   Wherevar I visited I did my bast to give 'each specialist .an idea of what was correspondingly happening in U.K i'his invariably aroused great interest and many questions.   I told the curator of how the National Gallery had been evacuated of the concerts held in the lunch hour and of the exhibition of one great picture every week. The curator thought the latter a wonderful idea she referred to it over and over again - We must do something like that she said We may even be able to open one room for it will be long before the general repairs can be done.    In 1921 we worked day and night to get the Hermitage re-opened. It was essential that the people should know that their treasures had not been lost or misused. The opening of the Hermitage helped we believe to build con fidence in the stability of the soviet Government.    h . The Smolny Institute This was Lenin's headquarters on the eve of seizing power and subsequently the seat of the Leningrad Town.and Regional Soviet. This huge building was too badly damaged to make it worth inspecting. At my request we drove past it for I wanted to refresh my memory of its position.    i Peter the Great's House The little wooden house on the island where Peter the Great lived while his city was being built has been com pletely covered over with concrete and reinforced in such a way as to make its destruction by bomb or direct hit almost impossible.    j The Kirov Putilov Works  i The Kirov works are being dealt with here and not under paragraph c of this report because they play such an integral part in the life of Lenin grad -an even greater part than when the Kirov works were known as the Putilov works a hotbed of revolution in the days of St. Petersburg.  ii Its organisation of other large Soviet industries.  iii In 1941  about 63 male and 37 female . In February 1944 there were 3 500 workers employed in two ten-hour shifts 21 male and 79% female .  iv In October and three-quarters of the work people were evacuated to Sverdlovsk. A further 10% of the machinery was packed up for evacuation but did not get away.in time and most of this is still to'be seen in various parts of the works.  v With a production until the end of December 1941 when the Germans established their front line to within 5-g-kilometres of the main works.  vi Production  vii On re-opening a state of devastation as they now are . However  with the Germans still only kilometres away ten ... /,  viii  ix  x  xi  xii -6   ten workshops skillfully dispersed and camou flaged were reclaimed and resumed production They carried on uninterrupted until the siege was lifted in January 1944. Between March 1942 and the end of the siege about 1 000 workers were killed or died of starvation.   For the planned 1944 Leningrad offensive it was necessary to start the steel rolling mills in order to supply essential munitions. On 16th November 1942 these came into action and have continued production without interruption. For the making of this steel local sand had to be used and although this was not very suitable fair results were obtained by experiment   I was shown round by the Director of the Kirov   works for history and personality see Scrapbook . At first sight everything seemed in ruins then one picked out active workshops some small some large. As one walked through the yards in every possible place wrecked workshops were being reconditioned in a makeshift manner. Two days previous to my visit 800 extra hands had been taken on for this work alone. At every turn throughout the works one saw evidence of the Russians' genius for improvisation.   At each workshop I was introduced to its manager. The Director and managers all wore a smart cloth cap long leather double-breasted coats gloves felt top-boots with leather soles and uppers. Their relationship with foremen and workmen seemed to be excellent. I saw aerial bombs cast fitted and assembled ready for filling handgrenades. heavy mortar shells and light artillery shells being manufactured as well as certain aircraft parts. I was told that shipbuilding had been discontinued in the 1930s. and in its place ships' turbines had been extensively manu factured. At each workshop the managers explained what was being done answered my ques tions very frankly and asked about conditions in England. After chatting to them I was then encouraged to talk to the foremen and work people many of the 'foremen' were women.   In three or four workshops I was introduced to old workmen and old revolutionaries -those who in the days of their youth had been agitators at Putilov Works and had also been to prison for their pains these were interesting as individuals see Scrppbook .   At the entrance to most workshops there was a dis play of slogans and a bust of Lenin Stalin or Kirov a board for the wall newspaper and another for announcements of various committee meetings lectures concerts or similar social events. There were three or four wireless loud-speakers in every workshop. There were also freely dis played first-aid hints anti-gas precautions and instructions for dealing with incdndiary bombs.   In each workshop in a quiet but prominent spot out of the bustle there is a small railed off space decorated with red bunting or Soviet flags. Here the names of all the 'Stahanov1' workers are displayed and the name of the worker who headed   the ... /, -7   the production cf the previous week.   Every workshop and each rolling mill and each individual worker has a set production limit  norm . Everything they produce over the norm counts in the producer's favour failure to   reach the norm is enquired into and may have serious consequences.    xiii The Director explained that the norm was set by him in consultation with his technical advisors. Sofnetimes they underestimated the normal pro duction possible and at times put the norm too high. The norm is passed to the manager of the workshop. He is responsible for its production. To be on the safe side of production he increases slightly the norm each unit has to produce. The quality of production is maintained and at the same time the workers are safeguarded against sweating. Most careful check is kept on production faulty manufacture or assembly or a sudden unexplained increase of it brings about an enquiry. The workers attend give information and are taken into full consultation. If necessary the norm is adjusted.   Similarly to safeguard the worker careful check is kept on accidents sickness absenteeism etc. and should the weekly statistics in any of these categories show marked increases produc tion is looked into and the norm is lowered if necessary.    xiv Stahanovites a certain percentage not only get a very increased rate of pay for extra production and additional bonuses but also an increase in their rations which amounts to 20 -25 over and above the heavy worker's ration.  xv Heavy at the Kirov works averages from 750 to 900 roubles a month net i.e. after union club or party levy sick benefit contribution etc. have been deducted and the various voluntary sub scriptions made to state loans or state lotteries  latter very popular .. Workers are provided free with overalls and all special clothing that may be necessary for their work.  xvi The roubles per month net. Stahanovites in addition to Increased rations mentioned above also receive extra clothing and commodity coupons also a certain number of free theatre and concert seats. Their papers ration cards and passes are all stamped Stahanovite which is very pleasing te their pride for they are respected for being what they are.  xvii The Kirov Communal a Dining rooms and b Dor mitories were shown to me by the Director after I had requested that he should do so on my asking him he replied Certainly but I must let the catering manageress know otherwise I'll get into trouble . About thirty-five minutes later we entered the dining room reserved for the personnel of ... /, -8   of the rolling mills. This was situated con veniently close to the workshop and was specially heated so that the workers could come straight in from the hot atmosphere of their workshop   without catching cold or having to put on extra clothing. The room v as drab and airless its   windows were boarded up and it was badly lit.   A loud-speaker blared in one corner. The usual full figure plaster cast of Stalin dominated the room and the walls were hung with the pictures of   past and present Soviet leaders. Everything looked rather grubby. There were about forty tables divided into four separate groups. The largest group of tables was reserved for the   heavy workers the next for the light workers.   The Stahanovites had fewer tables while the smallest number was reserved for clerks telephone operators etc. For each category there was a separate menu each category had a choice of dishes. The food was well cooked and decently served. Three full meals a day are served the last meal supper is prepared in such a way that the greater part of it can be taken home to eat later.   Prices of meals   Lowest category for 3 meals 5-7 roubles a day.   Tt 4- ll II A r aA II II   Light workers 6 -7.50   t itit   Heavy workers 7.50 -10   Stahanovites 9 -14.50 11   The catering manageress see Scrapbook said that no one could eat 14.50 roubles worth in one day.   They sometimes treated others nine of every ten took a portion of their ration home.   Workers have to surrender the appropriate portion of their ration cards the meals are however better than the food they could buy at their registered shops for in addition to being able to buy in bulk the factory restaurants get additional supplies of vegetables eggs bacon etc. from the factories' auxiliary farms see below .   Workers' rents gas electric light wireless and telephone fees are extremely low. Their greatest hardship is the terrible shortage of clothes the shortage of vodka 1 litre every three months if lucky and the shortage of tobacco. I visited a dining room in another part of the works where conditions were very similar to those reported above. As the workers using it had clean work the tables were covered by cloths.   The dormitories were improvised during the worst days of the 'siege and are no longer used. Con structed below ground level they are damp and very crowded five tiers of bunks one above the other nice and rats were kept down by daily chemical spraying.    xviii Workers studying approved courses for qualification in their profession or on language courses are excused two hours factory work a day. Their daily diet is also augmented.  xix The Kirov 'Works was particularly well provided with club /, -9    lub premises library class-rooms for night study cinemas etc. All these with the emergency hospital have been destroyed. It still possesses its own fully equipped hospital a mater nity hospital and sanatorium. As these are situ ated well to the east of Leningrad they have been saved.   Factory auxiliary farms are owned by nearly every factory in U.S.S.R. and are run on a large scale jointly by the management and workers for the benefit of the factory employees and their families.    xx Sixty feet below ground a complete reinforced concrete headquarters has been constructed. It is reached from the Director's siege-time office by long tunnels guarded by a series of steel doors anti-gas decontaminating chambers etc. There are about eight such entrances in all each equally well protected. Each part of the works look-out posts etc. is linked to the H.Q . by a deep-laid telephone wire. There is a direct wireless set to the fire station and Leningrad Military Headquarters.   This H.Q. is fully manned day and night and is run entirely on military lines. The whole place Is excellently air-conditioned heated and generates Its own electric light.   I spent an hour here looking at the records  see Part A I page 3 para.13 hearing tales of the siege when the heavy worker's ration was reduced to 175 gms. of bread per day with only a plate of soup made from a brewery's discarded yeast heap.    xxi The director told me that about 21% of the workers In 1941 total 35 000 were Party Members or accepted candidates for membership in the Communist Party B . This compared with other factories was a high percentage but the Kirov workers had always been very politically-minded. Since 1941 women workers have shown a great   interest in party work. Many have been accepted   into the party and the number of candidates waiting   for acceptance is very great.    k The Marinsky Theatre The great ballet and opera ensemble of this theatre was evacuated in 1941. The ensemble was split up into groups which have been working In the far eastern pro vinces of European Russia and Siberia. They have not only sought to entertain the population In the places of their evacuation but have taught and looked for new talent.   The enormous State Theatre itself was very badly damaged on various occasions during the siege but as the damage occurred repairs were effected. From the outside the building looks very mottled. But thanks to the repairs the theatre is almost ready to open it is hoped that it will do so on Sunday 5th April either with the ballet Swan Lake or the opera Ivan Susanin.   Directors ... /, -10-   Directors conducters soloists are already returning to Leningrad. Some of' the company travelled on the train from Moscow with the writer. I.have no doubt that the Marinsky will open as planned on 5th April next.    1 Two Theatres that never closed durlng the Leningrad Siege  i The Pushkin Theatre -light operatic and musical comedy. During my stay in Leningrad I visited this theatre twice. The first performance I saw was a wartime spy story -a musical drama featuring the Soviet Navy a crude sentimental fifth-rate sort of a show which the audience loved.   The house was packed well dressed and many of the audience still wore outer clothing for the theatre had only just commenced to be heated. Before the curtain j bse on the first act the Stage Director appeared before the audience and gave them full instructions on what to do in the event of an air raid alarm. The same procedure was followed at the other theatre I visited.   To my surprise during the first interval when I was teg talking to the producer of the show the administrator of the theatre asked if I would like to meet the leading mem bers of the cast. In the second interval some eight to twelve.artists came up to the administrator's office. We talked fairly freely for about twenty-five minutes I was interested in them they in the English Theatre. DfHy guides were with me bu-fc cuti   The longest performance during the siege had lasted nine and a half hours and had been interrupted by thirteen air raid warnings.   Three entirely new shows had been produced during the siege including new costumes and decor.   The second performance I saw at this theatre was a new original musical comedy based on Gogol's Tales of the Ukraine -a sort of La Kermesse Heroique . The direction had hoped to have their production ready for the recapture of Kiev. The Red Army beat them to it for the premier only took place some weeks after the capture of the city. It was a good show had lovely costumes and splendid scenery and lighting effects it was a production worthy of a Charles B. Cochran show at its best.   On my second visit during the first interval while sitting in the Administrator's office he was asked by telephone to despatch within twenty-four hours seven brigades i.e. seven separate theatrical/concert parties to entertain troops in frontal zones. The Administrator asked for time to look at his commitments before agreeing to do so as the request might entail a change in the theatre' s advertised programme. He was requested not to change the advertised programme if possible. In a few minutes he informed his caller that seven brigades could be made available provided they were not kept for more than a week in the Army zone. Then there followed a long telephone conversation with the caller about the rendezvous and transport arrangements of the seven brigades.   On this occasion I was invited to the Green Room here the whole company was assembled I made a short speech and invited questions. The greatest interest was shown in the English theatre how the Ensa companies worked   food ./, -11   food conditions in U.K. Britain's bombing of Germany  very much approved of the Second Front -here I plugged the sinking of the Scharnho rst and our keeping open the seas. Straight uncomprfanswers went down well. This session lasted for about forty minutes see scrap book .   Just as we were leaving the Green Room the Adminis trator told the company Re are required to send seven brigades for a tour of the front the day after to-morrow. The announcement was greeted with a general murmur of the equivalent of O' LorJ   Then came a series of questions    Is the Army providing rations'    Yes replied the Administrator.    Horosho good said the Green Room.    Are we going to be transported in buses or lorriesr    Lorries I'm afraid said the Administrator.    O' Lor sighed the Green Room.   At the end of the performance I was shown round the theatre's workshops wardrobes etc. and met the various heads of departments.    il The Gorki Theatre -dramatic and comedy   . This company during the siege produced three new plays Shakespeare's king Lear Gorki's Mestchanie and Shaw's Pygmalion in addition to its long list of plays in the repetoire.    I saw King Lear and Mestchanie both excellently produced and acted On each visit I spent an hour in the Green Room. The general interest of this company in Britain was greater than at the Pushkin theatre in particular as to theatrical matters. On my last visit the stage-door-keeper wearing five classes of the Imperial Order of St George an elderly ex-Czarist officer was presented. I was being honoured by the presentation and he In turn by being presented to me. Lvery moment in the Green Room was informal and friendly see Scrapbook.  m The Children of-Leningrad One sees a few over the age of seven all of them are well cared for and look healthy and full of vitality. They go in crocodile from their schools to parks etc. for recreation under the charge of their teachers.    n National Memo rials I was taken officially to visit the following    i General Kutuzov's grave in the Kazan Cathedral. This has been restored and is now kept as a shrine. It is impressively draped with Soviet and mourning flags. Opposite the grave in what used to be a chapel names of the holders of the Order of Kutuzov the new highest Soviet Military Order are inscribed on plaques of gold.  ii .../, -12    ii General Souvorov's tomb in the Alexander Nevsky Monastery. This was a plain stone sleb bedecked with red and mourning flags the monastery has suffered severely from' bombing and shell fire.  iii The tomb of Peter the Great in the Cathedral of Sts. Peter and Paul. His tomb is magnificently draped and is covered with a mass of artificial flowers. On the walls in letters of gold are inscribed his sayings about Russia and M-s-moropatriotic utterances. The other tombs of the Emperors and Empresses of Russia by contrast look a little lonely but the cathedral is kept spotlessly clean and all the shrines are visited frequently by the general population.  2 Leningrad Area  a Peterhof Of Peterhof the town little remains intact. Most of its houses and villas are damaged beyond repair. Fire and artillery have destroyed nearly all the trees that made the town so attractive.   Of the Palace at Peterhof the residential mansions around it and of the stables nothing remains bar walls and gaunt chimney-stacks. If anyone should think that this destruction was the natural ravage of war he would be wrong for next to all the wreckage the Lutheran chapel an octagonal building stands intact. Many of the marble Gothic figures that decorate the exterior of the walls remain undamaged in their niches. The reason why this building was not destroyed was that it was the German Kirche.   In the grounds the marble of the steps and balustrades leading from terrace to terrace have been looted and sent back to-Germany. The world famed waterfalls fountains and water-basins have been destroyed as have the canals and locks that controlled the flow of water to them. This destruction was premeditated scientific and deliberate and not the result of battle or conflict.   The renowned bronze statues of Samson Niobe and others were all taken down packed and sent intact to Germany. Everywhere one looked there were signs of vandalism. For instance the great Eastern Avenue of trees had been sawn down and the trunks lay across the avenue a mechanical saw had been used for the job. This act might have been understood if it had afforded the Germans a better field of fire or could hamper the Russians' approach for attack. But the destruction of the trees had neither of these purposes. It was a piece of destruction for destruction's sake.   -ing A most interest/fact that I gathered during my visit to Peterhof was that the re-war assistant curator of Peterhof was rc-called from his Artillery Unit on the Ukrainian front on 27th December 1943 and arrived in Peterhof two days after the Germans were driven out i.e. on 23rd January 1944 in good time to resume his duties.    b ... /, -13    b Gatchina Krasnogvardeysk The great Gatchina Palace was still smouldering on 1st February in hundreds of places. It has been totally destroyed by fire except for two small sections. The Russians cleared the Palace of all its treasure in 1941   -h40w -v- rthey-left the buildings intact. The-Germans lived in it for two and a half years years and then on 21st January they fired it.   I examined the walls which were unscarred by bullet or gun fire. The bronze statue of Paul I that faces the palace was likewise unmarked.   Here as at Peterhof the curator was back at his post.   The Germans fired about a quarter of the town Defore abandoning it. Others/have been badly damaged by shell fire. buasu s   On the road some ten kilometres out of Gatchina in the middle-of nowhere we passed little groups of women on foot dragging sledges after them. Before v/e left Gatchina they had reached their home town. Seeing some of the returned ones being greeted in the main street by some who had survived the German occupation and others standing looking dumbly at their burnt out houses was an unforgettable sight.   On 2nd February on the way to Kingisepp We met many other groups of women and some children returning on foot towards the liberated towns and villages. On more than one occasion they had been overtaken by transport columns and once by a battery of heavy self-propelled guns. The women had hitched their sledges to the vehicles and were sitting on lorries or on the guns and were obviously on the happiest of terms with the men of the'-Red army.    c Pushkin Tsarskoye Selo The Palace the gardens grounds and town are all in ruins. But here the sight is not so appalling. For the damage done is not the result of wanton vandalism. It is obvious that a hard battle has been fought all round this centre.   The fighting in the town was of the house to house kind. The Palace had been defended and attacked. Russian and German burnt out or disabled tanks were still in the streets where they had been put out of action.   A Russian self-propelled gun had charged a German medium tank at a corner of the main street. The German tank lay turned over burnt out under the front of the smashed up Russian gun.   For the last tvrenty years Peterhof Gatchina and Pushkin have not only been the playgrounds of the Lenin grad- tes but the Mecca of the vast tourist traffic that has travelled all over the Soviet Union to see the national gems of the Worth . Their destruction has caused deep sorrow and has touched the people's pride the wanton vandalism has added fresh flame to the nation's hatred of the invader Russia wants and means to have revenge.    d /, -14    d The Ladoga Traasa Ladoga-Leningrad Arterial Road The construction of this double well separated broad concrete arterial road was commenced in November 1941 and and completed 1 1942. Its making was subject to con tinuous air bombing. I drove some seventeen kilometres from Leningrad along the highway. At every kilometre post there were concrete M.G pillboxes anti-tank obstruc tions and shelters for drivers and garrison also separate shelters with telephones for road controllers. At about every five kilometres there were concrete emplacements in which lorries could be parked repaired etc. The parallel roads for up-and-down traffic are interconnected about every four to six kilometres.. The road is still fully' used and fully manned as regards control posts etc. At the time of my visit the A.A. batteries very numerous were also still in position.   Great craters on either side of the highway bear witness to the intensity of German bombing the patched up surface of the road-way eloquently tells one of the accuracy of the bombing. Scores of smashed up and burnt out lorries sledges and carts strewn on the edge of the highway show what it cost to keep the road open.   I was told by the controller of the road that at times in the early spring of the hard winter of 1942 and again in the early months of the winter of 1943 the roads-were so blocked by bombing that supplies' had to b e off-loaded from lorries on to sledges which were mandragg'ed into the city.   The Ladoga Trassa undoubtedly enabled Leningrad and the Leningrad front to hold out until the liberating offensive was launched by the Red Army in January 1944.    Conclusion of PART B. To be continued ., MOST SECRET 10m   13th February 1944.   Memorandum of a Tour made by a Brltlsh   Officer from Moscow to Leningrad and parts of the LehThgrad Front between 29th January and 5th February 1944    Continued   Addenda to Part A.  . i   Allied Food Supplies   Any British or American officer who enters the Leningrad battlefields or travels over the railways leading to the city can easily suppose unless otherwise informed that he is following in the wake of a British or American Force. Wherever-he may look he will see on station sidings and in fields discarded tins with Fnglish inscriptions many setting forth in detail  four different ways of dishing up the contents in a tasty manner.   In every . 3 store there-are sacks of sugar flour rice etc. labelled in English. The Red Army kn'ows full well that these supplies come from the Allies and they appreciate the fact.   Moreover the civilian population '1not only of Leningrad and Moscow but of other towns throughout Russia get their rations augmented by Allied supplies and are grateful for all they get.   PART 0   ECONOMIC SITUATION    1 Theeconomic food situation of Leningrad is governed by the military needs of the Army on the front the available transport facilities.   From a starvation level in October 1943 the Leningrad- tes of to-day are receiving the all too meagre rations allotted to the population of Moscow.    2 Rationing System of U.S.S.R. and February Rations of Leningrad and Moscow  A CIVILIAN General  I Rationing is divided into four main categories but the special privileges enjoyed by certain categories and the Soviet practice of reward bonuses make the system seem very complicated to the uninitiated. II The Basic Ration a B. C D Workers Workers black-ChiIdren Dependants coated etcT   Gms. Gms-. ' Gms. Gms. Bread per day 550 450 300 300 Meat or Fish per month 2 200 1 200 600 600 Fats 800 400 ' 300 200 Cereals macaroni 2 000 1 500 1 000 1 000 Sugar 500 300 300 200 Salt 400 400 400 400 Tea 25 . 25 25 25 Matches boxes 3 3 3    iii .../, -2   iii Notes on the Basic Ration   Under Column As    a Thpse engaged in very hea y work in rolling mills engine drivers etc. get 100 gms. of bread in addition i.e. 650 gms. per day. Workers 1 ration cards are given to all manual and heavy factory workers engineers engine and tram drivers and conductors printers actors and actresses musicians circus artists writers journalists ' teachers painters factory managers trusts and those engaged in a directional or executive capacity in the numerous state enterprises.    b Stahanovites get 20 to 25 i over and above the worker's basic ration.  c Men and women who render specia] services to the State or community such as leading architects leader writers noted authors academic-ia-ns- scientists pro fessors surgeons doctors ' artists of the ballet opera drama musical comedy and circus who have been given State honours and holders of certain senior Soviet Orders receive a worker's basic ration plus as much as three or four full worker's basic rations for themselves. Under Column B   This is a static ration.   Under Column C   Children up to 7 years get a regular ration of milk natural dried or soya etc. In addition if they attend children's community dining rooms or are cared for in the daily hostels they receive sweet meats biscuits and at times fruit.   I   Children over seven up to school leaving age get at midday two sandwiches some milk and sometimes fruit   A child acquaintance of the writer aged twelve   announced on one occasion that on that day they had had tangarines. On enquiring the quantity he was told four.    What he asked in surprise you all got four    No only .the first five in our class I'm one of them the others only got three.    Four tangarines 7   The child laughed.    No of course not four tangarines four pigs'    i.e. four pieces . Under Column D   This category is the most distressed and starved group in U.S.S.R It consists of people who are too old op infirm to work i.e. non-working mothers grandparents aged uncles and aunts -these as in all other countries are to be lound in nearly every   family ... /, and therefore if.they are lucky the onus of keeping their bodies and souls together it is scarcely possible on this ration alone for long falls on the members of the family who come under a higher category and share it with their dependants.   It is of interest' to note that all household servants employed by foreigners in U S 8 R. and most of their other employeesare given automatically  'Dependants ration cards. This throws the responsibility of feeding the employee on the foreign employer. It is a very heavy burden    iv Ration categories A 3 and D receive from time to time an issue of Milk Coffee Kerosene Sunflower-seed oil and -a quantity of Vodka or-Wine about once in three months.  v At the commencement of each month a list of the various commodities and quantities available are publicly announced. But this does not mean that such rations will be issued When any given product is not available some other is if possible substituted.  ' Bor instance. in lieP of a Kilogram of meat ' 15 eggs may be issued or egg powder .. -   Kote   Egg powder Russian or Allied is most unpopular with the Russians. Whey would rather have 15 doubt ful eggs. than the equivalent in egg powder. American and Russian dried milk is popular also that manufactured from the Soya bean but all other substitutes are very unpopular. There has been no fresh milk in Leningrad since the Autumn of 1941.    vi How Ration. Cards are issued throughout U.S...S.R.   All classes of the population have to have their ration cards re-newed every month. The procedure is a vexatious bureaucratic one.   After the 22nd of each month the individual has to get a standartnoya spravka e.g. a card from his house committee certifying that he is legally registered on the hous e. regis ter and. is domiciled at the h0U3 e. This card has then to be taken to the employer who certifies the nature of the employee's employment and affixes an official seal. The card is then taken to the regional food office and exchanged for a ration card. This in turn has to be stamped by the employer and house committee before it can be registered .with the retailers.   The work and time the above procedure entails is enormous. At times both the Standartnoya spravka and\ration cards come late from the pri.ntera shortage of paper . The rule is no food without ration cards. In consequence there is sometimes delay of 4 to 5 days at the commencement of a month before the Consumer gets rations.   From about 2.3rd to 1st of every month there prevails pretty well everywhere an air of tension and agitation. At all large apartment houses long queues of people are to be seen in the evenings waiting to get into the office of the house committee., /    vii Higher Grade of Nations than the Basic Ration para 2 above There aro 5 main oategorios of people who get larger and better rations than the heavy workers basic ration.    a The Army e.g. fighting forces b the Government Senior Soviet Administrators and holders of high state office c N.K.V.D. d The Diplomatic Corps and Allied Military Missions e Tho Militia.  B THE ARMY. With the exception of b The Government Senior Soviet Administrators etc and e N.K.V.D the Army and expecially the forces in the field get the highest and best rations in the country. When the civilian population say  Everything goes to the Army they know they are telling the truth. And the Array knows that for all practical purposes it receives the best that the land has. To the civilian the above knowledge when time and again the b lt has to be pulled in is of little physical comfort but to most there comes a pride that helps them to bear their hunger.   Men of the forces on leave bring back with them what they have been able to save out of rations and carry for their comrades parcels of food for relatives This is encouraged by the Authorities for it shows the population that the Army is getting enough.   The forces in the field get a regular small issue of vodka a fairly liberal ration of tobacco or cigarettes   Soldiers airmen and sailors are as well clothed and equipped as they are fed. In this fact at least 75 of the population take a pride.    G RATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT SENIOR SOVIET ADMINISTRATORS ETC. These are the highest and best in U.S.S.R members of the family in this category receive the same high ration. The writer has no details as to quantities. This category buys its provisions etc. from shops closed to the public and entrance to which can only be obtained by a special pass.    D N.K.V D. Senior officers of both sexes in this service get the second highest ration in U.S.S.R. They too want for nothing. Junior officials other ranks in the N.K.V.D. get the same ration as the Army. The N.K.V.D has very special Auxiliary Farms of its own as well as special shops where they can buy clothes furniture at controlled prices and other things that the rest of the population has to do without.    E THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS & ALLIED illLITARY MISSIONS. The ration for senior members including an issue of spirit and wine is slightly lower than that given to senior ranks of The Red Army.   Junior mombofs secretaries clerks etc. get a much smaller ration.   The writer as head of a separate mission in Moscow gets as do the heads of the Military Air and Naval Sections of the British Mission about 33 higher ration than the,  5   other officers in the mission. The same applies to the other Aliied Missions  The Oiplomatic Corps and Missions shop at a special reserved store Entrance is gained only by card. There is also a Diplomatic Shop at which certain goods  shoes shirts socks etc. can be bought within the very small limit of the clothing card.  Certain favoured foreigners such as press correspond ents engineers and foreigners in the employ of the Soviet Government are also given permission to use these  Diplomatic Shops . Their rations are however muih lower   F THE MILITIA. Ranks corresponding to Inspector and above get a higher ration than the junior commissioned ranks in the Army Lower ranks the same ration as the Army  CONSUMERS REGISTRATION PITH RETAILERS.  This is simple in U.S.S.R. as in the main every store sells meat fish groceries etc. and often bfead as well.   There are however many bread shops at which the consumer can register. In large cities -there are one or two stores reserved for the favoured categories only. Some shops only supply heavy workers Stahanovites and their families but the majority are open to all categories.  The consumer registers for the month but is in no way tied to a particular shop for on the following month he or she may register at another shop providing it can accommodate the customer.  Shops distribute supplies in periods of 10 days decada i.e 1st to 10th 11th to 20th and 21st to end of month. Customers who may have to leave a district buy up to the  decada and get a certificate that enables them to register at another shop.   4 TYPES OF STORES. During my visit to Leningrad I went over four classes of store   a Gastranome No.l reserved for .those of the highest category . TEis used to be the famous St Petersburg Store Eliseavo on the Nevski. It is run like any first class Yes tern store. The goods are well displayed everything spotlessly clean. Certain customers can book orders by telephone and have them delivered. It has over 7 000 fully registered customers e.g who buy their full ration and 2 200 who take one meal or more a day at a Communal dining room and therefore are only entitled to part of their ration. I went over the store refrigeration rooms bakery etc all of which were excellently maintained. -Entrance to the shop is only by pass.  NOTE-  The late Eliseave s shop in Moscow likewise only  caters for the higher categories. Part of it with  a separate entrance is reserved for the Diplomatic  Corps   b A large store near the Kirov Works This supplied only heavy worker and Sta hanovite categories. It, 6   was as clean as Gastranome No.l It had 2 600   fully registered customers and 5 700 who took one or more meals at a Communal dining room    c & d Two smaller stores catering for all categories. One had 1 200 fully registere d customers and over 2 000 part registered. The other 900 fully registered and 1 200 part registered. These were also both spotlessly clean   Each of these stores had suffered from bombardment in particular the last three but had been patched up over and over again. They had remained open throughout the siege even when there were only 100 grams of bread a day per customer''.    5 COMUNAL DIIUPG ROOMS. The communal dining room first came extensively into use following the years of famine 1922 -1928 Prom then communal feeding at factories -trusts and state enterprises etc became more and more popular. Since 1941 most workers take at least the main-meal of the day at a Communal centre. They probably have come to'stay in U.S.S.R   Any meal in a Communal dining room is better than could be got ready at the home for a family of seven consisting of 2 heavy workers' 1 employee's 2 children's and 2 Dependants' rations. To make Communal feeding more popular these centres receive supplies that are not available in the shops.   Throe Communal centres -at the writer's request -were visited in Leningrad Two on the.morning of the visit received warning to expect a visitor. The third had no 'warning. I was accompanied by the Deputy Leningrad Pood Commissar rank assistant National Commissar a man the Director of Leningrad Communal Restaurants. a woman the Director of the Union of Cooks and restaurant employees a man the Medical Inspector of Restaurants and catering establishments a woman the Deputy director of transport for catering establishments a man and my two guides''1   RESTAURANT A.   Catered for workers including Stakhanovites andlower ration categories. It was a humble type .of centre and had once been a shop. The place consisted of two long narrow dining rooms smallish kitchen store and washing up rooms and Cloak room. The rooms wore airless and badly lit. Tables were closely packed and covered with American cloth each seating four The establishment was staffed by women there was an obvious shortage of waitresses. At the time of inspection it was about f-full. The tables near the entrance door cold and drafty wore reserved for Dependant customers they could not sit at high category tables. Outer garments of all customers had to bo loft at the Cloak room free   The place looked grubby but was moderately clean. Food w.as served up on properly washed plates etc. No smoking allowed. The kitchen was clean. The store rooms very tidy. Cooks and scullions wore linen coats and their hair was covered by white caps.   This centre served 250 customers with 3 meals a day breakfast dinner supper and had an additional 600 customers who took the dinner only. Supper as at the factories is prepared so that a part of it or all can be taken home., 7   At each meal the menu for each ration category had a choice of two or more principal dishea .   The cost for 3 meals var/ied. from Roubles 3 50 to 8 per day.   The food looked fair but the employee and dependant portions were very meagre.   The manageress had been in charge for 15 months. Customers registered at the centre from the 1st of each month and apart from having to-take meals for a month they are in no way tied to the restaurant. In the event of going away or having to move to another part of the City during the month they can be signed off on presentation of a certificate. If only going for a day or so they can take their food in advance. If ill a relative or friend may collect the meals. The whole system seems flexible and reasonable -and the diner is treated as a customer '   The Manageress stated that with her equipment and staff she could cater for about another hundred customers. Asked how customers were obtained she replied by diner's reccramendition l and added with pride that her centre had the reputation of serving particularly good soups this was duo to the skill of her chef   I compared the day smony the weight of food and calory value with that of the previous month. The improvement was enormous I then asked to see a menu of January 1943 The books were turned up. -The record showed what a starvation diet really is. It was horrible.   The Manageress her staff and customers answered my questions most freely. It was a very pleasant change to have attendant Snviet officials who encouraged requests for inform ation .   RESTAURANT B..   This was a much larger establishment and served a better class of customer. It catered for all categories but each category had its own dining room. These promises too had once been a large shop. The rooms f re spacious and airy windows unshuttered to admit the daylight. The whole plaoe was spot lessly clean. Tables were covered with a-cloth and each had a vase with artificial flowers.   The quantity of -the employee .and dependant rations was the same as at the other establishment but better cooked and looked more appetizing In the kitchen boy 11 to 12 years old apprentices worked under the cooks. The scullery had mechanical dish washers potato peelers etc. The serving staff was adequate and the service quick. There was also a simple system of. making out bills at the time of taking an order. The four dining rooms were Tabled respectively Dependant 1  Employee i/orkers Stakhanov te.and Militia Service and arrangements in each-room seemed to be the same it was the menu and quantity of the food that was different in each.   This centre served 600. customers with 3 meals a day and 450 with dinner only.   The cost for a day's meals 3 varied between 4 Roubles and 14 Roubles.   Smoking was not permitted in the dining room., In the top dining room tho Militia had a long table to themselves. Tho chief of the district firo brigade  obviously a popular figure with those conducting mo see scrap book was taking his meal with tho militia. Wo joinod him had a plato of soup and listened to him and others on their firo fighting experiences during tho siogo.   RESTAURANT C.   I had hoard about Infant Community dining rooms. At tho ond of tho visit to rostaurant B I asked to bo taken over one. My conductors agreed without hesitation Tho diroctor of restaurants was anxious to take mo to tho best of those. But this meant a long drive to tho othor ond of Leningrad time did not permit this. She and tho Modical Inspector conforrod montionod 3 or 4 possiblo ones and finally mado their choice. Our party ontorod two cars and wo drove direct to tho rostaurant. This was tho ono inspoctod without tho managomont having boon warned to expoct a visitor.    6 TEE INFANTS'RESTAURANT.  a Purposo. Infants between tho agesof 3 and 7-Â§-yoars whoso parents havo such work or livo under such conditions that it is not practical to food thorn at homo. But tho infants only go for moals and do not as those who attond hostels remain tho wholo day.    b Admittance. Before boing allowed to attend such a centre tho infant must be vottod at tho district poly-clinic. Hero its weight etc. is taken and a cortificato mado out to tho rostaurant prescribing diet etc Thoroaftor each child is vottod monthly by tho poly clinic doctor at tho feeding centre    c Up to 4 yoars a parent or guardian may bo with tho infant whilo it has its moal but such persons may not oat their own moals on tho promises  d Tho cost of 3 meals is from 3 to 5 roubles por day. If tho parents aro not in a position to pay such a price they can obtain a cortificato by which tho samo moals aro supplied at a roducod cost at tho expense of tho state. Payment has to bo mado for moals 10 days in advance generally 50 roubles and any balance is carried forward to tho next docada . Children aro not allowed to bring this monoy in person and aro not oncouragod to know what tho cost of the meals is. Whoro parents aro able to provide break fast and suppor an infant may go to tho contro for tho main moal of tho day  o Tho contro visitod was on tho ground floor of an old fashioned'house. It consisted of throe modium sized interconnected rooms kitchen and cloak room. Tho ceilings woro low windows small tho atmosphere stuffy. It had boon used as a contro for nine yoars Tho walls woro docoratod in nursery stylo with animals otc. tho furniture was designed for tho uso of infants. Tho placo was clean. It catored for 35 taking 3 moals a day and 20 who only had dinner., 9-   Each room was in charge of a trainod not qualified youngish woman. They woro white coats  rathor soilod over thoir ordinary clothes About 20 infants wore present. The food looked good and suitablo for children. Milk was plenti ful.    f .The matron who was also cook received us. She was somewhat agitated by the sud.don invasion of our party of eight. Grown up chairs wore brought and she was then instructed by the d.iroCtor of the restaurants to toll me about the contra and to answer my questions. Before she. could commence a young woman see .scrap book in a spotloss white c'oat came up to us and fiorcoly demanded to know why we were all in our outer clothes and the men smoking Tho wretched men had not had a smqke for about throe hours and had lit up in the cars. Tho food Commissar tho doctor and diroctor of restaurants- whom sho knew assured her every thing v/as in order and sho need not worry. But tho young woman would not have it. She was sho asserted in charge of tho controls dieiplino. Wo would tako off our outer clothing in tho cloak room put out cigarettes or got out   Rather like naughty children wo oboyed. The young woman did not thaw for about half an hour.    g The childron looked healthy and wore woli behaved one had. a screaming bout and.another wept both in a normal.manner and for tho reason that they  did not approve of tho intrusion of tho visitors  h Prom tho outset infants are taught table manners etc. The atmosphere was a happy one.  i While still there the'doctor from the Poly-clinic came over specially and brought tho records of tho children. She talked about tho problems and disclosed failures of childron recovering from the starvation period epidemic's and other problems with great frankness. Prom tho description of tho Rationing syjtom the retail distribution arrangements and the various typos of Communal dining contresit will bo seen that in the   U.S.S.R. there is no equality'in such vital matters of life and living. On this score I have hoard little grunbling and found no inforiority complox on tho part of those of low ration category. The principle of- Prom each according to his ability to each according to his work seems to have boon accoptod by most. There is a most definite gonopal striving.to got into a higher good category oven if-it means-giving up comfortable and secure employment for a mqch harder typo of work. It is important for readers unacquainted with U.S.S.R. to realize that tho rationing described above whether bought at stores or consumed at community feeding centres is absolutely comprehensive at controlled prices., .0 i   -10 -   Thoro aro 1-n Europoan U.S.S.R no restaurants toa or coffoo shops snack or milk bars public houses whoro ono can buy food and drink as in Groat Britain. During tho sunonor in tho stroots aoratod water nay bo bought from Kiosks which is mado palatable by.tho addition of a minuto quantity of fruit juice.   Tho Aragvi is tho only restaurant in Moscow whoro foroignors can arrange to havo a moal minimum two persons in a priv'ato room. Soviet citizens othor than those ontortaining officially11 aro not allowed this privilege. At this restaurant an ordinary meal for two with vodka a cheap bottle of Gaucausion wine and coffee costs a minimum of 300 roubles o.g. 3 at 100 roubles to  6 at 48.50 to and 12 at tho official Soviet rate of exchange .   Tho only way a Soviet Citizen can augment his rations is by. buying on the Market.    8 THE MARKET. This very often is referred to by foroignors as tho Black Market. It is nothing of tho kind. It is a Togitimato institution whore collective farmers from near by and others having food or goods in kind can sell their produce or ware. Tho vendor pays a high tax to tho market authorities tho buyer does not.   In. Moscow thoro. are about a dozen such markets four boingytho' contro of the. City but tho best ones' are on tho outskirts. In Leningrad thoro is one in the City and two or throe in tho north-eastern suburbs   Tho markets aro enclosed strictly policed and care fully watched by N.K.V.D. detectives for.stolon or illegal goods.   The prices on tho market aro fantastic. For instance controlled price of eggs Jan. 1944 20-24 roubles for ton. Market price 250 to 350 roubles for ton. Moat controlled 18 roubles per Kilo market 325 roubles per Kilo.   Tho markets aro always crowded with buyers. Most of them buy very small quantities an egg apple onion 125 gr. of moat in order to augment however slightly tho all too meagre official ration.    9 COLLECTIVE AND STATE FARMS. Those have food in plenty but little moans of trans porting any surplus to tho towns and cities. They havo a terrible shortage of sugar tobacco Kerosene for lighting purposes and all manufactured goods particularly shoo leather noodles cotton household utensils etc. which they cannot purchase in tho towns    Conclusion of Part C.

Continued   PART D.   V 1   TRANSPORT SITUATION    1 Every form of rail road and water transport throughout the Siviet union is governed by  a .Military movementsj  b Transport of food and supplies to the fronts and of raw materials for war industries. In order to fulfil these primary needs the cities and towns have to be kept on a level of starvation and passenger traffic has to be cut to a minimum.    2 THE RAILWAYS.     a The greatest burden of transport has fallen on the railways. They have come well out of the tost and have not broken under the strain. The achievement is due to the officioncy of the administration and tho devotion of tho rank and filo of railway workers. In general the railways have not boon taken ovor by the military authorities but in tho oarly part of 1943 they wore made subject to military discipline. Every department cf the railways and all employees work on tho 'norm principle. Eacn branch has its   ' Stakhanovito workers   Tho Soviet Government has paid particular attention during tho war to all railway matters. Achiovomonts are publicised tho personnel praised lavishly rewarded with honours and when necessary most severely criticised. From time to time in tho  Pravda and isvostia devastating and scathing attacks are made on some department station or section that is failing to pull its weight -a form of rebuke dreaded by all railway workers.   So far tho railways have boon able to keep pace with tho Soviet Army's advance to tho West Railway workers I talked to while in no way minimising tho formidable task before them seemed confident that it would bo possible to continue to do so.    b ROLLING STOCK. General maintenance is excellent. On tho Leningrad trip a number of engines were seen that had been evacuated from Kiev ahd converted from oil burners to wood burners at Gorki. Tho markings showed the work to have boon done in 1943. Tho majority of tho engines, /    2   Tivoro old wood burning ones but this did not provont them from pulling very long hoavy loads.   Some of tho oil fuel onginos soon botwoon Moscow and Bologna were registered as having had capital overhaul between November 1942 and March 1943.   FREIGHT ROLLING STOCK.   Oldest car seen should have had a capital over haul in 1938. Many were seen that had had their capital overhaul in 1942 and 1943 and would next require capital overhaul in 1947 and 1948.   A considerable number of freight cars showed' scars of war but had temporarily been patched up and made serviceable.   Particular care is taken of axle greasing the hot boxes so common of yore in Russia are things of the past.   By decreo all typos of rolling stock may'bo overloaded from 10 to 25 above pre-war weight. Freight cars designed to carry 40 soldiers now pack in 45 and a stove for heating when possible.   PASSENGER ROLLING STOCK   Extremely well cared for. Each passenger coach is in charge of two attendants of either sox who do twelve hours on and twelve off. They occupy a small coup6. They.are responsible for the cleanli ness of tho coach inside and out heating admittance of passengers and for discipline.   The train from Moscow to Leningrad consisted of 2 postal waggons 1 express freight 1 International sleeper and 11 first and third coaches 5 of these were 1st and 3rd sleepers and 1 was reserved for senior officers .   Each long distance passengor train carries a doctor as a rule in last year before becoming fully qualified and a nurse both women. Tho carriages lavatories etc. are kept very clean    c TROOP MOVEMENTS SOVIET On 30th January and 4th February many troop trains were seen between Bologoe and Tikhvin. The longest train consisted of 53 freight and open waggons tho latter loaded with tanks guns lorries and bridging materials. Tanks guns etc. had personnel with them on the open waggons. Every two or three of those carried an off-loading ramp so that freight could bo unloaded irrospoctivo of platforms.   None of those trains wore camouflaged only one had an A.A. battery two guns ready for action and three of tho trains soon had two oil tankers each    d OIL TANKERS. From markings on some seen on the way to Leningrad it was evident that they come direct from south of Rostov.,  f CONTROL ON RAILWAYS Thoro aro sentries on all bridges. On stations railway police aro much in evidence passengers aro scrutinised at ticket offices and on boarding the trains. On leaving Moscow district and Leningrad district trains aro inspected while travelling. All passengers' passes are checked.    g MOTES.  1 Uniforms Prom 1st March all railway employees aro to have uniforms of a new pattern epaulets aro to be introduced much to the satisfaction of all. A womonfe complete uniform greatcoat tunic skirt and summer blouse will cost about 500 roubles. This can be paid for out of salary over a period of 18 months.    2 Railway Wages. Per month m roubles Senior engine drivor after all deductions.. ... ... 500 -600   Junior engine driver after all deductions... ... ... ... 450 -500   Doctor after all deductions ... 500   Attendant  ... 350 -400   These receive free quarters fuel and light and working clothes necessary for their job.aro provided free.    3 Observation about the enemy.  i A number of Soviet railway workers said that the Germans during occupation made no attempt to mask as Russians do signal lights. Engines at night kept head lamps full on. The same applied to the lights of motor traffic on the roads  ii Germans had found groat difficulty in using wood fuel for engines especially when damp a difficulty Russian stokers have mastered  3 ROAD TRAMSPORT. This is almost exclusively used for military purposes.   In Moscow and Leningrad there are no taxis or cabs and only officials have cars.    4 WATER TRAMSPORT. This has boon utilized to the full. The shortage of oil fuel has complicated the problem. In the spring of 1943 explosives wore used in canals and on certain stretches of rivers in order to break up the ice earlier than it would otherwise do.,  5 THE METRO Work on tho extension of the Moscow underground syston has proooodod since Eobruary 1943 rocently'd-now stations woro opened 7ork on tho now Leningrad Metro not opened is to proceed shortly.    Conclusion of Part D. To bo c ontinued ., 13th February 1944.   MOST SEGRI   /   Memorandum of a Tour made by a British Off1cer from Moscow to Lenfngrad' an d parts of Fhe Leningrad' Front between 29th January and 5th February 1944    Continued   PART E   POLITICAL SITUATION    1 FEBRUARY 1943 -FEBRUARY 1944  a February 2nd 1943 -German Army at Stalingrad finally surrounded and liquidated. In the 12 months that followed that epic victory much has happened in the Soviet Union that has and will continue to affect profoundly the political situation of the state and the attitude of its peoples in regard to home and foreign policy.   The main home and International events that will affect the Russians were    i -The' steady and progressive successes of the Red Army and the recovery of enemy occupied territory.    ii The reintroduction of epaulets in the services.  Hi Educational reform.    iv Severing of diplomatic Government in London.  v The dissolution  vi The restoration of the Orthodox Church .  vii The Moscow Conference.  viii The Teheran Conference.  ix The.recent January/February 1944 Constitutional reforms.  b Soviet Public Opinion Home Affairs I In regard to home affairs the average Russian is well informed. Interested in the most diverse ques. tions and is Intelligent In weighing up matters concerning the economic conditions and development of the country. Such subjects are debated not only at   - meetings where personal opinions are freely expressed but in the home and at work Russians have become in the last 25 years omnivorous readers. In con sequence the press is by far the most potent medium for the diffusion of ideas. The prime function of the Soviet press is to keep its own people informed as regards home matters.   A Soviet paper or journal is packed with si reading matter it is not set out In the Britil or American style with attractive head-lines to catch the eye and make skimming easy nor does It   aim /, V. V\   I 'ra   -2   aim to do so. Its aim is to instruct. The average reader reads the paper right through Every street and square has its wall.newspaper boards where within a short time of publication the1 'Pravda11 and Isvestia'1 etc. appear. These are well pat ronised. The longest queues in the towns are to be found at the newspaper kiosks.    ii The Successes of the Red Army Prom the Press broadcasting lectures and the men back on leave the public knows what the Army has achieved. It is proud and very conscious of these successes. It also knows the cost for casualties are not hidden. Not only does the public read how the country is bleeding but it also knows this from personal loss. This depressing fact coupled with the scarcity of food and other war hardships shows itself in a general note of weariness in all sections of the population. The question When when will the war be over is asked countless-times a day. The-general morale is good but there is no dis guising the tiredness of the people and it is a factor that must be borne in mind. It is one certainly recognised by the Soviet Government. This explains why the Government goes to such lengths to make the Russian people feel that they are carrying the whole burden of the struggle against.Nazism and Fascism and is in part the reason for the ungenerous appre ciation in the Soviet press of the Allies' efforts and sacrifices   iii Epaulets in the Services   This was a most popular and successful innovation in the services'and greatly liked by the population. It has consolidated the position of the new govern ing class and officer caste    iv Educational Reform Parents with whom the subject has been discussed in Baku Kuibishev Gorkie Moscow and Leningrad approve almost v/ithout exception of the abolition of co-educati.on and the putting of teachers and pupils into uniform. There is not quite as unanimous an approval of the introduction of military training for boys over 12 girls receive specialised training for war work though most think and hope that this will enable the period of conscription to be cut in the. future. They argue that if this is so uni versity studies and work will be less interfered with at an important period of life by military service.   The new Suvorov boarding schools organised on the old Imperial Cadet Corps lines .are very popular.    v Dissolution of the Comintern For most of the population this was a 'nine days' wonder'. After that it. meant very little to them. In some towns the streets called Comintern Street are being re-named causing the usual amount of con fusion and annoyance.   But to some Russian Communist Party Members notably   among .. /, -3   among a number of the older ones tho abolition came as an unexpected shock. The decision was received with regret and misgiving. They felt a principle a very important principle was being thrown over to please foreign opinion in particular that of U.S.A. and the British Empire.   There is a strong group of isolationists in the Communist B Party of Russia. These too regretted the abolition of the Comintern.    vi The Restoration of the Patriarchate This far reaching step at present would seem to be very little appreciated by the general population. It is to my mind a much more important step as regards the foreign policy of U.S.S.R. I associate it to. th a definite aim on the part of the N.K.I.D. for a tie-up in Bulgaria Greece Rumania and Yugoslavia who are all members of the Orthodox Church. To them the Holy Synod has a very definite meaning.   The visit of the Archbishop of York and the clergy who accompanied him received a marked appreciation from the believing part f the Russian population. This section of the population are beginning to reap the reward for having remained loyal to the Church and to Christian principles.   While the Church of England has for many years been working toward co-operation with the Orthodox Church I think that there is also a possibility of the Russians now wishing to find a working arrangement vid th the Catholic Church.   There are dozens and dozens f villages in   U.S.S.R. that have not got a Church. There is a great community who want to have the Churches opened. It would seem from recent developments that within the next ten years that desire will tee satisfied. Among the older generations 45-80 j ears of age   religion means a great deal though many for the last 20 years have been very secretive abou their   religious convictions. Among the young that is   not' the case. But even within the writer's very limited contacts he has found people who profess Christianity and practice it among the younger    17-21 age groups. These have come to Christianity on their own. The great stress that has overcome their country has turned them towards religion.   In Leningrad I saw two funeral processions with priests following in the wake of the coffin and Church attendants behind Dhem   On the 10th May at the Pan-Slav conference there were 70-80 priests in the Colum Hall in their robes wearing their crosses sitting with their wives in various parts of the Hall.   The address of the Arch-Bishop of Kiev and Galitzia was an unforgettable one.   In ../, -4  In the first days of this year I took General Donovan U.S.A. to look at Kolomenska near Moscow This is a very old Russian centre where once upon a time a great palace stood. One of the old forceful Russian impresses had the palace torn down and re-erected in a more salubrious spot. All that now remains is the Cathedral which also served in their time as a falconry lodge for the Emperors there are also a Church and a number of buildings used as museums.   I took General Donovan into the Church where a service was in progress. There were about a hundred worshippers present mostly elderly and 75 ' of them were women. At the end of the service the priest came and talked to us. For about ten minutes I translated the conversation between General Donovan and the priest.   Then to my utter surprise the priest addressed me in very fair English. Sir he said You. speak Russian excellently We discussed current affairs of the day. I promised to send him English papers and magazines. He told me that he had taken orders two years ago because he had an urge to do so.   So often one hears it said that it is devilish cunning of the ruling caste in Russia to restore the Church and fill it with its own agents. This is a supposition which has yet to be proved. I am satisfied that there will be a great control over the clergy in Russia for niany years to come. But I am not satisfied that the Russian authorities are cynically re-establishing the Church with an ulterior purpose they are utilising this apparent latent force just as they have utilised the latent nationalism within the heart of the average Russian since the German attack on U.S.S.R to develop a Nationalist complex.    vii Hie Moscow Conference and  viii The Teheran Conference . The understanding and the results of these conferences were given great prominence in the Press and the re-action on the public was most marked. For years the Russians have known the danger of talking to foreigners. Any Russian doing so was under suspicion. That fear is still nursed by most Russians. They feel there is a definite risk in being associated with a foreigner. Bu.t the directive given in the press loosened up many of the Russians who have a curiosity and an interest in foreigners. This loosening up may be one of the causes for the Pravda article for the Government of Russia has no intention to stand by and watch whilst we establish a Forum for foreign relationship. The foreigner is still held up as a bogey with which to frighten those with a liberal turn of mind. That is a fact that must be borne in mind by all foreign observers.    ix The Recent January/Pebruary 1944 Constitutional ReTorms. ' The proposal at the meeting of The Supreme soviet of the TJ.S.S.R held on the . 31st January and 1st February 1944 to amend the Constitution caused great interest excitement and comment.   The ./, 5   The motion put before the Supreme Council by Molotov was very skilfully s t out. from his   speech it seems to the writer clear that the main   aim of the reform was to strengthen and build up   the Soviet state. Reading that speech in Leningrad   I felt that the Russians were taking a leaf out of   our own book and endeavouring to give the Independant   Republics a Dominion status such as has been given   to the jominions which constitute the British Empire.   Molotov's speech is well worth reading in full.   On the 2nd February at the Astoria Hotel Leningrad there were about twelve people in my room after the theatre. The subject of the Constitu tional changes was the main and almost the only topic of conversation between 9 p.m. and. the curfew hour of 1 a.nu I found that the majority of the mixed company present had more than an idea about the Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. That fact interested me. It proved the Constitution is beginning to mean something to the Russians The reason is that the Russians particularly the children are being taught    possibly forced would be a better expression to   learn the Articles of the fundamental Is.w of the   U.S'.S.R. and to appreciate what they mean.   Constitution Day -the 5th December every year is a public holiday. For some weeks before that all the schools devote special attention to instructing the youn in its articles.   The Constitution. Today except for administrative purposes it is a dead letter as dead as rights enjoyed by the citizen of Great Britain in war time. 18B and other clauses abrogate so many of these.   I believe that within ten years the Constitution as set out in 1936 will be the Fundamental Law by which IJ.S.S.R. will be governed.   Two illustrations in support of this -   Case A. A woman about 36 met during my return visit from Leningrad had been refused permission to visit her son who had been stricken down with bone consumption during the two years of his evacuation in Siberia. she would not take no for an answer and finally decided to go to see her local member of the Soviets Working Peoples Deputies. She put her case ho was able through the proper channels to get her permission to visit her son.   On enquiry I learnt that lots of people went to see the Deputies over their problems. These must devote about two hours per day to constituents. Ho had so many on his waiting list that she had to wait 18 days before she could get her interview.   Cass B. A woman in Moscow had a lodging. One room wTth the use of a communal kitchen . This had been badly damaged by bombing in 1942. She had no means of getting the room repaired she met others who lived in a room that was not convenient   for.../, 6   for thorn Sho had wood for heating. They had none. So an exchange was arranged. The house coramitoes concerned and the two regional housing authorities in Moscow refused to give permission for the exchange of lodgings. The woman waited 5 days to interview her local deputy. Then the matter was adjusted satisfactorily. These cases   are going on all over U.S.S.R. sometimes with success sometimes with utter failure like the   fate any ordinary British citizen's plea may meet   from his local M.r    c Soviet Public Opinion Foreign Affairs Public opinion as such does not exist. For 25 years foreign affairs have been a taboo subject. Any opinions Soviet citizens may have about foreign affairs are gained from the official press. In direct opposition to the Russian att3 bude over home affairs they are timorous concerning foreign matters. what the official press publishes they read digest but are most loath to comment upon. It is dangerous. Yes too dangerous even today.   T1 e average Russian has no opinion on the conduct of foreign affairs and never sees the other side of any question.   I venture to suggest that even the German public is better informed on the conditions of Great Britain America the Dominions China Japan and Sweden than the Russian public. They simply have no idea.   The Britanski Souzniki does its best and it is becoming more competent in its task and more widely read to give the Russians some idea of what is being done in our Empire. But if the Britanski Souzniki is read by 200 000 people who per force keep mum about what they have read what is that in a population of 160 million   The Russians are most difficult people to enlighten on the subject of affairs in other countries. For 26 years they have lived in a vacuum. Everything foreign has been cried down. When one tells them as I have done over and over again that bread and potatoes are not rationed in Great Britain they do not call me a liar but politely refuse to believe me. A constant question put to me is Do women work in your country . I know what the womanhood of Great Britain would reply to that question .   Some Dotes on Russian Public Opinion to Forelgn Misslons.   The Polos. Despite all the viciousness of the Soviet press against the Polish Government in London there is no deep em.dty in the heart of the average Russian towards the Polos. As proof I cite the presence of the Polish Force operating in Russia. One meets them everywhere. They are   in Polish uniforms as striking and characteristic as one sees   in London they go about their business without let or   hindrance. Cars attached to the Polish Legion fly Polish   flags. In the Moscow trams Poles travel talking Polish.   I have not found any re-action to the people for being Poles.   The Free French. Sqn. Normandie . These ever increasing fighter pilots are popular in Russia. They are completely Russian maintained and fly Russian planes. They get the same leave as Russian pilots and are liked and respected in the towns to which they go on leave.   The . ./,    7   The Csecha. Of all the foreign representatives at present in U.sTs.R. those are the raost popular. Most Russians know that they fought extremely well ufc the front  Tne Czechs are full of praise for the support that they have received from Rtissian artillery. tank and air cover in operations.   fhe Other Side of the Picture. One of the most difficult things for a BritisE or American resident in U.S.S.R. is to stomach the utter unappreciation of the Allied effort in the common war aim. It is so ungenerous so despicably mean and to the writer s mind so stupid. The only comfort comes when one appreciates that the Russian press -the Pravda the Isvestia the Red Star the 'War and the Working Class are written primarily for the consumption of the Russians. That is to strengthen the resistance in Russia and not to affront thoir co-belligerents for between U.S.S.R. on the one part and the British Empire and U.S.A. 'on the other we arc far from being allies    i Severing of Public Relations with Polish Government in London. This heading has not been dealt with in this resume except for the brief mention of the re-action of the Russians towards the Polish nationals in uniform in U.S S R. for the reason that it is still in the melting pot. But there is no doubt that the severing of diplomatic relations will affect the average Russian citizen. It is the most dangerous matter that stands in the way of an understanding between the East U.S.S.R. and the Western Hemisphere. One can only pray that there is yet time to find a solution    ii The Dissolution of the Comintern. Travelling backwards and forwards from U.S.S.R. via the Southern route which includes Persia Egypt sometimes Africa at others Gibraltar and Portugal one constantly hears about the devilish clevernoss of the Russians in dissolving the Comintern. Some people advance the theory that of course the Comintern has in fact not been suppressed or if it has the Government has found a much better medium as a nationalweapon. That medium is said to be the Communist Movement in all the occupied countries. The movement of Tito in Yugoslavia the left movement in Greece the ruthless war of the people of the left in occupied France and in particular tne avowed Communists in faris are making to resist the invader. Tne writer has made strenuous endeavour to link direct or indiroct guidance in such movements with-h occ ov . He has constantly enquired  Does it really exist and what is the proof of its existence To these queries ho has had no satis factory or conclusive reply.   It is evident that those with left views are today resisting enemy occupation with greater vigour than those of the right or those who subscribe to no party.   Thinking back over the historic years of 1860-1910 there was in the world of politics on the part of   various.../, -8'   various backward and politically muzzled nations an aim toward a British Parliamentary system. It is perhaps the fashion today among the very politically conscious elements in Europe to set their target for a Communist or very left form of order as an ideal. If this theory has any truth its dangers are very apparent but they are dangers to be faced rather than to be regarded with horror and fear.   It seems to the writer that there is so much good and strength both in the British Empire and U.S.A. that whatever new tendencies may be shaping in occupied countries a solution can and should be found and in that finding lies the secret of helping the Russians who are just coming to political consciousness to work out their own salvation which Is so inevitably bound up with the rest of the world.

A.T .   n connection with the attached Memorandum on Leningrad   u. nk the following details omitted from the general text   are of Interest    1 On 27th January I asked General OSSIi'OV to have my passport endorsed with alier-retour visas as I expected to leave for G.K. by direct air service on 30th January  2 Two hours later. General OSSIPOV informed me that a special trip was being organised for me to visit Leningrad and cer tain frontal areas. General OSSIPOV asked whether. In view of this I was prepared to cancel my departure for il.K. I agreed to do   /   so. My passport was sent back unendorsed.   1 confess that this I.il.V.D. invitation came as a complete surprise. Of course for months past on every possible occasion I have urged to be allowed to visit    a partisans in the field or  b areas of operatic but I had almost given up hope of being allowed to do so.  3 The Invitation was most remarkable in view of the fact that no one of the British Military Mission has been allowed any where near the front since General MARTELL first took over about nine months ago. The Americans Generals DEASK GOWMOLLY and SPALDING did visit Kiev In December and the two latter spent two days in Leningrad on 30th/31st December i.e. well before the Russians launched their offensive on 15th January last.   Further the allied journalists in Moscow only went to Leningrad some eleven days after my own visit.    4 I have endeavoured to analyse why the invitation was given. I put forward the following reasons  a N.K.V.D. have been very appreciative of 8.G.E.'s recent  Teenwrit-f, -2exeellont service in connection with certain travel arrangements.  to Improved Brltish-Soviet relationship since Moscow and Teheran.  c British Govermaent s initiative in pressing Soviet Government to send a Military Mission to Yugoslavia.  d The long-term policy SAM has followed in U.S.S.R. for over two and a half years.  5 I travelled as the guest of the M.&.V.D. and at the expense of the Russian Government. I asked if I might take one of my staff with me but this request was politely refused on the score of various technical difficulties.  6 I was accompanied throughout the tour by Senior Lieutenant KHOZMOV of the State Security Service a senior security branch of the W.K.V.D. . He wore uniform he was brought to my headquarters by Colonel GRA'UR and introduced in the most formal manner.  7 At Leningrad we were joined by Reserve Captain .KLIMOV a partisan leader who up to last December commanded four battalions of partisans on the Leningrad-Pskov front behind the German lines. He was in muf ti throughout and wore the red partisan stripe in Ms cap.  8 On 2nd February when we were still well east of Kingisepp our car was met by a jeep . This was in charge of a captain two field policemen and a driver. Ihe party stayed with us until w left the area and were well on our way back to Leningrad.  9 Tho accompanying officers far from being a hindrance did not once throughout the tour attempt to interfere with any of my many conversations with all sorts of men women and cMldren. I further felt that nowhere did their presence cow any of the people with whoa I talked.  10 While they never left me when we were out I was allowed to go out in the city alone and my bodyguard waited for me at the hotel.  11 ... /, /   -3   rrh re were no official banquets .

MOST SECRET February 8th 1944 j   Dear Monsieur Dekanosov   I write under Instructions from my Government to inform the Soviet Government that the British authorities have recently been approached by the Roumanian Vice-Consfrl at Istanbul regarding j a proposed military coup d'Etat in Roumania aimed at overthrowing the Antonescu regime In the name of the King. The matter was raised with the British authorities by this Roumanian official as long ago as early in Oatober but although he is a person in whom they have every confidence it was not taken very seriously and was allowed to drop.   2 Now as I have said the matter has been raised with the British authorities again. It has been explained to them that the movement is sponsored by two generals one an Army Corps Commander and the other a Divisional Commander who claim to have the confidence of a group of officers of all ranks who would be ready to execute their orders. Once the movement had begun it is hoped that many other officers would immediately join although the support of several of the leading generals could not be counted upon. The movement claims to have at Its disposal about 500 000 men armed with rifles and Bren guns of Czechoslovak origin and certain captured Soviet equipment including mortars of the Brandt type. On the other hand it is deficient in tanks anti-tank guns   and artillery since the Roumanian army lost most of their 105 and 150 mm. guns at Stalingrad. Furthermore It could apparently only count on individual adherents in the Air Force although once the coup d'Etat had begun It is hoped that many air force units would join and seize German equipment.   3. The generals are said to be anxious that a token British force of some 1 000 to 2 000 parachute troops under the command of a high-ranking officer should be sent to the Eastern Front where upon the generals would give the signal for the coup d'Etat and offer the unconditional surrender of the Roumanian   army to the, Soviet High Command and the British officer as representing the Allied powers. The ftoumanian Colonel wh fc is responsible for the whole movement has stated that he would be glad to receive a British   liaison officer and would also be glad if a wireless transmitter   set and operator could be sent to facilitate communications.   4. The King and Messrs. Maniu Cretzianu and Caranfll are said to be aware of the intention of certain generals to get Roumania out of the war before her army is destroyed but it is being organised in his name. The movement is at present purely military because the generals concerned have lost faith in the possibility of action by the political parties. On the other hand they would apparently be willing to collaborate with any party chosen by the King. 5. At present the whole scheme appears to my government to be in an embryonic stage and not very promising of success. In particular the figure of 500 000 men to be employed in bringing about the coup d'etat seems to them greatly exaggerated. Moreover it appears to them unlikely that the Germans would allot a specific sector of the front to the Roumanian forces as the proposed arrangements for the surrender of the Roumanian army seems to suggest at least until they are even more hard-pressed on the Southern Front than is already the case. The scheme also appears to have left out of account the reactions of the Germans to the coup d'Etat and the possibility of counter-action by Marshal Antonescu and the forces remaining loyal to him. Finally arrange ments for the despatch of the of the British token force small though it is could only be made if the British authorities were satisfied that the operation was of the highest importance.   6. In spite of its numerous weaknesses my government conside however that the Soviet Government should be informed that the scheme has been put forward and they would be grateful to learn the views of the Soviet Government upon what action if any should now be taken. Meanwhile the British authorities will take no initiative in the matter beyond trying to establish direct wireless contact with the group.   Yrs. sincerely.    Sgd. A.CLARK KERR, H  -r-t  27 MAR fl  DH109/R0/1396/3 26th March 1944.  To AD/S41 Prom D/H109  C.D. AD/H K/Pol W have just received from the Foreign Office copy of a note sent on P bruary 8th 1944 by  H.M. Ambassador in Moscow to M. Dekanosov in regard to the so-called Black Scheme. A copy thereof is attached for your infor mation. We have no indication as to whether any reply was ever received from the Russians to this demarche.  The circulation of this paper is being made as it provides a useful background to recent approaches by Mimi whom we believe to be synonymous or closely connected with the Black Scheme ., I return the papers herewith together with a copy of a minute which I have sent to thd Minister and its enclosure.   3.4.44  Mr. Gann' rookes   1 -RPR 194  sr    395 Wt 10822/2166 1 800 000 4/43 JC&SLtd Gp736/208    REaiMEAN   3-33 -0, I attach as requested a note of comparative scales of food rations in U.S.3.R. U.K. Germany and Belgium.   3.4.44 The Minister %, COMFARATIVB SCALES OP POOD RATIONS IN U.S.3.R.. U.K.. GERMANY AND BELGIUM.   If attention is restricted solely to those foodstuffs which are rationed in the U.S.S.R. the comparative position in the four countries for broadly similar consumer categories is as set out in the attached table. When these rations are   ' .'iv.. .   expressed in terms of calories per day the comparable position is as follows Calories -per day   U.S.S.R. U.K. Cemanv Belgium Very heavy workers Manual 1 Manual 2 Light workers 3100 2250 2000 1500 No official 3100 figures available 2350 from Ministry of Pood. 1600/1950 2550 1700 1150/1450 Children 0-11 years 1000 1 200/1750 1150/1500 Dependants 950 1600   Normal consumer category which includes adult dependants. In order to provide a fully comparative statement of the estimated food consumption of the several categories it is necessary to take account of additional foodstuffs consumed eithep on or off the ration of which the chief are milk potatoes vegetables eggs and fruit. In the U.K. Germany and Belgium milk eggs and cheese are rationed whilst potatoes are rationed in Germany and Belgium. The amount of unrationed food available at controlled prices in the U.K. is virtually unlimited in respect of principal foodstuffs such as bread potatoes oatmeal and vegetables which thus permits differential consumption according to need. In U.S.S.R. additional rationed and unrationed foods are available at controlled prices to privileged categories which include inter alia children and nursing mothers. Consumptives get additional rations. Whilst on the one hand factory workers government employees and soldiers families entitled to register with special shops receive food wh se total   t   calorific value exceeds that of their nominal rations unfavoured households do not always get their nominal rations except for bread When reasonable allowances have been made for food intake additional to that derived from the rations dealt with in para. 1, N  above the comparative position appears as follows Calories -per day   U.S.S.R. U.K. .Germany Belgium Very heavy workers 3350 Adequate 3500 3150 calorie Manual 1 2500 intake can 2750 2350 be obtained Manual 2 2250 by resort to 2000/2350 1550/1800 Light workers 1750 unration- ed foods. Children 0-11 years 1300 1850/2100 1 650/1950  Dependants 1000 2000 1500    Normal consumer which includes adult dependants. The estimated additions to rations included in the above table are tentative especially for the U.S.S.S. Further the categories in U.S.S.R. Germany and Belgium are only broadly comparable. h. Conclusions. The foodstuffs available to Russian categories are certainly much less than those available in this country where broadly speaking needs can always be met from potatoes bread and vegetables. In respect of very heavy and heavy workers categories the U.S.S.R. compares not too unfavourably with Germany and favourably with Belgium. Light workers do not fare quite so well in the U.S.S.R. as in Germany but substantially better than in Belgium. Children who get milk and/or school meals in the U.S.i L appear to get much less than in Germany but since they are more numerous in the U.S.S.R. there iw room for some food redistribution within the family between those very young and those requiring more. Further whatever the precise calorific figure children in the U.S.S.R. are usually reported to appear fit.   Dependants in the U.S.S.R. -this category includes the aged and infirm -fare badly and their lot is one of extreme hardship except in so far as they may benefit from workers      and children s rations., Copy cipher telegram from Moscow No. 1507   MOST SECRET   Following for C.D. Personal. Decipher yourself from Brigadier Hill   1. In return to Moscow after an absence of 50 days I sense that on the highest level the harmony obtained by the Allies at Tehran on matters of general policy has somewhat diminished. The deterioration is to a greater degree than an optimist such as myself had allowed for last December when viewing the future and knowing full well that everything would not remain as sweet as it then seemed. 2. The Polish question Italian shipping controversy etc. are responsible for this. There is a further important factor -Russian nerves. These are stretched to the limit and very much on edge. The Russians know what military risks they have been taking and at what a cost brilliant as are their successes they must now have time to reorganise their forces and consolidate their gains. To do so successfully they must for the next few months depend on Allied action in the west. 3 Despite the above things could be much worse. So far the Russians have been reasonable over Rumania. They manifest in other ways their desire to behave as a major power and to keep as much as possible to the understanding reached at Moscow and Tehran conferences.   4. The last two and a half years have clearly demonstrated that any change -for better or for worse in the degree of understanding betv/een the British and Soviet authorities on the highest level invariably affects Sam's relationship with N.K.V.D. The present deterioration at the top is being reflected on our level. /but, but this time it is not quite so marked The reasons for this I submit are as follows    a Service S.O.E. has rendered N.K.V.D. since December 19U3 in transportation of Pickaxes.  b Pickaxes S.O.E. arranged for Prance and Italy.  c Facilities and arrangements S.O.E. have made for Major Krassowski.  d Overriding all these is the way the Russian Military Mission to Tito was handled by S.O.E.'s representatives in Cairo and sent via Italy to destination and the degree of co-operation the Russians have reported to exist between S.O.E. and Tito. For these two facts S.O.E. is really respected by N.K.V.D. v/hich is inclined to show a greater disposition to collaborate than at any time since 1941. 5. Principal obstacles to such a happy development  apart from the reason given in paragraph 3 I think are after prolonged discussion and argument with my Soviet colleagues as follows  a Vermehren case.  b N.K.V.D. suspicious of British activities from Sweden and in conjunction with Swedish into Latvia Estonia and Lithuania.  ci Bhagat Ram matter.  d Cairo's tendency to urge the Russians for co-operation over action in Bulgaria. It may be helpful for the sake of our future interests to examine points separately /and, and at some length for if these obstacles are capable of adjustment co-operation of N.K.V.D may result on many German and Balkan particularly Roumanian Hungarian and Bulgarian and subsequently Par Eastern questions.   6. Vermehren Case. A. Contents of Foreign Office telegram 597 of March 4th to Moscow was duly communicated to Molotov but this was after story had broken sensationally in world's Press and after Colonel Chichaev had asked that his organisation should have sight of Vermehren's statements. . In particular they wished for such information as impinged in any 'Way on the solution of German-Turkish exchange of intelligence concerning the Red Array and any matters appertaining to espionage on Turkish-Soviet frontier. This request was passed to C. C's organisation in due course stated that Vermehren had not dealt with Russian intelligence and that no information concerning Vermehren's statement could be passed to N.K.V.D. In this communication the name of the German official in Turkey who dealt with Russian was given but S.O.E. were instructed not to pass this to N.K.V.D. This agreement has of course been observed. Colonel Chichaev on being infomed on the morning of my departure expressed keen disappointment and regret. I was so impressed by his sincerity that I ventured to telegraph from Cairo urging that C should be asked to reconsider the matter but C remained adamant. B.-On ray return General Ossipov did not refer to this subject in any way at our first conversation. He waited until I was stressing the importance to the joint war effort of receiving prompt reply from N.K.V.D. to questions asked which are of operational importance and need for close qollaboration between our respective organisations in the Balkan field of operations.  But you are not sincere in desiring such co-operation General Ossipov observed bitterly. And then out came.Vermehren. He   twice grp. mut. candidly that he did not require this   /information, information for his own section but for a sister or brother one. At times he had to go to these organisations to get a reply to 8.O.E.fs questions. How could he do so if there was no give and take from our side   While Vermehren's statement may be so unimportant as not to   warrant all this fuss -or of such importance that to give it to   the Russians would cause international complications -I cannot   help feeling that the Russians have a case a good case against   our readiness to co-operate and a case against us for withholding   intelligence which may be of value to them.   If it is inexpedient for political reasons to give complete   report of Vermehren deposition surely it would be possible and   worth while to prepare a special one but such a doctored   version would have to be a clever one and meaty.   I have discussed this with who is telegraphing to   C. and I feel it would be worth while complying with N'.K.V.D. request. We make the following suggestions a That I should give the information to General Ossipov or  b That should give it to his contact and that I should tell Ossipov he was doing so or  c That he and I should give it to our respective contacts and at the same time inform them of procedure adopted. and I feel that paragraph c is probably the best course and could not harm our respective channels.. Please show C this series of telegrams. In the event of a favourable decision it is important that information should be telegraphed and not sent by bag.   7. N.K.V.D. s alleged suspicion of S.O.E. activity from Sweden into Baltic States. A. Following his Vermehren protest Ossipov made the above allegation. He asked me if I considered this stressed a genuine desire for co-operation on our part and stressed clauses /concerning   i ISACOPY 1 f, concerning these territories in our Charter.   B. I replied that. I. had no knowledge of any such activity and considered it most unlikely particularly so in view of the fact that I had discussed with colleagues in London the fate of the British agent we had dropped with Russian consent in Estonia and had had discussions with Sir George Binney concerning possible activities in the Baltic on which matter I was awaiting further instructions. C. In view of clauses in 3.0.E.-N.K.V.D. Charter I find it difficult to imagine that S.O.E. carf have instituted directly or indirectly any form of activity in these territories without instructing Hill to tell Russians it was proposed to do so. It would hardly be v/orth while instituting any activity without informing grp. mut. for it is obvious that it would be limited to the time when the Red Army re-occupied these territories. Further if one did so it would almost certainly be discovered by the Russians and so estrange them as to make such action a folly.   D. Of course C may have set up an organisation. That would be quite another matter. E. If by some evil chance S.O.E. has been or is operating as alleged submit best course is to retrocede clause quickly to N.K.V.D. F. I promised Ossipov I would report his allegations and ask for your observations. Grateful for your urgent reply. 8. Bhagat Ram matter. This is an old sore. The latest position is that on December 20th 1943 N.K.V.D requested in writing that Bhagat should return to Kabul forthwith. They reiterated their request on February 29th. On March 8th N.K.V.D. were informed that this was agreed and that Bhagat's departure would follow. On April 3rd at the request of N.K.V.D. we again asked for this information. Only on the evening of April 12th was a reply received.

Therefore they are unwilling to co-operate with us at present. Unless the matter is of sufficient importance to raise on highest level I consider we had better let it drop until a more favourable time.

I took Colonel Chichaev out last night to the theatre and afterwards treated him to a dinner. A considerable quantity of liquor was consumed which is very unusual for Chichaev. He was very reserved at the beginning but looqened up after the third cocktail. The following were his mutterings    The question of visae is a mere detail much larger issues are involved. After all I fail to see the purpose of having a mission of four men representing your organisation in Moscow v/hile I myself manage to fulfil the same functions very well and am practically idle the whole day. Your mission is suposed to represent an active body -can you please tell me what action there is which necessitates the Brigadier having so many assistants On the whole we are most dissatisfied with the three years of our cooperation with your organisation. There was a time when we needed you and needed you badly the results hov/ever were very poor. I admit that about thirty agents were dropped by you at our request but their effective ness has been in most ca.ses reduced tp nil due to the delays   in their despatch. I admit that there were difficulties very often the weather was against us but we are at war and the risks had to be taken. We were quite prepared to risk the lives of our men and a similar risk should have been taken by you with regard-to planes crews etc. We had great plans when our association was inaugurated. We hoped that a heavy traffic in agents and materials would take place. The neces sity for it has now passed. We are doing very /ell without it the Red Army sees to it. At the time when we needed you you never put forward before us any concrete plans in which we could assist you. Now it is too late.   / I naturally,  I Eraturally reacted to his remarks in a jocular though somewhat violent manner and helieving that attack is the best form of defence accused his organisation of disappointing us in more than one way although as he has admitted he did not get much change out of me he concluded his remarks by a rather cynical statement obviously implying an analogy between our relations with the N.K.V.D. and those between Russia and Japan  There was a time when Japan could get anything from us that they wanted v/hen we were weak and we had to give in read our new agreement with Japan and you will see the difference.   I mentioned to him emphasising that I was expressing my own opinion that the Balkan situation would now give the   N.K.V.D. ample opportunity to reciprocate our assistance to them meagre as it had been to help us to infiltrate bodies into Roumania Bulgaria etc. His answer was a very curt one  What for We shall get all we need in the Balkan countries without your agents being infiltrated., a6 ftPRia    3   TO S.O.

I have a shrewd suspicion that these rather pet ulant remarks represent his real views and prohahly those of his superiors also. I do not think there is any specific action we can take at this juncture hut it is well to hear the Russian attitude in mind., 2 6 APR 1944   COPY TO 3.0. Messages from Colonel de Chastelain received in Cairo on April 22nd.   No. 9 Dated April 19th -   Marshal Antonescu has heen informed of terms hy Maniu. I do not know their reactions hut those officials with whom we are in contact indicate    a Lack of faith in the Soviet  h Impossibility of collaboration between Roumanian and Red Army  c Conviction that placing of lines of comi'nunication at the disposal of the Allies is equivalent to occupation by the  Red Army.    d Disillusion that terms have been made by Soviet and not by the Three Allies with whom Roumania is effectively at war since the air raids began. Although they admit that the German Army is not defending Roumania east of the Carpath ians they consider it dishonourable not to fight the Reds to the end. They do admit that the country wants peace but they are not willing to start a new fight against Germany. They are convinced that Roumania is abandoned to the Soviet as we have lost initiative and    supremacy. They believe the Red Army will not stop before the Bosphorus and the Adriatic. They infer that the attitude would be different if Anglo-American troops approached Roumanian territory.   I hope to have Maniu's reply in a day or so.   No. 10 Dated April 20th -   Re bombing our contacts say that civilians and civil objectives suffered most that anti-Allied feeling and will to resist increased   / as the, as the raids are regarded as an aid to Red Army invasion. Commun ist propaganda .here and Radio Moscow emphasise that the Soviet are not homhing open towns here.   Prom the results seen hy us the only military targets effect ively homibed were the principal Railway Station and the Hotel Splendid Gestapo H.Q. hut on theWhole the homhing was indiscr iminate and terrorist -killing three thoiisand civilians inihie first raid. The Roumanians expected the Allies to homh only military objectives to impede the German war effort and we believe that while disorganisation and civilian losses qf terrorist raids iner e the desire for peace the homhing of military targets would give   better general results.,    29th April 1944.   F/85   /y- To 3.0 From AD/S.l   Relations with N.K.V.D.   We seem to be running into a period of strained relations with our Russian Allies. Apart from the general distrust evidenced in the record of Manderstam's conversation with Chichaev copy of which I showed you yesterday we are having trouble with them over the sending of joint O.S.S./S-O.E. parties into Rouraania. Ossipov in conversation with Hill last week reproached us for not asking N.K.V.D. to participate in these operations. This put us in a difficult position. The chances of our parties securing valuable contacts with the Roumanians would be seriously weakened by the inclusion of Russians in the party owing to the Roumanians intense and apparently increasing distrust of the U.3.S.R. of which a further evidence is seen in de Chastelain's latest telegram copy of which I attach. At the same time it is clearly desirable to collaborate with N.K.V.D.. if it is conceivably possible and it is almost essential for our O.S.S./S.O.E. parties to be provided with a letter of introduction from the Russians for use when they contact the advancing Red Army soldiers who are quick on the draw .  Ossipov's hurt feelings are certainly not   sincere because we have information from most secret   sources of continuous and widespread penetration of all   the Balkan countries by N.K.V.D. who have never asked   us to collaborate in these activities. However we have   at least temporarily solved our difficulties by affirming   that we shall welcome the attachment of Russian officers   to the six groups as soon as these officers are available   /to, to join but that we cannot hold up the despatch of our Missions and the Russian officers must follow in due course. This will give us an opportunity to make contact with the Roumanians without the embarrassment of Russians in the party though I cannot help thinking the Roumanians would be seriously disquieted if and when the Russians did arrive., To 3.0. Prom AD/S.l   V . uw 13th May 1944   The accompanying Confidential Annex reached rne this morning with a covering note from Sir Edward Bridges which I also attach and which speaks for itself.   You have already seen telegram No. 1185 from Moscow to the Foreign Office which concerns this lamentable business but I attach this also for reference. We have only just been able to persuade the Foreign Office to let us have a copy of Molotov's message to the Prime Minister which is contained in telegram No. 1310 from the Foreign Office to Moscow and. 'which is included in this dossier Orme Sargent has told V/CD quite definitely that we cannot have a copy of the Prime Minister's reply. On the other hand Cadogan has agreed to our having a copy of Molotov's further reply subject to the approval of Downing Street. I have spoken to Bridges' secretary and he thinks he v/ill be able to get this approval and will send me a copy immediately. I hope to have this by Monday morning.   I would also refer you to the general telegrams about the Greek situation in this box . You will remember that the suggestion has already been made by Deeper that the Soviet are trying to find a good excuse for sending a Russian Mission to EAM. This has been reinforced by the probability that a directive has been given to the Soviet Press to play up EAM and criticise the new Government and I think it is quite likely that the Foreign Secretary's suggestion is true that the real object of Molotov's complaint about Rumania is in fact a desire to find such an excuse.   v  M, I enclose for your Minister's information a copy of a Confidential Annex of a discussion which took place last night in the War Cabinet about Russia and Roumania. I send it to him because as he will see S.O.E. activities are referred to.   Perhaps you would be good enough to tell your Minister that this matter was not down on the agenda for discussion. Indeed I had not seen the incoming telegram from M. Molotov of the 10th May which gave rise to the discussion and I did not know the matter was going to be raised until the Prime Minister referred to it at the meeting.   V.M. Cannon Brookes Esq. Ministry of Economic Warfare, C.D. Erjtilft AD/S.l. has shown me the various telegrams passing botween London and Moscow concerning    1 The C.Q.S. Directive to S.0.1. to tsice all possible steps with N. to promote better understanding between the Polish Secret Army and the Red Army.  2 The proposal to distract the attention of the Gestapo from the French Resistance Movement in France by false parachute operations to Russian troops serving with the Wermaoht. I agree generally to the proposal that Ossipov should be invited to come to this country ostensibly to discuss with S.O.E. matters of mutual interest. At the same time I do not like.the idea of sending Russians into France with the first or second wave . I imagine however that the time factor would rule out this suggestion and in any event it will be for S.H.A.E.F. to decide after consultation with ourselves and the Foreign Office   1st June. 1944, s   COPY TELEGRAM NO.3537 TO MOSCOW 3rd June 1944.   Your 1587.   1. Suggest you should approach Ossipov and extend invitation to him to visit this country on the lines of paragraph 4 of our telegram No.3515. You should frame invitation to take effect after OVERLORD safely launched.   2. Agree that if Ossipov comes you should accompany him. 3. If Ossipov is anxious to proceed to the Continent you should explain that we cannot give him any assurance as S.H.A.E.F. s decision would he required. We would .however he willing to put him in touch with right people in S.H.A.E.F. and try to obtain favourable decision for him.   4. As additional reasons for Ossipov s visit you might stress .following a -Operational S.O.E./S.O. and N.K.V.D.  b Exchange of views on action in Germany both before and after German capitulation.  c Opportunity to study our relations with Continental Resistance after D-Day. 5. Donovan is now in this country and I assume he will not leave till after OVERLORD. Do not know how long he will stay here after that but possibility of his being in Lond on might prove an additional inducement to Ossipov to come here., G.400/5 19th June 1944. TO AE PROM G.400   I enclose herewith the Foreign Office paper on Probable Post-War Tendencies in Soviet Foreign Policy as Affecting British Interests which is very interesting indeed. It is gratifying to see that the main conclusions coincide with the observa tions made by an expert on Russia who is now on the spot namely the Canadian Ambassador in Moscow - Mr. Dana WILGRESS.   In connection herewith may I draw your attention to my report S0/706 of the 2nd May 1944 to which I referred during our conversation this morning.   I also enclose a memorandum on the same subject prepared by the Deparfernent of External Affairs in Canada which you might find of interest. I have had this circulated in the office.   Yours sincerely.   a,  Copy   LBX/446 27 Jun 44   SECRET   To A/CD From L/BX   WAR CRIMINALS.   1. War criminals are taken here as including not only officers of the SS and Wehrmacht on the Black Lists of Allied Governments hut the leading lights of the Nazi Party. They might well include certain Nazi industrialists scientists and engineers. 2. It may be assumed that a German request for an armistice will be simultaneously accompanied if indeed not shortly preceded by the flight of the war criminals by air by sea and where still feasible by land. 3. Neutral parts which war criminals may make South America in particular Argentina Turkey and Sweden. The position of Turkey or Sweden offers certain disadvantages as a place of permanent refuge and outh America is therefore more likely to be the asylum which the Nazis will choose not only to escape the vengeance of the Allies but as a starting point from which to prepare for World War III. 4. Of the three means of flight -air sea and first-named is the means likely to be chosen in most cases since the submarine alone offers prospects of escape by sea and the chaotic conditions which may well prevail in France at the time of the crack-up will preclude flight by road or rail to the Peninsula en route for South America . 5. The exaggerated respect hitherto paid by the rights of neutral States must inevitably facilitate the escape of war criminals since it is most unlikely that these states will waive the right of political refugees to asylum. Interception of aircraft carrying the war criminals will therefore only be possible over the Atlantic between the Peninsula and the South American Continent. 6. By posting agents at all landing grounds aircraft unarmed Mosquitos say at all airfields in the Peninsula it should be possible to follow the flight of War Criminals and signal Allied fighters in the Azores the north west and west coasts of Africa to intercept enemy or neutral aircraft used for escape and force them down into the sea or on to Allied landing grounds. 7. S.O.S. might render valuable service to the Forces in a scheme of this kind as agents if not as saboteurs.  Sgd. H.D.C, , K.

The Ambassador s name is Mr. Dana Wilgress The covering note to the despatches was Yjritten   i  by Mr. Halpern.   I think it is worthwhile your reading all the despatches as the Ambassador brings a very fresh mind on to the Russian problem and gives his views on future Soviet policy from an angle which is not perhaps adequately appreciated.   The main thesis of his arguments is that if Rpssia can be persuaded to have trust in the Western Powers she will not adopt an aggressive international policy., To S.O. From AD/S.1.   p. 85. 50th June 1944. Halpern who is coming to see you this a tc-rrrtTrm is Stephenson's expert in his New York office on European and Russian affairs. He is I believe a V/hite Russian in origin but is a British citizen and practices at the Bar at Grays Inn in peace-time .   His particular interests are the post-v/ar   treatment of Germany and Russia's position in the post-war world. The attached note by him covering despatches from Wilgress the Canadian Ambassador in Moscow to his Department have been sent up to you by C .D. but you have not yet had the opportunity   of reading them. They are very interesting and   emphasise in particular that Russia will play her part as a great power in the world in collaboration with the United Nations provided that she is convinced by our actions that we are not going to   allow Germany to menace Europe and Russia again., No. 2426   D. 7.50 p.m.. 17th July 1944 17th July 1944 Repeated to Resrain Med No. 1564   Tehran No 427 Moscow No. 2140 I I I I I MOST IMMEDIATE My telegram No. 2329 [of 8th July Russian prisoners.]  Sovie-t Embassy have asked on instructions for explanation of a report received in Moscow from Soviet authorities in Cairo that 2 006 Russian prisoners of war selected by General Sudakov for repatriation to the Soviet Union are being held up by British authorities in Egypt pending discussions with the Soviet Government.

REPORT ON TREATMENT OF A RED ARMY OFFICER WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER BY THE GERMANS AND HAD BEEN FORCED TO WORK FOR THEM   On Sunday evening 16th July at the Datcha rented for the Mission a junior officer aged 30 made his appearance. This officer is the adopted son of the owners and his sister aged 21 who Is also adopted and is married to a Red Army soldier lives there as well. The family had had no news of their son for 3 years and had given him-up as lost.   Early next morning before we returned to Moscow Captain Wild learnt that the officer had been a 'prisoner of war that he had been in a Gestapo camp in 1941 and that he had worked for the Germans and had done some very very odd things. Unfortunately it was impossible to talk to the officer than . owing to appointments in Moscow. However he was interviewed on his return to the Datcha on Sunday night 23rd July by which time his family had concluded that he would not be back.   The following information is made up from this officer's own statement and what I learnt from his sitter and adopted parents    a He graduated as an electrical engineer In 1936. He had been a Komsomoletz and in 1938 had been registered as a candidate for Party membership Communist Party B .  b He had served in the Red Army for a year in 1937 and for a period of 3 months as a specialist in the Signal Corps during the years 1938/9. He v/as mobilised into the Signal Corps on the outbreak of war with Germany and was promoted to the rank of Junior Lieutenant being drafted to a mobile telephone and W/T Section.  c He was taken prisoner in September 1941.  d For a short time he was fairly well fed and accommo dated then he was transferred to a new camp where he was scientifically treated in the manner described in the memorandum from London DP/RU/2121 dated June 1944. The treatment was terrible but not as bad as that meted out to the civilian population.  e After 'treatment' in December 1941 the prisoner was offered work in a factory. He accepted for the sole reason that it was the best means of escape. He concealed his know ledge of signals and electricity though admitting some training as a mechanical engineer and he was drafted to a sugar refinery south of Kiev.  f Here he worked hard in order to gain confidence of the German management. There was many other Soviet citizens at the refinery -some as drudges some like himself with an ulterior purpose.  g He made friends with a co-worker and after a time confided to him that his purpose was one of escape. No you don't said his confidant You will stay here and work and I will show you how I've been sent by Moscow to do so. From then on there started real sabotage.' What hap pened to that sugar refinery was just nobody&s business but it did go on producing sugar to the satisfaction of the German management.    h Three times during the following years the officer was suspect. On the last occasion he was arrested by the Gestapo., -2- The German management intervened and said the man was the best influence in the refinery that they had absolute confidence in his integrity and that they must have him back. And back he went.  i The officer stated that from February 1942 they had full information of what was happening in Moscow. This came from w/T illicit news sheets and parachute leaflets. He worked a W/T set and demolished the Kiev telephone communi cations.  j From September 1942 Vlassov agents were always in and out of factories such as his doing propaganda with the workers. Vlassov he says is a very well known name to all prisoners -but only a name.  k Then Kiev was about to fall he was offered sanctuary in Germany by his German masters. He refused on the plea that he had not seen his family for three years and had to go back. This was accepted by the director of the factory and for his good work he was allowed to stay behind when the management evacuated.  l On the eniry of the Red Army he was ordered to remain at his post. The Russian who had set him his tasks made full reports on him and everyone at the factory. There -was an infinitesimal number of traitors. Some had not been good but circumstances were taken into consideration. He knew of five who had been shot as traitors. There were 540 employed at the refinery or on its payroll. Some cases were still being examined. He was unable to communicate with his home. He stayed at his job until the 20th June when he was relieved by a  professional'1 refinery expert. He was ordered to report to a Moscow base unit and to return to signal duties.  m On arrival in Moscow he was kept for a week during which time he was cross-examined medically examined issued with new.identity documents uniform and epaulettes and given 5 days' leave. This leave had expired on 21st July. He returned to his base unit and was given a further 24 hours' leave v hich expired on 24th July at midday. He expects to be drafted immediately on his return for active service. He is treated by the Red Army as a man who has done his duty and by his family as a hero.  n During the conversation he made the following interes ting observations In any future wars in the officer's opinion no one should be a combattant under the age.of 23. The young should be kept at home and trained for citizenship.  o The bulk of the civilian population -who were not politically minded -were a good target for German propa ganda. They were l terribly bamboozled by the German propaganda and 2 treated worse than beasts when the Nazis had them in their power. jjp The Germans promised much which attracted very many but after a year of living under the Nazi machine most of such people were disillusioned.  The hatred of the Germans in the Ukraine is like white hot steel.  r White Russians on the whole ments bettwr than the Ukrainians. withstood German blandish  s . .. /, -3    s His factory managed to send about 3% of its sugar to the partisans by careful rigging of the scales. He con sidered this an excellent percentage.  t Shortly before the recapture of Kiev the Germans were obviously trying to curry favour with Russians such as him self and constantly said in an anxious fashions You do admit we have treated you well. Two days later recounting part of the above story a Russian woman at the party said that her bcother returned from Minsk only last week. Captured in 1941 he took service almost immediately under the Germans as an engineer and ran the Sauerkraut factory until 4 weeks before the Soviet Army recaptured the town. He received warning and took to the woods.   Early in 1942 powdered glass was freely mixed with the Sauerkraut. In July 1943 a medical commission of the Gestapo visited the factory trying to trace glass. But all went off well and the Russians were not suspected.   During the whole period large quantities of sour cabbage were regularly sent -unmixed with powdered glass -to the partisans.   My informant's brother is on leave and is to be awarded a decoration.   From my talk with the officer mentioned above -a talk which lasted into the dawn -an interesting fact emerged. Our host the owner of the Datcha had been a member of the crew of the cruiser Potemkin in 1905. I had been puzzled as to why this individual owned the Datcha the reason for his uncompromising attitude to so many question his outspoken criticism and his very free outlook on most subjects. The fact that he is a Bolshevik of the old school satisfactorily solves all my per plexities .   oOo., COPY   MOSCOW 26th July 1944.   Dear D/P   I enclose herewith the report on an interview which I had with a Russian ex-prisoner of war.   I think you will find it interesting read in conjunction with your POW report of June 1944 DP/RU/2121.   Yours    sgd. D/P.101., AUG 1944   17th Aug.1944 From AD.4 AD4/2121   I attach a copy of a report received from SAM with his covering notetconcerning the treatment of a Russian soldier who it is alleged. worked for the Germans returned to Moscow and having been well treated is to be given an award.   It is to be noted that this man did not join the German Army and all the reports D/P has made show clearly that the Russian Ps/W. who dread most going back to Russia are very naturally those who have enlisted in the German Army.   I do not think that the report submitted by SAM makes convincing reading. Nevertheless I send it to you and leave it to your discretion as to whether or not you wish to show it to S.O.   There is always the possibility -which has occurred already -that SAM has given a duplicate of this report to the Ambassador who may have sent it to the Foreign Office who may show it to the Secretary of State who may refer it to S.O. This has as I think you know already happened over the report of W/o. Storey., Tdi AD.4 From AD/SW.   F .3001/85 19th August 1944.   ith reference to your AD4/2121 of August 17th I entirely agree that this curious report is not very convincing. S.O. is away on leave until September 4th and we will decide in the meantime whether the report is of sufficient value to stow it to him on his return.   Meanwhile may I suggest that SAM should be instructed to st te clearly whenever he sends reports of this nature whether the original report or a copy of it has been handed to H M.Ambassador. There is of course no guarantee whatever that SAJI will carry out his instructions but we should at any rate have the satisfaction of being able to tell S.O.that suoh instructions have been issued., COPY TOP SECRET MOSCOW lat August 1944.

Now the Polish Emigre Government in London was bankrupt and virtually dead. Unbroken historical continuity might still be preserved and be of great use to Poland and for the saving of face to Britain and America If M. has a plan and is very very careful.   Stalin s readiness to receive M. is a good sign. Pika thinks.    a It is a gesture of goodwill to Britain and U.S.A. and supports Stalin s repeated assertion that he does not wish unduly to meddle in Polish home affairs.  b While Pika personally discounts the strength of the Underground Movement in Poland loyal to the Polish Govex'nment in London it clearly points to the fact that the Russians are ready to go a long way -by treating with M. -to avoid civil war now or in the immediate future. It M. is ready to face actualities a united Polish front -anyway for a time -should be possible. Ihis would be most heartening for Poles serving in other theatres of war. It would give them hope.

I attach herewith a copy of a report from D/P.101 in Moscow which may be of interest to you, COPY TOP SECRET MOSCOW 1st August 1944   Dear Sir Archibald   After I left you this morning 1 had a long talk i lth General Pika. The following are the salient points of our conversation    1 Months ago he and General Svoboda envisaging the situation which has now arisen asked the Russian General Staff to supply arms for the use of the Underground Units in Slovakia so that at the appropriate time they might actively support the two Czech Divisions formed in the U.S.S.R.  2 In principle1 the Soviet Government agreed to help.  3 To arrange for the reception of such arms the Russians dropped on behalf of the Czechs five agents equipped with w/T sets.  4 Four of these have come on the air and given pinpoints in various parts of Slovakia where arms can be dropped.  5 As the Russians were vague as to the actual quantities they would be able to drop and when they could do so. General Pika asked the Czechoslovak authorities in London to ascer tain whether SOE could drop a small specified quantity of arms to Slovakia from the United Kingdom.  6 He has repeatedly pressed the Soviet authorities as to when they proposed to a ct.  7 Quite recently the Russians have asked General Pika to supply details as to whom such arms would be dropped names of those in charge of the Czechoslovak Underground Movement how the arms would be used and what guarantees there were that they would not fall into Czechoslovak Fascist hands.  8 General Pika is of the opinion that if British help is offered on a high level it will greatly help the situation for  a It will galvanise the Russians into action.  b Ihe British supply will ensure that anyway some arms will reach those ready and eager to us them.  9 He very much approves of the suggested procedure outlined in paragraph 5 of the Foreign Office telegram 2329 of 31st July 1944.  10 He stressed the moral value to the Czechoslovak Underground Movement of knowing that they were getting further supplies from the British.  11 General Pika said he would see his Ambassador before he visited you and would leave it to him to decide whether he. General Pika was to accompany him.  12 General Pika showed me on a map the three principal ways in which this Czechoslovak Underground force couM be utilised in forthcoming operations. Hia views have been put.fully to the Soviet general Staff. G.A.H. Brigadier.   Sir Archibald Clark Kerr P.C. G.C.M.G., COPY MOSCOW 1st August 1944.   Dear D/P Herewith copy of memorandum prepared for H.E. concerning      my talk with General Pika on Flying Foxes and his views on the Polish situation which I fully share.      I was present when H.E. received M. PIERLINGER. He did not bring General PIKA with him.   At the interview I got the impression that Fierlinger was not very keen on British help. He took the line that it was purely military matter and one that should be dealt with by General Pika and myself in conjunction with the Russian General Staff. H.E. was however very firm. His instructions he said were specifically to take the matter up with Molotov and that he was writing him to-day. I left before Fierlinger so do not know H.E.'s reactions to the interview. As we are off in the morning it seems too good to be true I will not be able to see H.E. until I return.   I ra afraid I will not be able to leave Moscow until the third week In August -It depends on how long we are going to be away. I do not propose to write my report of this visit In London as I did the Leningrad one . It's too complicated a procedure.   I look forward to seeing you all.

You will remember that with the approval of the Foreign Office an agreement was made between S.O.E. and N.K.V.D. for an exchange of Missions for purposes of liaison in September   1941.   We entered on this arrangement with possibly unduly high hopes as to the extent of co-operation which might be achieved with the N.K.V.D. in various parts of Europe where we were both operating. The actual result has been however that whilst we have carried out certain services for N.K.V.D. in   the way of infiltrating their agents for them into various countries of Western Europe to the number of 25 they have done literally nothing for us.   Many proposals have been put up to them for co-operation on a strictly reciprocal basis in the countries of Eastern Europe in Germany and in the Far East and on quite a number of occasions we have asked for their help in some relatively small matter of intelligence or facilities. The outcome has always been either a definite refusal or a continual post ponement of any reply leading to the eventual dropping of our proposals or requests.   Brigadier Hill's personal relations with his opposite numbers in N.K.V.D. appear to be good -better as far as we can learn than those of most other British representatives in Moscow. The Mission has steadily increased in numbers and in   / cost. Sir Orme Sargent K.C.M.G. C.B. FOREIGN OFFICE S.W.l., 2   cost. Absolutely no indication however has appeared that we are getting anywhere with the N.K.V.D. in the matter of practical co-operation on S.O. work and indeed the impression has grown steadily amongst all of us h ere that the possibilities of achieving results by the method so far tried have virtually disappeared.   Even Brigadier Hill in a recent telegram dated 17th August reporting on a long conversation which he had with his opposite number General Ossipov has begun to express pessimism as to the outcome of his efforts.   In these circumstances we have had to give very careful consideration to the future of the Mission. I have also had the opportunity of discussing the position fully with General Brocas Burrows.   We have come unanimously to the conclusion that from a purely S.O.E. point of view it would be a waste of money time and effort to go on as we are going on now and that if the Mission is to be justified at all some new tactic must be tried with the N.K.V.D.   Left to ourselves we would propose to take the following steps in the conviction that our only chance of getting anything from the Russians which will constitute a dividend on the very considerable expenditure involved in the Mission is to take a firm line with the N.K.V.D. and make it clear that if there is not going to be any practical co-operation we do not wish to carry on with the present pretence. We would instruct Brigadier Hill to advise General Ossipov that we were profoundly disappointed with the complete failure of our liaison with the N.K.V.D. over a period of 3 years to produce any concrete results and that we had virtually lost hope of the exchange of Missions leading to any practical results. Brigadier Hill would inform General Ossipov that he was being recalled to London for consultation and   / would, 3   would indicate that there was little prospect of his returning to Moscow. He would also convey tactfully to General Ossipov that the invitation to visit London which had been extended to him some months ago but about which we have been unable to get any definite reply must now be regarded as having lapsed. In the course of making this communication Brigadier Hill would be instructed to review the position in regard to a number of proposals which have been put by us to N.K.V.D. over the last 6 months indicating the extremely unsatisfactory state of all of them.   On Brigadier Hill's return to London he would be held here indefinitely and any negotiations which we might wish to carry on with N.K.V.D. would be discussed through the N.K.V.D. liaison mission in London under Colonel Chichaev.   The N.K.V.D. might of course retaliate to these tactics by asking us to withdraw the rest of the Mission from Moscow and recalling Colonel Chichaev and the rest of his colleagues from London. In such an event we do not believe that as S.O.E. we would be really any the worse off particularly as General Burrows had indicated that he would be quite prepared to allow us informal representation in his Mission.   On the other hand it is possible that N.K.V.D. will do nothing at all and the situation would simply continue on this basis. Again we feel that we would have saved something and lost nothing.   Finally there is at least a chance that our new tactics might bring N.K.V.D. up with a jolt and that they might think it worth while in due course to make some approach to us particularly if in the meantime they got the impression that we were engaged in extensive activities on the continent and particularly in Germany in regard to which it would be in their interests to work with us.   If S.O.E. alone were concerned I would put the above   / programme, -4   programme into operation without hesitation. I recognise however that the Foreign Office have a double interest in this matter firstly because the relations of S.O.E. with N.K.V.D. may be considered to have some effect upon Anglo-Russian   relations generally and secondly because I know that Brigadier Hill is regarded personally as being of some use to the   Ambassador without whose specific consent my Minister would not wish to withdraw him.   I do not-think that the action proposed by us would in fact be in the least likely to lead to a state of friction between   S.O.E. and N.K.V.D. which could in any way affect Anglo-Russian relations but it is obvious that it would involve a considerable risk of Brigadier Hill s permanent departure from Moscow. .I. therefore feel that we should not begin to execute a definite programme.of this kind without giving the Foreign Office the opportunity to express its views with a full appreciation of the implications which might be involved.   i.

My dear Sporborg   With the present wonderful postal service between Moscow and London -alas a very temporary one -I want to send you a letter which D.V. will reach you in record time. I also feel you may be interested in hearing some gossip and news of Moscow doings.   So far things seem to be going fairly well but I rather doubt if the meeting will stand out as the Moscow and Teheran ones of 1943 do as land marks in Anglo-Soviet relationship. A few niggers have emerged from the woodpile. The best is Tito's unadvertised and not reported recent visit to the Kremlin. Ye Gods what a story.   The Poles arrived last night. They are housed in the Metropole Hotel where the press as usual got at 'em. They replied that Mr. Eden had warned them to say nothing While they had a very quiet reception and a cold Press this morning something may come of their visit. One of the main reasons that may bring this about is that the P.C.P.A. are fully aware of the inexperience of the National Committee.   Wednesday H.E. gave a dinner for 30 at the Embassy. I think it's the first occasion that Stalin has attended an Embassy Banquet in Moscow. Barman who is flourishing Crossthwaite myself and one or two others gave an overflow dinner party to P.0 and Secretary of State's Staff. We were 16 in all. At   10.45 our party and another given by Admiral Arden joined H.E.'s party at the Embassy. The great lamps at the gates of the Embassy were a blaze of light. The brightest lighting I've seen in Moscow in three years l arrived by air three years ago to-day -what a three years . I've never seen so many police as were on duty in the   / streets, 2   streets and on the river there were two armed cutters cruising up and down sweeping the river banks with enormous searchlights and lighting up the battlements of the Kremlin that face the Embassy. A wonderful sight. As we drove up Moscow was firing   a salute.   On either side of the front door two full II.K.V.D. Colonels stood rigidly to attention from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. being relieved every hour .   Inside the Embassy in all the corridors on landings and at all doors there stood guards. Mostly officers but there were a few N.C.O.s in white gloves and very prominently displa j pistols. It v/as not a pleasant sight. I felt no objection to the guards outside but I must say I resented the display in our Embassy. I thought wistfully of Buckingham Palace on a state occasion or Chequers during a weekend   It had been planned that H.E.'s dinner would finish promptly   at 10 50. But it went so well that it did not break up until t p . 12 30 a.m. So about 50 of us stood and waited in the white  drawing room -for there were not many chairs. The first f-of an hour was all right there were drinks and people smoked and chatted quite happily but after that people got rather fidge P and some downright gloomy. The P.M. and Stalin came in looking very cheerful. Both in uniform Stalin without a single decoration or ribbon the P.M. with rows of ribbons. A striking contrast. Stalin drank the company's health. They both walked round chatting for 20 minutes. They then went into the Red Drawing Room where a great log fire was burning followed by Eden Molotov H.E. Harriman Vyshinsky Litvinov Gusiev and Maisky. The doors were closed and the rest of the guests   settled down again to enjoy each other's company. By 2.30 a.m. most the people had drifted away. By 3.30 there v/ere only a   I   few senior Russians members of the Embassy Staff and chaps like myself. God I worked hard translating for various members of   the London party. At 4 a.m. we heard the big boys go off.   / without, 3   without returning to the White Drawing Room I with thankfulness we were all able to go home. It was a frosty morning and I did not envy the wretched police or those on the launches on the river.   Well I think I d better close. I hope you are keeping fit. I cannot understand the policy that is being followed by S.O.E. vis-a-vis SAM in Moscow but I suppose I'll know in due course. Certain things should be clearer by the end of next week so far as high level policy is concerned between the Allies which will probably help one to peep into the future and lay plans. Collaboration in Germany will be most desirable and I think possible and then the matter of the Par East will also be a little clearer.   Greetings to you all.   Yours    Sgd. GEORGE HILL., COPY   Â§   MOSCOW U.S.S.R   ft.I -   TOP SECRET 16th October 1944.   Dear C.D.   The Conference is drawing to a close.   Prom the point of view of getting to know each other its been an undoubted success. The ovation given   to the P.M. and Stalin at the Big Theatre last night was as   great as it was spontaneous and it is obvious that the   two men are now on very friendly terms. Once or twice the   P.M. has seen Stalin alone with only Pavlov -the Russian interpreter -present. This gesture on the P.M.'s part has created a great impression in High Soviet circles. Last night s Military Conference with Antonov Eden went well. The C.I.G-.S. is pleased. Just now everything is easy but I'm very much afraid that wen the Captains and Kings depart 30 Military Mission and we ourselves may find that the general attitude will not be very different to that which existed before this conference. But I am confident that this meeting will make things easier for collaboration between the British and Soviet staffs later and particularly in Berlin. Thats going to be a difficult party.   You will probably be interested in the present Polis r situation which is alas far from being resolved.   Mikolajczyk had a chilly press but the arrival of certain members of the National Committee was not much more heralded. That I feel is a good pointer. The Russians arp tending to let the National Committee -stew. They know that there is not complete unanimity among its members and that they are all very inexperienced. You will have seen that Vitos is already out.   The procedure that was followed here was as follows. The big four with Harriman sitting in saw Mikolajczyk. Rower etc. before dinner. This was a disappointing session. The   /Poles, Poles stated among other things that they did not feel able to discuss frontier lines and repeated old arguments over and over again to the growing impatience of the four. After-dinner the latter saw the National Committee. Prom the opposite angle they reiterated their own views which are so well known to all. The four were bored but Molotov allowed the Poles to persist.   Later Stalin said all he insisted on was a general Curzon line the precise limitations of which Russia was not interested in that details would be fixed by frontier commissions and that it was high time Polish affairs were taken aside.   Last night Berut gave an interview to the British and American press correspondents during the interval at the Bolshoi Theatre silly ass . He said in effect that owing to pressure from the West Britain and U.S.S.R. and U.S.S.R. certain compromises between themselves and   Polish the emigre/govennment in London would have to be faced.  Incidentally I gather Moravski and Co. produced a very poor impression on the P.M. and S. of S. . After the ballet there was a further long discussion between the big four - in order to get the vdxed question out of the way so that more important questions on thesgenda could be dealt with. Both sides are being seen today Sunday . This morning s session lasted an hour beyond the planned break for luncheon and is going at the time of writing. But I feel at long last the Poles are going to be told what they' must do and to do it at once. Such a measure will of course not in my opinion solvejB the problem. It will temporarily get the question out of the way. Save faces for the moment and very shortly break out again. The possible advantage   . /and I, -2   and I think an important one is that by that time Poland should be cleared of Germans and the Polish people themselves become possibly a factor that will free us all from direct responsibility.   Allen and Ward P.0. have both been to lunch here. We found Allen very likeable. General Ismay has been too as most of the other visitors from London.   Before starting this letter I read this morning's Sunday Times and Observer. The plane has put up a new record -4hrs. 25 mins.   I do wish you could find the time to come to   t  Moscow for a quick trip and bring A/CD with you. I think many problems for the future could be resolved by such a visit and he of immence value in the future.   I strongly urge you to come it is one of your few parishes you have never visited and I am confident the viza question will be no obstacle.   I hope you are keeping well.

It seems to us best that a reciprocal arrangement to cover British Commonwealth prisoners liberated by the Red Army and Soviet prisoners liberated by the Western Allies should be kept separate from the Agreement about the Soviet citizens at present in the United Kingdom. The most convenient method of procedure would be for No. 30 Military Mission and you to draft an exchange of notes covering the main points which we require to obtain as regards the treatment of British Commonwealth prisoners of war liberated in Eastern Europe. The same mutatis mutandis would apply to Soviet prisoners of war liberated in Western Europe. This draft should cover only the main points leaving the full details to be worked out later by No. 30 Military Mission and the Soviet General Staff. No. 30 Military Mission already have full particulars. We should like to see such drafts in draft form. 3. As regards civilians liberated in similar circumstances we could either fit them into the draft exchange of notes referred to in the preceding paragraph or if more convenient have a further exchange of notes covering them. Presumably most of the provisions which apply to prisoners will also apply to civilians but some of the latter may not wish to be repatriated and there may be other differences. As soon as you have prepared a draft for prisoners however it will be easier to see whether civilians can be worked into it or whether a separate exchange of notes is desirable. 4. All the above of course applies only to the pre-Nsurrender period. Thereafter the question of dealing with liberated Soviet prisoners and civilians will have to be dealt with through the E.A.C. who already have some material before them on the matter. 5. You will no doubt keep in touch with your United States colleague on the matters dealt with in this telegram.

Your telegrams 3322 -3327 [of 7th November Soviet  prisoners] ' . My immediately following telegram contains a revised  text of draft agreement covering Soviet nationals in the  United Kingdom and b instructions on question of obtaining  from the Soviet Government an assurance on the subject of the  carrying out of any death sentences which may conceivably be  awarded by Soviet authorities. 2 In accordance with a suggestion made in paragraph  of your telegram No. 3327 the new draft agreement embodies as   far as is possible the points set out in the Soviet memorandum   and omits objectionable phrases. In presenting it to /the   Soviet Government you should bring the following points to their   notice in whatever way you think best. Draft Agreement . . . Article l. This differs from the original text in omitting   reference to Soviet forces and covers paragraph 5 a of your   telegram No 3523. Article 2 This is an important article and again the word    forces has been omitted. The neutral expression formations   has been used and the inclusion of this is absolutely essential  from the point of view of the law of the United Kingdom if the  Soviet military authorities are to be allowed to exercise .  Soviet military' law over these liberated Soviet citizens. This  cannot be done if the Soviet citizens are not members of.  Soviet formations and if the question were ever raised in  court it would be necessary for the Soviet authorities to prove  by such evidence as is required that these formations are  regarded by them as units or contingents of the Soviet forces.  His Majesty's Government hope that the question will in fact  never arise in court and are therefore prepared to make no  mention of forces in the draft Agreement but it must be  clearly understood that the basis of Soviet jurisdiction is  that it is exercised over persons who are members of Soviet  fomations. His Majesty's Government very imieh..hope that the  Soviet Government will accept this Article as It is  fundamental to the purpose which both they and the Soviet  Government wish to accomplish.  Article 3. This covers paragraph 5 d of your telegramNoT'SBsBT  / Article 4.., -2-  Artlole 4. This covers 5 c of vour telegram No 3523 except for the last sentence. Tne Soviet Government's proposal was that they should reimburse His Majesty's Government for this expenditure but we should very much prefer not to make any charge for these facilities and supplies on the understanding that the Soviet Government would not make any charge for similar facilities and supplies which they may grant to British Commonwealth prisoners of war who may be liberated by them. -Article 2 of Appendix II'-amounts in effect to one side of a limited mutual aid agreement and if the Soviet Government were to claim reimbursement for supplies etc. granted to British Commonwealth prisoners in the Soviet Union His Majesty's Government would have to omit the last sentence of Article 4 of Agreement and Article 2 of Appendix II and would have to claim reimbursement for the cost of supplies services etc. granted to Soviet citizens in the United Kingdom. A mutual waiver of these costs however would not only seem appropriate as between allies but would save an enormous amount of work and trouble for both sides in assessing these costs and drawing up the necessary accounts.   Article 5 The rate has already been discussed between the British and Soviet military authorities in the United Kingdom and the men are at present being paid at the rate of 5/-a week Such pay should j however be considered as an advance on behalf of the Soviet Government and unlike the costs covered by Article 4 no difficulty of assessment and accounting should arise   Article 6 This covers 5 f of your telegram No. 3323 and is slightly expanded.   Appendix I This is the same as in the original draft and with Article 2 of the Agreement covers paragraph 5 b and c of your telegram No. 3523      Appendix II This is explained above under Articles 4-and 5..   3 This only leaves outstanding the question of the carrying out of any death sentences which might be awarded by the Soviet military authorities on these Soviet citizens. Tne agreements with the other Allies which have formed the basin.for Orders under the Allied Forces Act have been accompanied by exchanges of notes stipulating that no death sentences will be carried out by the Allied military q \ authorities concerned until the competent British authorities  viz the Service Department concerned have signified their approval. It has also been agreed that if the competent British authorities felt-bound to recommend that any sentence' of death should be reduced in severity in order to bring it into harmony with the law or custom of the United Kingdom the Allied authority concerned would take the necessary steps to commute the sentence. We feel that to introduce such an exchange of notes at this stage is unnecessary and would irritate the Soviet authorities. Nevertheless the.point must be covered and unless you see objection the following procedure might be used. When you present the draft Agreement you could choose a suitable moment to point out that m the unlikely event of the Soviet authorities passing a sentence of death upon any Soviet citizen who is a member of the Soviet formations v/hich it is proposed to form it would be most embarrassing both to His Majesty s Government and.the Soviet   / S.Utheritigs., OUTWARD TELEGRAM   -3   authorities it such a sentence were to he carried out in  the United Kingdom. His Majesty s Government therefore  hope that the Soviet Government can give them an assurance  either that no such death sentences will he passed or that if  hy any chance they are they will not in any circumstances  he carried out until the condemned has been returned to the  Soviet Union. I am fully content to leave it to you to obtain  this assurance in whatever way appears most satisfactory. 4 Please see my immediately following telegram.  O.T.P., as NOVL44 / f  111   O'   SOVIET PRISONERS OP WAR.   ji agreement is proposed with the   Soviet whereby Soviet citizens liberated by the Allied forces and who. reach the U.K. may pending their return to the Soviet Union be treated as free citizens of an Allied Power organised into Soviet formations and employed n   work in furtherance of the common war effort.

Dear Sheridan  Thank you for your letter LFS/2589 of January 23rd enclosing telegrams exchanged between you and Hill in Moscow about Keswick's visit to Moscow. I see that in paragraph 3 of G.D.'s telegram to Hill of January 19th C.D speaks of arranging to work side by side with the  N.K.V.D. in countries surrounding Germany and later in Germany itself. I wonder whether you could elaborate on what is contemplated in this connection. For instance is it the intention that the work in countries surrounding Germany should be confined to establishing contacts in Germany etc. during the course of hosti lities or has 3.0.E. got in mind some arrangement for collaboration with the N.K.V.D. in Germany and the neighbouring countries in the posthostilities period Further what countries do you mean exactly. Are France Holland and Belgnm included At first sight the matter seems to have considerable political aspects quite outside Sir A. Clark Kerr's scope and I expect I shall have to submit the matter to my superiors here. j I should therefore be very grateful for more detailed information of what is proposed. Yours sincerely   Sgd. C.F.A. Warner. [  Lieut. Colonel L.F. Sheridan  M.0.1. S B. War Office., Copies to AD/S.l AD/H AD/X AD/4.   TOP SECRET. HNS/L667. 5th February 1945.   Sheridan has handed to me your letter to him of the 30th January about Keswick s proposed visit to Moscow and I should like to assure you at once that we have no intention of starting to work with N.K.V.D in Western Europe at all.   S.O.E. s target area of Germany and Germanoccupied territory is 1 am glad to say steadily growing smaller and as the ring around it tightens the time approaches when Red Army troops will be occupying areas contiguous to those occupied by British and American troops. This seems likely to happen in the area of North-Eastern Italy Yugoslavia Hungary and Austria and perhaps later in Northern Norway if we or the Americans have to send any troops to that country.   S.O.E. normally operates in advance of British and American Forces and assuming that N.K.V.D. does the same in advance of the Red Army we are bound to find ourselves working alongside them and directing our attention towards areas such as Southern Austria where we may come into contact with N.K.V.D. agents. What we have in mind and what we discussed with   / Sir   C.F.A. Warner Esq C.M.G. FOREIGN OFFICE., 4 2-   Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was the possibility of getting an agreement with N.K.V.D. which would provide at hest for full co-operation with them in areas where their troops are fighting alongside ours and at the worst for a live and let live arrangement. We also feel that if we can make some such agreement and can prove in the near futre that it can he satisfactorily implemented we may make possible a valuable co-operation with   N.K.V.D. in Germany itself during the disturbed period of spasmodic German resistance in isolated areas Ach now appears to lie ahead of us. We have not got so far as to consider the very big question of collaboration with N.K.V.D. in the post hostilities period. We feel that this must wait until we have mor& definite information about the policy of His Majesty s Government regarding subversive activity in general and about the size and shape of the future 3 0.E If however there is to be some future peace time collaboration between a future S.O.E. and N.K.V.' then presumably harmonious collabroation during the liuo stages of hostilities against Germany could only be an advantage. Further such collaboration might be of material assistance to our relations with the Russians if and when the Soviets decide to participate in the   Far Eastern war., COPY. 19/10. Copies to AD/S.l AD/H AD/X AD/4.   FOREIGN OFFICE 3. . 1.   N 1257/265/G 18th February 1945.  TOP SECRET.  My dear Harry  a  I  Your letter HNS/1667 of the 5th February to me about Keswick's proposed visit to Moscow has been considered and I am how in a position to give you the Foreign Office official views.    2. To begin with there seems to us grave reason for doubt whether such an agreement as proposed at this eleventh hour will be worth anything. It seems crery unlikely that you will ever be able to operatein Russian zones. You can operate in Germany from the Western Front or even through Italy and in any case arrangements for co-operation between S.O.E. and the  N.K.V.D. in Germany can be taken up when we know the conditions in which the British and Russian armies will be operating and what the role of S.O.E. there is to be. 3. On the other hand we could not agree to a reciprocal agreement being made as regards Italy. We do not want to take any action which the Russians could interpret as an invitation to send the N.K.V.D. into North-East Italy and although the Russian forces may get there on the other hand they may not supposing the Germans withdraw from Italy in a hurry. 4. Hungary must of course be considered as being in the Russian zone and for that reason as pointed out in paragraph 2 above you are unlikely ever to operate there. So far as Yugoslavia is concerned we / feel, 2   feel very strongly that Sacmed should he responsible   for making any arrangements with the Soviet authorities that may he necessary for the co-operation between   N.K.V.D. and your organisation in that area. The same applies to Austria. 5. As regards Northern Norway the Russians are making a point of keeping their hands off and we should therefore not like it to he suggested to the Russians that the N.K.V.D. should operate there. 6. For these reasons the Foreign Office canned CdUyve-t Sree to Colonel Keswick's proposed discussions with the Russians on this subject -at any rate in the present circumstances.    Yours ever  Sgd. C.F.A. Warner., 22 FEB   VCD/1691. To C.D.   Copies   I should like you to read the attached letter from Warner at the Foreign Office about AD/Hf s proposed visit to Moscow. This could hardly be more unsatisfactory and I fear it is another incident of Sargent s personal animus against   S.O.E. In my view we cannot possibly accept the position as it stands and if you and S.G. agree I would like to reply to Warner on the lines of the attached draft, 19.2.45. DRAFT LETTER TO C.F.A. WARMER PROM V/CD.   Thank you for your letter N 1257/265/G of the 18th February about David Keswick's proposed visit to Moscow.   I am indeed sorry to learn that the Foreign Office does not approve of our proposal to send Kesv/ick to Moscow but I am afraid we cannot allow the matter to rest there. The position is that'S.O. . has a Htreaty with N.K.V.D. under which we have certain rights and obligations. We also maintain a mission in Moscow which is in contact daily under the general supervision of the Ambassador with N.K.V.D.   The agreement as it stands is no longer satisfactory and must be regarded as quite out-of-date whilst our relations with N.K.V. D. are suffering because e r party holds the view that it is doing all the Mgivingwa nd its oppositenumber is doing all the M taking .   The unsatisfactory basis of our arrangement with N.K.V. D has been a subject of discussion between their representatives and ours in Moscow for some time past and both sides have felt that the only possible way of getting things settled would be to negotiate a new agreement of a more realistic character which would be in keeping with modern conditions. With the full knowledge and approval of the Ambassador  and indeed I think at his original suggestion we told   N.K.V.D. that we thought the best way to arrive at a new agreement would be to send one of our Directors out from London to open negotiations. If it is then found that it is easier to conclude an agreement on lines more satisfactory to us well and good. If on the other hand there is considerable delay then our representative would return to London and the next phase of negotiations would probably be carried on here with a special representative of / N.K.V.D., N.K.V.D. sent over for the purpose. With the approval of the Ambassador hH these matters have been discussed with N.K.V.D. and they have indicated their approval in principle. They told Brigadier Hill in Moscow however that they could not grant a visa for Keswick a visit until they had seen a written statement of the scope of the negotiations.  t This was the reason for Hill's recent visit to London and whilst he was here we settled a draft agenda which he has taken back with him to Moscow on the understanding that we would proceed to obtain your approval of it and would telegraph your comments. Meanwhile he will be getting the approval of the Ambassador.   Apart from the fact that Lord Selborne cannot possibly renounce his right for representatives of S.O.E. to discuss their affairs with their allied opposite numbers as and when he considers it necessary to do so you will appreciate that in view of Hill's conversations with N.K.V.D. carried on as 1 have said above with the full approval of the Ambassador we cannot possibly now tell the N.K.V.D. that our offer to sentone of our Directors to Moscow is with drawn.   It is of course always possible that when they see the agenda N.K.V.D. will say they are not willing to embark upon these conversations. If on the other hand they approve the visit will have to take place although we shall of course take every pains to keep the discussions on lines of which you would approve.   I enclose a copy of our draft agenda from which I think you will see that most of the fears expressed in your letter are unfounded. We agree with you that the agreement we contemplate will be very difficult of achievement but   /we, we differ from you in thinking that it is not worthwhile   trying. Indeed we should consider that we had failed   in our duty and had rendered a serious disservice to the   future of Anglo-Russian relations if we did not at least   try to obtain such an agreement. The suggestion you       make in the last sentence of yonjr paragraph 2. seems to us to be just the kind of thing which always causes trouble with the Russians and leads to misunderstanding. They hate improvisation and are always suspicious when   action has to be taken which they have not had time to consider fully. We already have a very clear idea of what our role will be in Germany under the Military   Government and we think it essential to discuss with the Russians at the earliest possible moment whether--it-i-s notpooeibleto rogcfa an agreement not to tread on each other s toes when the occupation of Germany has begun. You can be quite certain that there will be numbers of Russians and Germans in the British zone who will in fact be R.K.V.D. agents and the agreement we propose is our best chance of setting up Mmachinery to deal with them with the least possible embarrassment to ourselves.   You need not worry about Italy. For one thing   N.K.V.D. are there already and for another we do not think that Russian and British forces will meet on Italian territory so that this problem is never likely to arise at all in our talks with N.K.V.D. No question arises with regard to Hungary or Yugoslavia and as regards Austria we have always had every intention of obtaining the approval of S.A.C.M.E.D. to our arrangement with N.K.V.D. This we are very pleased to do as he and his staff are always extremely realistic and helpful about our problems. We quite understand the point you / make, -4   make about Northern Norway If you will be good enough to read the enclosed agenda I think you will find that it is not so terrible   a after all.

We have in fact confined the scope of our draft agenda to Germany Austria Bohemia and Moravia only. As regards Austria we have always had every intention of obtaining the approval of S.A.C.M.K.D. to our arrangement with N.K V.D. Indeed as long ago as 12th January our Liaison Staff at A.v H.Q. submitted a paper to that Headquarters requesting   S.A.C.M.E.D. to deal with the question of our co-operation with N.K.V.D if his then projected visit to Marshal / Tolbhukin, Tolbhu&in did in fact take place.    t 1 enclose a copy of our draft agenda from which I   think you will see that most of the fears expressed in   your letter are unfounded.

The matter is extremely urgent because Mil is now oack in jjoscow waiting to go ahead.

SPORBOFG.,  5 MAR 86 3 MAR 19/ ' ADH/2026 To 2nd March 1945. Prom A/DH.  I saw Warner yesterday evening on the following three points   1. Czechoslovak Problem 2. Perkins Moscow or Italy 3. My visit to Russia. We discussed these three things at length but the up-shot of our discussion in short wast   1. I explained our point of view and Warner said that he favoured a ps /rallel approach by the Foreign Office to the Russians to inform them of our proposition and he told me that he would write an instruction to Clark Kerr. This instruction would be submitted to us before despatch for comments a copy of it would be given to Nicholls so that he can press the Czech authorities to press for what we require. I have the impression that he was in favour of our proposition. 2. For purely selfish reasons Warner did not want M.P to leave England at the present time because as he pointed out the Foreign Office were lamentably ignorant of Polish affairs and did not have the intimate and somewhat informal contacts that we have. He also said that a ruling from the Crimea Conference had laid down that no one was to go to Moscow who had had intimate contact with the Polish emmigrants in London. This seems to me to be a nonsense but he had interpreted it as an order. I told him that we were not prepared to keep M.P who was probably one of our best Country'Section officers in idleness after the work of his section has come to a close as It would be most unfair to him after all his valuable services to do so. He has explained that the Polish position was very tricky still and would it be possible he said to retain M.P in London until MIKOLAJCZYK and others were on their way to Moscow. I asked him how long this would be he replied that If they had not gone in a fortnight that the whole situation would have become so disastrous that it would need new revision. I said I thought that you would be willing to keep M.P here for a fortnight but that you would not be willing to deprive him of an active post to which his services entitled him in Italy if the period he was to stay in London was much extended. 3. I tried to clear up the usual Foreign Office misconception of the extent of an arrangement between N.K.V.D and S.O.E and hope that I made some progress. I pointed out that if any benefits were to accrue from an understanding with Russia it must be done quickly and asked him to be good enough to press for some solution of this problem which has now been outstanding for so long. -   U' IAS f  S'   ACTION.......

I refer to your letter to me N 2016/265/G-of the 10th March about the proposed S.O.E. --N.K.V.D. agreement and the suggestion that Keswick or I should meet.the N.K.V.D. for discussions in Moscow.   Hill gave to the N.K.V.D. representatives copies of the proposed Agenda as finally approved by you and after various conversations and the usual delays he was informed that the   N.K.V.D. had come to the conclusion after careful consideration that nothing would be gained by the proposed visit as the moment did not seem opportune for discussions on the lines set out in the Agenda. In elaborating this decision the N.K.V.D. spokesman told Hill that they considered it too late to plan effective joint action for mutual assistance in Germany Austria and Czechoslovakia before the final collapse of the Wehrmacht. He complained that the Agenda only covered the period up to the establishment of central Allied control in Germany and added that .'in the opinion of his superiors it would probably be a more suitable time to examine possibilities for further collaboration between S.O.E. and N.K.V.D. after such central control had been established.   In the course of conversation the N.K.V.D. spokesman pointed out -that the 1941 agreement still remained in force and that S.O.E. still had a representative in Moscow although he did not think that Colonel Chichaev would be replaced in London. He commented upon the fact that no mention had been made in our Agenda about collaboration in the Par East but said he presumed that was a matter for the future.   The Foreign Office and the War Office are as you no doubt know pressing for Hill to leave Moscow and return to London in the immediate future to start learning about his new duties. We should like to use his departure as an occasion to mark our disappointment at the refusal of the N.K.V.D. to hold the proposed talks and we also think it very important to make it clear to them that we consider we-have shown willingness to co-operate with them but have been refused.   We have given careful consideration to the question of withdrawing our Mission from Moscow altogether but we feel that it is probably worth while to keep a couple of officers there because we shall in that way be keeping a foot in the door and have some direct contact with N.K.V.D. N.K.V.D. are all-powerful in Russia to-day and Russian policy is clearly developing more and more on the dangerous and unco-operative lines favoured by them. It therefore seems wise to keep this small connection with them especially as there will in future be no official N.K.V.D. representative in London.   / Hill is   C.P.A. Warner Esq. C.M. G. FOREIGN OFFICE., 2   Hill is arranging to leave Moscow on the 19th April to catch a Northern convoy. .If you agree we propose to instruct him to see.the. N.K.V.D. before he leaves and say that their refusal to grant a visa for the proposed visit has created a painful impression upon S.O.E. in London and that as it is clear that his presence no longer.serves any useful purpose he is expediting his departure which they already know about although had the visit taken place his departure would have been postponed for as long as possible. We should like him to add that we regard this refusal as a specific rejection of an   S.O.E. offer of collaboration and that in future our Mission wilf be reduced in status and will consist of two officers only of whom the senior will be a Lieut.-Colonel or possibly a Colonel. Prom our latest telegrams from Hill there appears to be some slight possibility of the N.K.V.D. issuing to us an invita tion now to have talks with them immediately the position is clear enough to do so following the cessation of organised resistance in Germany. We think such an invitation would be valuable and we propose to instruct Hill to make his communications to the N.K.V.D.   .in such a way as to leave the door open for an invitation of this kind but without however in any way appearing tq solicit it.   I shall be grateful if you will let me know whether the Foreign Office approves the line we propose to follow. Prom the imminence of the date of Hill's departure the matter is clearly somewhat urgent..    Sgd. H.N. Sporborg., o  corns TO A/CD A.D.

TOP SECRET 18th April 1945.  Dear Morton  My Minister thinks that you should see the accompanying two reports on conditions in Poland and on the Russian attitude towards British prisoners of war prepared by Lt.-Col. Peter Boughey. As you may know Boughey was sent by 3.O.E. into Hungary captured almost immediately and after a series of adventures has returned to this country through Russia ftly Minister also thinks that you would be interested to hear from Boughey himself his story in rather more detail and hopes that you will be able to give him half an hour of your time one day.  Boughey is at present on leave but is coming back to London on Wednesday next for a short time and it would be convenient if you could possible manage to see him on the after noon of that day. Perhaps you would very kindly ask your secretary to let me know.  Yours sincerely  Sir Desmond Morton K.C.B. C.M.C. M.C. 10 Downing Street London S. W. 1   /, MP/GEN/6761 12th April 1945-   To CD through A/DH Prom MP   When S.O. interviewed Lieut-Colonel Boughey he instructed him to prepare a factual and concise paper on the general attitude of the Russians to British prisoners of war. This paper is attached.   S.O. requested that it should he prepared immediately and sept'to him with the least possible delay. In making this report Colonel Boughey has taken particular care to avoid expressing his own opinions or to try and analyse the implications of the facts which he is reporting. I fear myself that this has made the report a little colourless hut in view of the gravity of the subject dealt with it is perhaps wisest to sti.ck to pure factual evidence and leave others to draw their own conclusions.   Note to C.D.   Although M.P. refers to the attached as factual evidence I find that most of it is second or third hand and comes largely from Poles who have no particular reason for being impartial.,  COPY   RUSSIAN ATTITUDE TOWARDS BRITISH PRISONERS-OP-WAR   With the advance of the ioiesian Armies towards the West the Germans made every effort to evacuate prisonerseof-war further into Germany. In many cases this evacuation was carried out in a most brutal and ruthless fashion and only a very few prisoners managed to remtin behind either in hospitals or by hiding themselves. The prisoners who remained behind did not dare to venture outside or they would have been shot either whilst trying to cross the German or the Russian lines. They therefore anxiously awaited the speedy advance of the Russians and anticipated a warm welcome which they in turn were ready to reciprocate in gratitude for at last being released. In actual fact this gratitude was in mo t cases stillborn by the initial reception which they received from the Russians.   The arrival of the first Russians was generally a sign for systematic looting of the prisoners. Watches clothes and food were taken. Russian soldiers entered hospitals demanding that these articles should be handed over at the point of their tommy guns. At Sagan a band of Russians headed by an officer drove up in trucks forced the stores and rem&ved all the food reserves of the hospital knowing full well that the only Inmates of the hospital were British American and French soldiers.   /Most of, 2   Most of the wounded were forced by the Russians to leave the hospital and march 150 kma. to Gels near Breslau. These men received little or no aid from the Russians on this march some died of exhaustion and many were again plundered en route. The same story is true of the whole route to Odessa. Even in the trAine Russian soldiers would come in and steal clothing and food. This was carried to an extreme when after a bad train smash one British soldier trapped in the wreckage and in great pain and calling for help received no assistance from the   Russian soldiers who only attempted to relieve him of his wrist watch.   Though individual acts of kindness were un doubtedly shown to a number of British the above short account is Illustrative of the general treatment which was received and it was depressing to most of them that there was not the feeling of goodwill which they had anticipa ted They were received at the best with indifference and coldness if not definite hostility.   This marked coldness and unhelpfulness by our Allies was naturally noted by the Poles to whom it came as no surprise as they believe that Russia is preparing    near   to attack England in the/future. They statedthat Poles returned from east of the Urals have seen large   /quantities, -3   quantities of Russian equipment being turned out in the factories and stored there and that this equipment was not being used on the Eastern Front. The latter part of the story appears true as the major part of the equipment seen in the central sector was American and British with the exception of the artillery which appeared to be largely Russian. They pointed out that the large Russian Army after having seen the standard of living in the West and having lived on the fat of the land will not be prepared to return quietly to the squalor and poverty in Russia and that therefore this army will have to be occupied else   where.   The above remarks they profess to have heard from Russian soldiers and officers themselves and it is true that on more than one occasion Russian soldiers have told even British soldiers that they will soon have to fight the large capitalist states.   In conclusion therefore it is apparent that in   a country where propaganda finds such fertile soil amongst the masses no effort had been made to eradicate the illfeeling propagated prior to 19U0. The impression given to liberated prisoners-ef-war was still one of hostility and distrust and they are undoubtedly returning to their respective countries with no good-will towards Russia or Russian methods of Government.   April 1945,  COPY  Report of Personal Conditions In Poland  by Lt Col. Boughey  From 23rd February to 17th March 1945.  POLITICAL  Officially the Lublin Government is com posed of representatives of four parties the  P.P.R. the CoiuBunist Party the P.P.3. the Christian Democrats and the Peasant Party. Under the German occupation these parties sur vived underground and still survive now under the Russians the Communist Party howevor is the only one which has dared to come to the surface. The Russians therefore re-formed the other three parties themselves nominating obscure persons with Communist views as leaders. The representatives of these parties in the Government ars therefore in reality Communists with another party label round their necks. The real leaders of these other parties however do exist underground. The present Lublin Government is held in almost universal contempt by all classes as most of the Ministers axe mere cyphers under Russian tutelage. Three however do carry weight GOHOLKA the ice Prime Minister BERMAN the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs and DROBNER. Of these three BERMAN is the key figure and flies regularly between Moscow an Lublin with orders from Mo scow.   over, At a meeting of the Underground National Committee delegatur held at the beginning of March the intransigent attitude of the Government in Tingland was condemned. It was unanimously agreed that Poles must   s   accept the loss of Eastern territory and co operate with the Russians the following conditions however were demanded before co operation were possibles    n The withdrawal of Russian troops except along lines of communication.  b The arrival of an Anglo-american commission which would permit the real leaders of the political parties under the commission s safeguard to go to Moscow to parti cipate in discussions regarding elections and the fomation of a representativ Government.  o An election on free democratic lines. vith regard to point c the scheme for the election is as fdllowsj All candidates must submit in writing the policy they intend to support in Parliament under present conditions however this is impossible as they would be arrested immediately if they advocated any policy other than communism. It is unlikely therefore there will be any other candidates other than the representatives of the P.P.R., 3-  PROFAG DA  All printing machines have been de clared illegal and. confiscated b the Russians. Even typewriters have to be re gistered. A corporate printing concern with the sole monopoly of printing all news papers and books has been established through out the country under Government control re placing the previous system. newspapers and books so printed can only bo distributed through shops affiliated to the printing con cern. The result therefore will be that when existing book-shops have exhausted their present stocks they will be forced to come under Government control or else close down.  All wireless sets are still forbidden and in place loud speakers are placed in parks and public places tuned to Lublin or Soviet con trolled stations. LAHD RSKiRL.  Under the new land reform decrees no person is permitted to own more than 50 hectares of agricultural or forest land. here a person owns more than this area the total land and house is confiscated and the former owner is not permitted to reside in the same Toivodztso or county. Further all clothes and furniture must be left behind. The only course open to the ex-landowner therefore is to endeavour to find some lodging in a town where he can live as inconspi cuously as possible. The shortage of  . ..over, -4   aooomodation in the tovima is making this increasingly difficult. The ex-landowner is compensated by a monthly allowance of SOO Zlotys. Many have already been arrested and d sorted to a Russian concentration camp at Kaluga south of Moscow For example all the Radziwill family have bean arrested with the exception of Prince Michael and de ported to Kaluga. The family of Count Potocki Polish Ambassador in Madrid have all been arrested and sent to Kaluga   The confiscated land is divided amongst the peasants by a local committee composed of the Communist elements from the village and the local Russian commandant .There the manor house has not been burnt it is first pillaged by the Russian soldiers and then turned over to the village committee   The land is parcelled into areas of 7 hectares and allocated to the peasants who receive it with much distrust and misgivings as in most eases it is impossible for the peasant to farm this area economically if at all. It appears therefore that the immediate result of the reform will be that the peasant will be unable to obtain a livelihood much less pay the land taxes and will therefore be forced to relinquish the holding to some system of collec tive farming from which he can support himself and his family., -5   K.X.V.D The Russian secret police is very strong and it is estimated that there are as nany as 80 000 agents scattered throughout Poland as against the previous number of 30 000 Gestapo. The methods of the H.K.V.D are infiniteiy more subtle than the Gestapo whereas the latter when making arrests went roaring through the streets with sirens blowing and hammering on doors the K.K.V.D. make their arrests quietly either at night or in the daytime in the street. Xobo.dy is able to find out where or what has happened to the arrested persons. If enquiries are made evasive replies are received or the persons are directed from one bureau to another. The N.K.V.D. agents are usually dressed as ordinary infantry officers or in civilian clothes. Some however wear the K.K.T.D. flashes on their uniform. There is no official H.h . but agents live in small groups   in a house the collars of which are used as their prison those cantres are dotted about all large towns. There are also centres of observation at most main crossings and important points in a city. Here prisoners are taken and made to point out important or interesting passers-by with promises of release. There has been no evidence of physical torture but moral pressure is applied through long hours of interrogation and the condition under which prisoners are housed and fed. For example   .over, G under ise of oonstruoting aerodromes cells have been dug in the fields covered over with wood and turf and prisoners are confined either singly or in groups in these underground prisons.  tip to the present the arrests have been made chiefly amongst members of the Secret Army and the landowning class arid although it was impossible to obtain any accurate figures it is certain many thousands have been arrested and many more are going about in genuine fear that they will a ieily disappear at any time. The distressing feature is that for six years many of these persons have gone about in fear of arrest from the Gestapo and now find that they are still in the same predicament. aRIiY  The Polish Amor been reconstituted under Russian guidance and control. The rank and file consist mainly of Poles from Russia whilst all new recruits receive partial if not all their training in Russia. The standard of education for officers has been relaxed and most junior officers have been drawn from the ranks. All officers of the rank of Major and upwards are Russian and in most cases are unable to speak Polish. Uniforms are lacking for many men and in place they wear a red and white arm band. Troops are armed with Russian rifles.  Polish officers returning from P.O.'ff. oamps, -7   in Germany are automatically placed on the reserve list together with officers who stayed in Poland during the German occupation. Since the Prime Minister s declaration in the House concerning the Polish /i.rmy in England these officers are asking whether they too cannot be given British nationality as in many cases they have fought longer and more consistently than their brothers in England. mSKHATlORiL ORG.PNIZATIQKS  fhe position of international organiza tions is precarious. In particular the Polish Red Cross has already suffered. All their funds have been confiscated their work has been restricted and a number of their workers arrested among them Mrs. Arciszowski the wife of the Polish Prime I'inistc She has now been released owing to a protest from Mr. Eden but the other workers are still con fined . The Y.M.C.A. has started again but is having great financial difficulties and has not yet been able to re-oocupy all their premises requisitioned by the Germans. They are also looked upon unfavourably by the Russians. The Boy Scouts have re-appeared but are facing severe official competition from the Young Fighters. It is however the Red Cross which has been singled out for immediate attack and they urgently require assistance. THE CHURCH  Eo reports have been received of any  over, -8   persecution of the Church or of priests in particular. Churches are full and no pillaging has taJcen place.   The Lublin Covernment has issued new Zloty notes. These notes however bear no signature apparently have no cover and aro looked upon with much scepticism. Each Pole is permitted to exchange S00 of the old Zlotys for new money this has caused great hardship throughout the country as the sun is so infinitesimal against the cost of . living. All Bank deposits have been blocked and as yet no statement has been made. Borne bankers believe they will bo permitted to liquidate deposits over a year or more at say 10% a time others believe they will have to be written off. The rate of exchange for notes on the Black Bourse averages 150 Zlotys  to the and 300 to the sterling. Wages   have risen only slightly. Civil servants are   paid on an average 2000 Zlotys a month   manual workers 1 000 to 1 500 Zlotys a month.   Writers and actors are paid 3 000 to 4 000   Zlotys a month. For instance the director of   the Cracow opera gets 4 000 Zlotys a month.   Army officers are paid well and receive from   2 000 Zlotys as a Lieutenant to 8 000 Zlotys a   month as a lla or.   Since the advent of the now Government   prices of Public Jtility and Government controlled, concerns have been approximately quadruxiled. This applies to newspapers gas tram fares electric light water railway fares and telephones. FOOD   Food is very scarce and becoming scarcer. What supplies were not taken hy the Germans have been taken by the Russians and so even in the country there is a real shortage.   Ration cards have been issued in three categories. 1st Class to civil servants 2nd Class to persona working for the Government and 3rd class to others. However food is only obtainable for 1st class ration cards and the remainder must buy in the black market which is openly rampant.   Prices on the black market are soaring and on March loth bread was costing 100 Zlotys a kilogram. Meat 400 to 300 a kilogram. Sugar 1000 Zlotys. Tea 8000 Zlotys. Coffee 2000 Zlotys. Eggs 10 Zlotys. Butter 600 Zlotys..   At the beginning of March a number of workers at Katowice and Sosnowice went on strike as they were unable to obtain sufficient food to feed themselves and their families and at the same time to work the long hours that were re quired of them l.e. 12 hours a day. There is no doubt the food shortage is acute and will become more so each day. INDUSTRY   It appears the policy of the Russian   .... over, -10   Government Is to suppress industry in Poland in order to make them dependent on Russia for all manufactured articles. In the Katowice and Lodz areas complete factories have 'been dismantled ana transported to Russia. From Lodz all supplies of raw materials have   been sent to Russia. TRAIISPORT AKD PUBLIC SERVICES   Transport is in a had condition. German demolitions in Poland have been thorough and this added to the fact that the Russians are changing one line to.broad gauge leaving the other for European rolling stock has pro duced a chaotic situation. Passenger trains virtually do not exist and therefore civilians must take their chance to perch themselves on goods trains or military transport. Journeys which before the war took a few hours now take days even for military traffic. Rolling stock both   Russian and Polish is in a bad condition. POSTAL SERVICES   No communications are yet permitted with other countries except Russia. Public telegraph and telephone communications between towns has not yet been resumed though in most cases the telephone system in the towns has been restored. In Cracow for instance it is even possible to have a telephone installed if sufficient bribe Is given to the right quarter. The postal service is poor. For instance letters between, 11   Warsaw and Cracow take a minimum of ten days.   Even between addressee in Cracow Itself it   takes two days. This delay is caused partly   by the transport situation and partly by the   very severe censorship which exists openly   even for letters between addresses in the same   town.   PUBLIC OPINION   There is little support for the London Government but it is felt that the inclusion of some of its better members into the Lublin Government might act as a check to Hussian control which is at present complete. The name of Mr. Mikolajczyk commands respect and it is hoped that he also will be included in the new Government as it is believed that he is on good terms with Moscow.   Without exception all people are most disappointed with the non-implementation of the Crimea Agreement. Even so there is great friendliness both towards tne British and the Americans in particular the fomer although this is tempered with some disillusionment and even bitterness. People still believe however that these two Governments will step in to safeguard the independence of a Poland however small the territory this may comprise.   There appears to be no bitterness towards either England or Lussia concerning the Warsaw Rising. It is genuinely felt that this was a   .... ov r, 12   great mistake largely due to the personal ambition of General Bor. Once it had started however there was no turning back even though people knew after the first few days that the position was hopeless., S   COPY    If 3891/265/0 EOREIGTT OPPICE 3 . 1 IT-MEDIATE 19th April 1945. TOP SECRET  My dear Harry   Please refer to your letter HNS/1827 of the 16th April and your previous letter to me of the 7th April about S.O.E. co-operation with the N.K.V.D.   In view of the lf.K.V.D. s Invitation to   S.O.E. to send a special representative to Moso&w to discuss possibilities of future collaboration between thetwo organisations I take It that you no longer wish Hill to deliver the message outlined In paragraph 7 of your letter of the 7th April. The matter can therefore be considered entirely on the basis of your letter of the 16th April. We have no objection to Benham proceeding to Moscow. As regards sending out a special re presentative the difficulty of course is that no definite decision has yet been taken about the future of S.O.E. and S.O.E. is therefore not in a position to enter into firm co3tnltaents with the Russians covering a period when it may no longer be in existence. In these circumstances while it seems to us desirable that S.O.E. should send a special representative to Moscow as soon as the position Is clear enough for the Russians to wish this to he done it must he made clear to the Russians that we are ourselves uncertain about what conditions will be after 7.E. Day and that   S.O.E./   H.N. Sporhorg Esq., S.0 . cannot enter into commitments of any kind event Indirect -with the H K.V I . for work after   V.E. Day without prior approval from London. The Russians should also be asked for particulars about what exactly they have in mind as regards future collaboration between the two organisations which we shall be happy to consider. There is no reason why Hill should not deliver a message on these lines to the Russians before his departure from Moscow. If the Russians really want to co-operate on this kind of work a message on these lines should show them that we are interested and give them adequate encouragement. If on the other hand their apparent desire to collaborate is not really genuine nothing will have been lost by our not being more forthcoming than this.    5-' .v Yo\irs ever    SIGJTED CHRISTOPHER WARHER.

The Prime Minister hae as you no doubt know already stated that it is his intention that 3.0 1. should continue after the war and Indeed the vorei n secretary himself in a minute to the Prixae Minister written as long ago aa the 23rd Hovciaber 194% stated that he saw advantage in oar M work being carried on All that is la doubt is the W place that 8.0 it will eventually occupy in the machine of gsymimtemt  Secondly we think It would be most unwise to tell the Bassiens aa you suggest that we cannot enter into any comiaitaients as to working with the M without prior approval frost London. By the time the diecaogioas take place the situation after Vis-day will be known because it has been made clear that the meting is not to be held until It is known. Also by that time we may have a clearer idea of the work S tvB. will be called upon to do in -the iuifiaediate post-hostiliti phase.

Clearly they will not enter upon the proposed discussions without a written Agenda dnd it would be a very good thing if we could induce the to put up the first draft of it. -i.V ... . V, COPY. TB7T2. FOREIGN OFFICE S.W.l. Jlf.r 16th May 1945.  N 4771/265/G TOP SECRET. S O /r  Dear Sporhorg   I am sorry not to have replied earlier to your letter HNS/184'6 of the 27th April about S.O.E. co-operation with the N.K.V.D.   We entirely agree with the last paragraph of your letter and in any conversations with the   N.K.V.D. the S.O.E. representative should regard himself as being on a fishing expedition. We should certainly do all we can to persuade the Russians to put forward a written agenda which they could be told would have to be considered in London. If this is done I do not think that there is any need to tell them that you cannot enter into any commitments without prior approval from London.   As regards paragraph 5 of your letter the general question of S.O.E.'s future is not my affair and it will be preferable for me not to discuss it in the absence of detailed information of either the present position or the back history.
