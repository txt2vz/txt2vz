I. Cagngi L COHSI&gUTICKTS. The Y Units concerned consist of three Platoons each equipped with six W T interception receivers and each Platoon borne on the strength of one of the three U 3 Air Cosmand Headquarters. It is not considered that six  W.T. sets alone can produce an Intelligence W.T.I. service of direct use to a Command Headquarters. Furthermore it appears to be unnecessary in this country to duplicate comprehensive work already being done by the Cheadle organisation.  itate of the Units -The first Platoon is now about to complete its training under U.J. arrangements and is available for operational work. The other two Platoons are just arriving and will be ready for operational work on about 1st of October 1943.  II. PROFOdALS. In view of considerations above and of the fact that Cheadle has need of facilities for cover which at present cannot be taken through lack of setsjj the following proposals have been formulated for agreement   a The role cover at present taken by the Cheadle orgenisationj at Tean Hear Cheadld If possible   b The three Motet At present Tean appears to have sufficient acooramodation for the    full eighteen sets but difficulties arise in the matter of billeting.]   c The cover to be taken by the U.3. contingent to be agreed between. the 0/0.

HI. ACTION TO BE TahHl IP AgHBSMSflr IS REACHED UPON THE ABOVE PROPOaALS.   a The W.T.I. Platoon of U.S. Bomber Command already trained should take over the W.T. station and existing accommodation at Tean. It is understood that the U.d. Authorities would apply for the necessary transfer of the billeting area assigned to them. Note The buildings are at present on the charge of the local Home Guard who will be clear of them during the first week in August.   b With the arrival of the other two Platoons on about 1st of October the personnel involved at Tean will amount to approxi mately 130 Officers and men. It appears necessary therefore that an Immediate reconnaissance of existing accommodation and billeting should be made and additional accommodation huts etc. applied for if required. /IV., iv. ai coi mabd Ha UAHTSiis. la tiie interests of obtaining full value from available W.T.I. at Command Headquarters and also In the important interest of security it is thought necessary to maintain one or two U S. W.T.I. Officers at each Command Headquarters. The proposed direct landline from Cheadle to the Commands would terminate at this officer who on the one hand would be in a position to explain where necessary the Intelligence received and to advise the Command Intelligence Officer as to what was available. This would be in addition to his function aa a W.T.I. security Officer. V. AOTIOH. If this need is agreed it is thought that suitable W.T.I. Officers should now-be earmarked and sent to Cheadle for training in the organ satioi0/C. Cheadle la prepared to accept six /T Officers or men as soon as they are available.

This situation will be relieved when the particular portion of Cheadle's activities that entail passing this information to that station is removed to B.P.

Herewith a suggested programme with three explanatory memoranda covering the proposed training course of U.S.A. Y personnel. 2. In order that the scope of the course be clearly defined an authoritative rating A B or  C as defined in Memorandum No.2 is required. 3. It will be appreciated that Grade A corresponds to the normal W/T I knowledge of a B 1 Type Section Grade B to that of an A Type Section and C represents the highest grade of pure W/T I the latter being obviously the ultimate desirable goal. 4. As it is intended to open the course not later than Monday next 24th August 1942 your early decision will be appreciated. Colonel G.S, Subject Americans' Training Course  MEMORANDUM NO.1.  It is intended to treat all matters from an entirely W/T I view point. No mention of G.C.& C.S. at B.P. will be made. No.6 Intell igence School and British Y Stations will be treated as a closely allied grouping when mentioned. It will be necessary if grade C is applied to use all the E & P Colour names and to be supplied by N0.6.I.S. with Discriminants to the same extent as British Y Stations.  E will be defined as a 6 letter indicator 5 letter Machine cipher  P will be defined as Hand key -5 letter cipher .  Reference to units will be made only when 1 documents or publication in the Press have made them known or 2 the minor codes reveal them.  The closest security will be observed regarding all Most Secret matters. The appearance of any leakage arising from the reasoning or imagination of trainees will be reported and guidance sought as to suitable action. If in spite of full precautions this happens responsibility cannot be accepted., Subject Americans' Training Course  MEMORANDUM HO.2.  Scope of Programme.  The Americans' Training Course will not have the advantage of using and seeing an established Y station except for possible brief visits. Nor will the personnel be proceeding to an already established Y centre where any laclc of experience on their part might be filled out by con tact with more experienced staff.  A model station will have to be created and the I work done upon its products. It is presupposed that the personnel are good operators and have been ehosen as potential instructors.  The programme is designed therefore to create a working model station and a working Intelligence section as the first stage. In its later stages it is intended to widen the scope of the Intelligence work to cover the aspects of W/T I which have been found practicable and valuable. The maSCLmum scope intended is shown in the subjects tested for treatment at the end of the programme .  The programme is applicable in three graded sets of conditions   A Low Grade corresponding to 3 type section a mobile section tactical in scope dealing in minor codes cognisant of ciphers for distinction purposes only.  B Medium Grade corresponding to A type section a semi-stationery section tactical-strategical in scope larger in personnel w ll connected to higher Y centres observing and doing W/T I on  F and E if specially authorised dealing with F Cryptograph ically .  c High Grade. Full scale interception keeping long term record engaged on long term W/T I on all ciphers and codes. if spec ially authorised in close liaison with G.C.& C.S. i.e. forwarding traffic and accepting some measure of cover control . NB. All three Grades can be treated from W/T I angle only.  It is intended that the trainees should be able to turn instructors and expand the Model Y group into several groups of the grade on which the programme is applied or grades below ifi any ., , Subject Americans' Training Course.  1st Week PHOGRAMME  Day 1.

I had intended to issue these without more ado until during my recent visit to North Africa I received disturbing reports about the security of the U.S. main 'Y' Station. There were also indications that the French had somehow got hold of forecasts oil German Army call-signs.

Chairman SIGIHT BOARD., z / fActcst  Km It r st, SECRET. Signals Journal Broadway Buildings Broadway S.W.l.  23rd July 1945  To The Chainnan Signal Intelligence Board  Prom Secretary Signal Intelligence Board.  I would direct your attention to Minute 86 of the 13th Meeting of the 'Y' Committee held on 18.7 45 reading as follows   86. COOPERATION WITH AMERICMS.  Cmdr. Hughes said that the Admiralty were in the habit of giving wide circulation to their station narratives giving complete cover reports -i.e. to all Naval authorities overseas and also to the Dominions and Americans. He wondered whether the Sigint Board had recently considered the policy underlying this having regard to the fact that a station such as Scarborough covered no enemy traffic at all. In any event the Admiralty had never received any equivalent narrative from other countries. The Chairman said that he had made enquiries and was in a position to state that the current policy was to continue as at present.  At the request of the Committee the Chairman undertook that he would see that the attention of the Board was drawn to the current position with a view to getting a new ruling in the matter.  Although the distribution of numbered copies does not include any Dominion or American formations it would appear that the  Board have now to decide whether in view of the fact that other transmissions are beginning to appear in the reports our policy should be changed and that copies should be reserved for British recipients  only., , H PST SECRET.  INFORMATION FOR THE U.S.  A great difficulty has arisen as to what information may be passed to the i-imericans.  They have already been given verbally full information on our radio counter-measures and are now asking    a For written material on the same subject.  b To attend meetings of our Radio Counter-Measures Oonmittee. The principal objection to agreeing to these requests is that information obtained from M.S.S. is referred to in some of the only relevant series of reports which are serially numbered and therefore indicate the existence of others and also at the meetings  in question.  No indication of the origin of the information is of course mentioned in either case and it might perfectly well have been obtained from other sources such as prisoners of war.  The question is of great importance since a refusal of these apparently reasonable requests may lead to serious illfeeling.,  1  NO MINUTES TO BE WRITTEN ON THIS JACKET  BRANCH MEMORANDA B.M.

The position as I see it is as follows  a Admiralty passes a daily signal to Admiral Cunningham which contains a digest of items of the Special Intelligence to which I have access.  b It is understood that the Air Ministry send a weekly telegram to the Air Marshal which contains some Special Intelligence.  c The War Office pass to the Field Marshal Technical Information and Long Term reports extracted from Special Intelligence.  2 Transmission of Special Intelligence to the American Authorities.   a The C.N.O. Washington receives from me any items of Special Intelligence which may affect the American Naval Forces in areas outside our Home Waters.  b The American Admiral operating with the Home Fleet receives certain Ultra Messages.  c Admiral Stark receives a daily bulletin from me of what I think is necessary for him to know. I am not aware whether the other Ministries pass Special Intelligence to the Americans.  GENERAL   i In order that the Senior British Officers in U.S. should be able to discuss items of intelligence with the appropriate U.S. Officers it is necessary that some directions  should be issued to authorise this procedure.   ii It will soon become evident to the Americans that we are in possession of Special Intelligence which has not been passed to them in the orthodox way.   iii It is becoming increasingly important that the Americans should be aware of all major items of Special Intelligence in order to prevent them from drawing incorrect conclusions, [MOST SEC  Brigadier A.L.

Subject Control of dissemination and use of radio intelligence 1. The extreme importance of of exagr information has been repeatedly demonstrated. From no other form of intelligence can the enemy's intentions he so postively determined.  2. In view of these facts it precaution be taken with regard to controlling the dissemination and use of radio intelligence in order to avoid drying up its sources. Any disclosures in the past with regard to the source of radio intelligence have invariably resulted in an immediate change in the emqy's communications and the consequent loss of weeks or months of painstaking effort on the part of our radio intelligence personnel. It is recognised of course that radio intelligence is of no value unless proper operational use can be made of it. However momentary tactical advantage is seldom worth the risk of compromising the source for such compromise will stop the flow of information and thereby vitally affect operations on all fronts and in all areas. 3. In order to further the maintenance radio intelligence the following regulations for the dissemination and use of this intelligence are hereby prescribed  a The utmost secrecy shall be used in dealing with decryption intelligence i.e. information resulting from the reading of enemy encrypted despatches.  b Radio intelligence should be passed on to subordinate commanders only in the form of operational directives whenever practicable.  c When such intelligence must be given out to lower commanders as information it should be passed without any reference to its secret source and should contain somewhere near the beginning of the message the word ULTRA. or the word ZEAL . V --J  d Special care must be taken in every command to insure that radio intelligence is provided with special security safeguards and is seen and handled by the absolute minimum number of persons required for its use. Cryptographic systems of the highest available security and the narrowest distribution which includes the originator and addressees shall always be used for trans mitting radio intelligence.  e Every effort must be made to avoid indicating any connection between the source of intelligence and the outsome of operations. When action is based on radio intelligence local commanders will insure that the action cannot be traced to this source of intelligence alone. All copies of radio intelligence messages should be destroyed by burning as soon as possible after being read. Ships at sea where eneny action is possible should take particular precautions to destroy all evidences of intelligences sources in order that there may be no possibility of their falling into enemy hands.

Personal  No.702.  Tour memorandum of 22nd June enclosing serial 0325520 from 0. in C  U.S. Fleet and C.N.O. and your letter of 30th June concerning Midway Press articles. I Consider that while the U.S. orders concerning the handling of Special Intelligence represent progress in right direction they urgently need further tightening up in the following respects.   1 When passing on Special Intelligence to auttorities not normally entitled to receive it this must repeat must be done in the form of operational orders.  2 The cyphers used must be specially authorised for this purpose and distribution of the cypher keys or machine settings roust be restricted to the appropriate authorities.  3 It must be laid down that only certain officers in each command or ship are to decypher and have knowledge of contents of Special Intelligence. The names of these officers to be recorded.  4 The Special prefixes such as Jtymatic or Ultra are only to be used in messages passed to authorities who receive.-Special Intelligence so that they can identify the source. These prefixes must not be used to lower commands vide c of  U.S. Memo .  5 Important to emphasise that there should be no reference to Special Intelligence in War Diaries Reports of proceedings etc. Conclusion  Request you will show this telegram to Admiral Cunningham and make every endeavour to get U.S. authorities to conform to the above which have been adopted in this country as a result of much experience. It is also urged that arrangements be made with Press whereby all repeat all matter produced by press men accredited to Fleet is submitted to censorship before publication.  1840/7. 7. 42., .t  14010 Wt.50803/136 50 000 3/40 A.& E.W.Ltd.

By order of the Commanding General and for the better co-ordination of intelligence derived from other sources but of immediate value to Signals Intelligence Services as well as to provide a channel of communication for intercept and radio position finding information between Special Staffs and General Staff a Signals Intelligence  Sigs.l sub-section of G-2 Section A.F.H.Q. is now being established. Appointments to this sub-section are being made partly from American Offices with S.I.S. experience and partly from British Officers with intercept experience so that liaison with both British and American Units performing similar functions may be achieved without difficulty. 2. In order to achieve closest liaison between G-2 A.F.H.Q. and Chief Signal Officer A.F.H.Q. and specifically between Sigs.l. and S.I.S. the following general principals will be observed a. Sigs.l will be the normal channel through which intercept information obtained by S.I.S. is passed for the attention of A.C. of S. G-2 A.F.H.Q. b. All technical information of assistance to intercept units received by Sigs.l will be made available to S.I.S. for onward transmission except that in the case of British Forces this will be passed through G-2 channels to I Branch next lower H.Q. c. All intelligence information likely to enable intercept units to evaluate the importance or otherwise of the traffic they are taking will similarly be routed through S.I.S. and G-2 channels. d. Conversely Sigs.l will receive from S.I.S. all technical and intelligence information as defined in paras b and c above for onward transmission through G-2 channels to 'I branch next lower British H.Q. e. Sigs.l will also have access to all messages whether decoded or deciphered or not and logs received by S.I.S. in order to co-ordinate these with similar traffic received direct from I branch British Forces. f.

Bicher seems unhappy about the lack of contact between Forrer and Hayes and thinks that even though Biddulph is getting the information from us it may not be reaching Hayes.  I have therefore arranged that copies of all telegrams sent to Biddulph by Lithgow shall be copied to Bicher who will then find out from Hayes if he is getting the benefit of the information and let me know. Brigadier A.L. Harris r.hai -rman Y Committee, MOST SECRET.  CHAIRI'JM 1Yf BOARD.  I1  Reference the attached I saw Wallace today and he produced these extracts from his letter. He was in fact only trying to pour oil on troubled waters as a result of a very rude letter from Forrer to Lycett to which the latter decided not to reply.  Para.2 of CXG 101 is not at all satisfactory. These B.M. reports according to Wallace contain certain Ultra information. It seems odd that Lycett has agreed to send these extracts via Richer to Hayes. There may be good reason for this. I think this needs looking into. Travis may knoYJ something about it.  If you wish me to look further into the matter I will take up with Travis in the first place.  1st February 1943.,  . f iftj t&j attracts fron persons.1 letter T/.

As regards your relations with 11 1.8. it is obvious they do not and could not dictate the   ta sks for your Army or Corps Units but it is equally certain that unless your Units take and you wire to lT.E. material of another sort your Staff won t get the answers which they must have. As you know there are certain m/f networks of great importance which can only be heard by your s people and that stuff is wanted for its own value and to provide a means of getting at other things Para 3. As to the nature and extent of our co-operation  and therefore yours with Bicher we are all rather worried. Far too much has been said and the result might lead to a competition in regard to the most secret matters. The Committee and Board are just now faced with this and must evidently decide some policy para 4. I don t know whether there is anything we can do to help you If you feel that personal representation to W.G. or B.P. of any of your troubles by me would assist I think' the only way' would be for you to ask Uockler-Perryman about it para 9.

A number of such Officers are holding responsible positions in both S.A.G.S.E.A. and Air Command. Inability to pass them certain Naval material is seriously impeding the efficient execution of those responsibilities. A still greater degree of integration in this Command is now under consideration and the continual denial of Naval Ultra will render the situation almost impossible. There fore suggest the case be again presented to Washington in the strongest possible terms. Typex BONES. T.0.0. 2611302/11/14. HR 5184. T.O.R. 2618502/11/44. Cypher Office 2622062/11/44. Registry .

We discussed at today1 s meeting the question of OSS agents coming to U.K. from the continent and you said you wished to discuss the matter with the Americans.  The position is that I have been given the names but no other particulars of four persons arriving shortly and described as being Category C. agents and have been asked to facilitate their transit through the controls. From what Norman Pearson said last night I gather that these people are coming to this country for training as parachutists and will be under guard while they are here.  I discussed the matter with Colonel Adam. He said that the current procedure in similar'cases with S.I.S. and S.O.E. is that if we are supplied in advance with names and particulars the individuals are allowed to proceed to their destination and do not normally go to L.R.C. He added that if you were discussing the question it would be advisable to cover the S.A.S. position too since that is obscure.  Meanwhile I am telling the Americans that the two people arriving today will be let through and that you will be discussing the general question with them.  M.I.5./War Rook/6. 14.11  4A. I i o .

Richard Butler MI- Nnsign Reorge Forney OSS Mr. John Jaldron OSS Mr.-Norran ii. Pearson OSS Lt. Winston M. Scott 033 Lt. 3dward Lawler 033  Lt.ooi. Robertson The definition of an accredited agent. I believe you can best explain this Captain. Oapt. As you know we give our agent a certain number. The sections who are going to use that man and feel feat they -know -enough about him to take the full responsibility for-it allot him in registry that number and he becomes an accredited agent Je get a demand to land an agent they ask if he is accredited. -Te say yes and number is such and such and then cheek on him. That man is now sufficiently proven to them to take full resocnsibillty Secondly there are certain people who are not accredited agents who have for some reason sufficiemt-importance to be landed as a special case. Those cases have to be submitted higher to deputise and have to be considered to get man exempted.from. LRC and then will he act. Pull responsibility for the individual in this country during that time is curs. Trouble-has arisen where Section would hear of a man who would be suitable and they would ring and say he is an agent and the termwas so loose that you couldn't tell-how much was known about the. fellow and' can't land people on those conditions taut have to have sufficient infornation about them. It was of importance to make the T Sections appreciate responsibility forcing them to put the man' into' registry and then there is no question about him. Mr. Pearson .fee they accredited from .Belgium for example before arrival uapt. .i. No they aren't reople are sent to LuU and get a security report and are recommended as either entirely suitable for use or unsuitable because of dishonesty or stupidity etc. the Ps/v recruited in the country can get an adequate security check in this country but Ps/w abroad do not get adequate interrogation  THIS IS A COPY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RElAINED IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION, Lt. Col. Robertson At LRC they offer or reckon that if Belgian Czech or Dutch they do get a good security check and they can tell you whether.-they are what they sojj or not. It is to-our interests to safeguard your 033 interests and we believe we can render good service in this direction. Mr. rearson proposing straight LRC and not side door t Lt. Col. Robertson Side door interrogation is quite useless because they send a can in at 2 00. and want him out at jsQG and it can't be done as a nan must be there for two or three days. Cannot limit to Drench Belgian or Dutch but records of Germans will also increase but as far as pure enemy agents are concerned have agreement to have ail German agents recruited for work in the field through LRC. Mr. Pearson A man picked up in Belgium by our mission who is to be sent back here-only for parachute training under category C and met at the airport and he would then proceed to LRC hut not turned over immediately to our school will he come to LRC first of all Lt. Col. Robertson \Ye might say to you afterwards this nan X who has been brought in and is recommended for training is a bad man and you oughtn't to take him. Mr. Pearson Jculd you consider that advisory or executive Lt. Col. Robertson As advisory. Mr. Pearson If you didn't like a person and P Section did like him  we have no. executive authority -would he then be permitted to go to the. school hy jV Ltr Coiv--R.obertson If the school insists on it. If LRC had good reasons they would say they are going to put him through the hoop. We never reject the LRC advi&e. Mr. Pearson 'There is also the question cf ultimate authority on the thing and there might be something which we considered extremely unfortunate from a security point of view in playing back a particular person japt. Tnat would be a case of discussion. 'On case we knew that man .was due to go back. Lt. Col. Robertson There are various things to do with people. Gan give them special interrogation alongside our people. That means we should have to find them special accommodations have them there for a week and pass them back to the field. Then the type cf person who goes to the LRC released after security investigation the accredited agent -and the ethers who if you get high THIS IS A COPY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION /mac run Oi IQ Rl, enough authority will be allowed through ports for special reasons. Mr. Pearson V/ould you be prepared to take the Director of OSS's assumption of authority for putting him in Mu .. . Col. Robertsons An accredited agent can be sent to ihe school and we have sent them there because after all we may have had some doubt on subsequent behavior and had reports that conflicted and put him in school until it.was cleared up. There is no obligation on our part to send an agent to school if an accre dited agent. Lt.-Gol. Robertson 'The casual people coming over must go to school. Mr. Pearson My suggestion is that when we have finished the discussion that you Colonel Robertson present me with a memorandum outlining suggested procedure and restrictions which I can take with me to i Sections concerned for their acceptance rather than some thing simply brought up to them. Lt. Col. Robertson One other point. If you bring a chap back here and he has passed through to your training.people and they find that he is unsuitable we are bound under Home Office regulations to see that that man is not allowed loose. The Home Office themselves express the view that they would much prefer that 'these people be returned to their country of origin if possible. If on the other hand they can't be returned if bad' Germans etc. then the Home Office is prepared to put them in a special internment camp until possible to return them to their country. Mr. Pearson Let's say that you picked up a Dutchman who in getting over here in LRC was not as good as we thought he was or possibly not bad himself but had friends and connections w.aieh were bad that he came over here and was rejected and it soured him would you send him back to mis around in Holland to discuss the inadequacies of SIS Lt. Col. Robertson No. Should probably apply with your permission that that man be interned here. Mr. Pearson If allowed to go back he would probably again mix with the underground group and agents giving a bad report and thus would keep other agents from wanting to come over hers. He would be a menace to our other operations. The psychological effect would be bad. Capt. . I do think on ail these cases that discussion with your people 033 is of paramount importance when you get into a pinch but if you 033 let us know the difficulty we can nearly always get you out. Lt. Gol Robertson 'fie should certainly not try to continue the present set-up. -3, Mr.'Pearsoni Tae effort lias been to cooperate and it is oach easier than it ras two or three months ago. This makes it xjossibls to discuss some thing of this sort.  Snsign Forneys I assume that when one of our agents goes through your school we will get copies of interrogation Lt. Coi. Robertson h e will pass copies to you. LSr. Pearson like one for our files and one for the security office. 7 A ' oaptl-r What we have set ourselves out to .do is to provide some Mod of security organization for unfortunate people who have got to be dropped on the other side so that their life -will be made a little easier. Especially on 30 side because they work in groups. If you .get a bad man in the whole thing .'.'ill be over. Ur. Pearson Once these'men have be.en through LRC having been picked up at Port and brought to school and have finished school what is given them at that time  Capt. They are given permission to land11 get an IE-23 and from there they have to get civilian papers -registration card an identity card and ration books. They are ail landed on condition that they register with police and do. not take up any occupation except with permission of the Ministry of labor. They must register with police because otherwise they can't eat anything except Army rations and it makes them conspicuous by the fact that police get notification of their landing and nothing comes along showing them going through the regular procedure.  We would urge it -this registration. . Ensign Forney It is best to put them right through the regular paces.  Japt. Normality is the best policy. Mr. Pearson How long would you normally say ou Ri should'expect to be held up at school Lt. 'Jo1.Robertson From four to possibly six days. uapt . a minimum of four but seldom longer than six if there is any genuine reason for their coming out. Lt. Lawler Does the interrogation at LRC dispense with cur giving them information or helping them . Lt.Col. Robertson No. Any information we can give LRC should be given as it greatly hslps them. If there is any doubt about a trace they question him  - 4   original DixuwNmW AC ', on this particular phase. He is brought into 1110 and gives name address etc. then 'trace is started /ill is arranged before the man arrives. 'The interrogators have all the information before they start interrogation. Lt. Scott Is Mr. Pearson prepared to have sufficient advance notice of an arrival Mr. Pearson We have to try to cope with that and give 130 advance notice. Lt.'Jol. Robertson It helps but isn't essential to notify them. If you don't get advance notice he will not go to LHC but will have to go to another Section and wait. Hy way of explanation to Colonel Adams who has just arrived we are discusping an agent from the field to be trained here and explaining procedure adopted between ourselves and MI-VI in these types of cases. What has been agreed isthat I will write a paper for Mr.. Pearson to put our to his people. T/e also agree that there should be a focal point here and a focal point between our Sections. Col. Adams People are coming over as civilians and all sorts of people. If coming over as military personnel they are not agents usually but are staff people who for one reason or another have been given the Army privilege and'  in that position are not held by us as agents.  / Are they all persons who have been checked vetted from the other side Mr. Pearson Most cases of employees go immediately to our security officer. z-' Lt.

The visa can be fixed on this side easi .y snough. Mr Pearson There have been a number of violations of it. uol. Adams Another problem arriving at IRC is that the French naturally are the most touchy people in the world and we had so roach trouble from the Foreign Office that now have instructions that people whose papers are in order and there is no reason to suspect them will not have to go .to the LRu. Lt.uol.Robertson 'These chaps will come under escort. uapt ... -They are warned on the otaer side that they must be given a security interrogation and they are put at ease as far as possible and in certain touchy cases. it is arranged to intercept them between Port and IRC ana take them to lunch and tell them not to worry that it is much better cover and we would much rather do it this way and they are happy about Lt.Ool. Robertson sihen people leave the country for good notification is sent to the Home Office . Uapt. when they go back papers .are returned to British and put in dead bee-aon. On ordinary cases ordinary travel we should slacken up a bit on the numberof people escorted to LRu. . 1s long as someone is coming with them they are covered by instructions from Headquarters. We should ring up D/ji' if someone is coming. Mr. Rear3on do you always know the precise airport where they are coming uol. Maras No out if they are coming from a certain destination. Dip usually have the information. If they arrive at an airport where there is not a SCO they are supposed to ring up a SCO before they get any clearance. DifF have many on their list.

'ne asked me how I proposed that the arrangements which we had discussed should be completed. We eventually agreed that I should write him a letter setting out our proposals & the gurantees which we had obtained from S.I.S. I could mark this Top Secret and he would undertake to show it only to Prestige and to Perks and would then arrange that all these cases from the Home Office angle should be dealt with solely by them. I then mentioned to him that the Americans were asking for similar facilities and told him about the Meeting which you and I  'had recently attended. This proposal worries him even more than the proposal from S.I.S. but he says that if we can come to some similar arrangement with the Americans he does not feel that the Home Office can stand in their way at any rate for the duration of the war. We agreed therefore that I should not despatch a letter to him until we had come to some definite arragement with the Americans.

As I told you in conversation I had a discussion with one of the O.S.S. officers and between us we dictated a draft reply to you. I would like however to emphasise that the reply will come to you from the Americans and that it is entirely an American reply. All I did was to endeavour to persuade them to take certain lines which I knew would be agreeable to M.I.5.'s way of thinking. At the moment of course I am not certain whether the letter will go in the form agreed yesterday or whether they will be able to persuade their operating sections the equivalent of our P. sections to comply with the procedure suggested though at least I am certain that O.S.S. X-2 will do their very best to bring this about.  My whole object in writing this letter is of course to place on record the fact that  S.I.S. cannot be officially responsible for the reply that you receive from the Americans j Naturally this letter is not for American eyes.

THIS IS A COPY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION 3 4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT 1958. rNPnvr WcN, mi a hq vmmwm Office of Strategic Services APO 4-13 Army  7 December 1944  Dear Robertson   'vj' /v. v  I much regret the delay in commenting on the minute of our meeting . of 13.11.44 for which you have my apologies. It will be I think best to reply point by point to it after which unless there are partic ular question which you might wish to discuss with me I shall hope that you will make a formal proposal of the measures to bo adopted by OSS in dealing with alien parties whom they are importing into the UK.  f ara Jlo 3. -Clearly it is desirable to establish some system which corresponds to the procedure already used by M1-&. Such a system.would naturally have to to based on a very clear definition  A Qf what constitutes an agent  1 Of wh at high ranking officer in OSS would apply for exemption from the L.R.C. in peculiar eircura   ''h . .stances  EsmJ&dJL-ws. are considering the appointment of a suitable officer to. act as the channel between you and ourselves in the same way as acts between you and M.-6  ' 4s we road this it would apply to all agent recruited 'in the field. Tliere is however a category of agent which we are now  nsing-which as far as we arc aware differs very decidedly from' any cate gory used by MI-6 These are agents who arc used for what may.beat be de  fined as individual tasks. They come to us from underground movements  and arc sent back in such circumstances that whether or not they go wrong   either by accident or treachery the nature of their work cannot implicate others and bring bout the latter's capture by the enemy . Such agents dome to the OK only for the purpose of receiving parachute training. There is of course no secret about parachute training both the methods and place where it is given are known to the enemy. We suggest that to send this.category of agent to the .L.H.C is unnecessary and w propose that  .you.should have them refuse leave to land at the .port of arrival and hand them over to us to be kept in custody. We on our part will undertake that at no tin would such individuals be left at liberty except within the confines of the training area. You will of course be notified both as to their arrival in the U.K. and their departure from it.  In circumstances when it is required to bring other  types of agents to the UK fox training or other purposes wo are ready to propone-to our operating sections that they shall not consider an agent as accredited unless we have had some six months experience of his reli, -2  abtlity whioh should enahle ua thorowihly to check o both his 'contacts and aethods of work If therefore it. is desired to bring to the UK an -agent who is not thus accredited . it is-agreed that he shall on arrival pass through the before being landed . In .eases of accredited agents they shall be entitled to exemptioa from I .K G should we so de sire it. For these we shall assume wS a.tever'responsibility may be necessai y  With the form that the security examination would take   as set out in the minutes and the handling of the reports on then . we are of course entirely in agreement Kara. Ho - -Wcrare quito prepared to arrange as far as it is pos. aible th a't any' agent who is brought to the UK for-training but who sub   proves unsuitable for work though not on grounds warranting his detention shall be returned to the country in which he was recruited. ha you yourself suggest there will.of course be.-occasions when the govermnetat of that country will not accept the ma back or will do so only   on ausb conditions that we should feel he was inadequately protected from undeserved penal measures. In those circumstances we should be prepared '-Mid -'indeed very glad. to use the special internment camp which you mention 1 It is also possible- that aa agent will turn sour ' in Tdiieh case it my-be  . felt unwise to return him to the point of origin lest hie return impede other reeruitmeBt in that area in.such cases the disposition of the bodies will perhaps beat be-settled nd hoc.  ' 1 Fare Ho. 7 -Tb-l-S point really appears to be adequately covered by ' ' what is set out in connection with Para S  '' Para Ho. 0 -We suggest that the. high ranking officer referred to in If nS -dl above should be either the Chief' of Mission Paris or London or whoever  in their absence acts for them.  iSgiste'  Para tfo 3 -It is obvious that the regulations such.as the provisions travel documents must be observed and-equally that any bodies brought over here.by ns. which are not refused leave to land and-delivered  1 to our custody must be furnished with the proper identity .documents which fcho ropulutloun prescribe shall bn held by aliens With regard to foreign.  AUied military pp.rso.imel w appreciate -that there-are difficulties in. sendln them to the J tH.C but it -is-understood that a technique has been cvoJvod which aighii be used in-exceptional circumstancesfe suggest that tho ofi iper-msntiened in vars should be instructed in this technique by  X ara H'o IQ. -Tho. importance of this is fully appreciated and every  '. eff'oi .'t. dli of course be .made to furnish iaformation in advance conearning any Individual going to the 1 11.0  'Ihis covers all. the points in the minutes but it is.perhaps desir able that we..should also specifically refer to agents of enemy nationality. It IS imderstoocl that arrangements are being discussed whereby enemy aliens..who are brought over as prospective agents can be sent to the  L.H.O. where they will only meet enemy 'aliens of their own type and not, 3 avowed Nazis and.we-naturally hopS that if this arrangeftlent matures enemy aliens reoruited by'us way also benefit by it. We appreciate howeyer that it is iinpossible for enemy aliens who prove unsuitable for worh as agents to be left at large in this country and. we therefore wish formally to express our agreement that if-such individuals cannot be returned to the place from whence they were recruited .they shall be in terned until such time as their repatriation can he effected.

I II have havehave now nownow had hadhad handed handedhanded to toto me meme the thethe  original letter from O.S.S. which I enclose together with a copy of it. I hope and indeed think that you will be able to accept what they propose. For your own information I may tell you that the text of the letter is almost word for word as I dictated it in an interview where I was asked to suggest the text of the reply but the fact wtill remains that it is they who are making the proposals and not S.I.S. whose only part in the natter has been to try and assist both sides. With regard to para number 8 I venture to doubt whether from your point of view there will be much difference between the Chief of Mission Paris and the Chief of Mssion London as I am quite convinced that London would do what was asked of them by Paris without further ado. I think dso that you must be prepared for con siderable optimism on the part of the American operating sections when considering an agent as accredited. In other words I think the phrase  some six months experience will mean the shortest possible period which can possibly be made to come within this definition.

Dear Baxter  As you are doubtless aware the Americans have been bringing over certain agents who have been refused leave to land and handed over to American custody. Such agents were only meant to come over here for parachute training and were going to be sent back on individual tasks of such a nature that they could not compromise other individuals or organisations. It was however made a condition that should the Americans desire to keep these people in the country longer than was necessary for the parachute training and to give them reasonable liberty they must first be submitted to interrogation at the L.R.G. and duly landed therefrom if security was satisfied.  They ask of course that the interrogation shall be side-door as they are afraid of a lowering of morale if they have to be kept in thw L.E.C. Tffou will be no stranger to such apprehensions which are always expressed with great fervour by everybody but as the Americans are trying very hard to get better security arrangements made -and believe me O.S.S. X.2. have no small task to perform -it would be appreciated if you coxild possibly make side-door arrangements for these four.  If you do feel able to accede to this request I suggest that when we tell the Americans that you have done so we make it clear to them that this does not establish a precedent and they cannot possibly expect sidedoor interrogations every time since other peoples' agents have not been so favoured.  Would you very kindly let me know what you can arrange as soon as possible.  Tours sincerely.  Lt.-Colonel Baxter  L.R.C., B.1. d/LBC/SF. 51/32/19 i 12 ]Xw aber i%4.

I told him however that the procedure under which they were brought here was likely to lead to sense of grievance. They had already been in this country for about six weeks and had both said that they could not understand why it was only now at the end of their training that they had suddenly been sent for security examination. I asked to urge upon the Americans the desirability of sending aliens to the L.R.C. for examination at the earliest possible moment not only in the interests of security but also in the interests of the Organisation who were  to employ them.  Both men moreover had been told by the Americans that they would only stay at the L.R.C. for two days and so they expected to be out on Saturday. I asked m to tell the Americans not to malra any definite statements of this kind in future. While every endeavour would be made to release them as soon as possible nobody could foretell exactly how long the investigation would take. Moreover an examination carried on under a great sense of urgency was rarely effective.  B.1.d/L.R.C.  73.12.44. H.J.Baxter.   hjb/jb  [P.T.OVER.    23893 Wt.51405 5529 300 000 3/43 A. K.W.Ltd.

You asked me to let you have in written form the views which I expressed at yesterday's Easel A. meeting here as to the disposal of enemy nationals brought by O.S.3. to this country for training who prove unable or onsuitable to complete their courses.  What I said is really an expansion of paragraph 7 of the document sent to you by Colonel Robertson of this department in his letter of 13th January and amounts to this -   The Home Office are prepared though reluctantly to arrange for the internment in exceptional cases of a few German nationals brought here for training if and only if. there is a serious case against them personally on security grounds . The Horae Office would not I am afraid consider the internment f trainees against whose character or loyalty to our cause there is nothing to be said hut all that has happened is that some physical disability such as breaking his leg or inability to attain the required standard has made it impossible for him to continue his course or to be of use to your organisation. The very rainiraaim case which we could ask the Rome Office to deal with by way of internment would be one in widch the individual had been ggiy partiallytrained and acquired some secret information of importance bxHrwhere there was evidence that he would be likely to disclose this information in places more dangerous than an internment camp.

In order to minimise the risk that dangerous or undesirable enenr/ aliens may gain access to the U.K. as recruits for S.ILS. or O.S.S. all such recruits shall on arrival in the U.K. be sent to the L.R.C. for interrogation and security examination. During their stay at the L.R.C. the recruits shall be known and treated as stateless aliens and no distinction in treatment shall be made between them and other aliens ordinarily accommodated at the L.it.C. save that no charge in respect of them shall fall on the Welfare Fund. The investigation of such recruits at the L.R.C. shall be couvleted as speedily as possible. 3. If after interrogation at the L.R.C. no security objection is established to their admission to the U.K. such recruits shall be landed as German subjects conditionally on their reporting to the special service responsible for their recruitment. 4. Enemy aliens recruited from P/W camps in this country by S.I.S. or O.S.S. for training as agents shall not under any conditions go to the L.R.C. 5. S.I.S. and O.S.S. have enquired whether the Home Secretary would be prepared to make orders for the internment of any eneny alien recruited by them who is unable to complete his course of training. After consultation with the Home Office the Security Service has inforaed these agencies that the Home Secretary will not consider the internment of ary such persona unless there are genuine grounds for considering him a dangerous character from the securi4 ' noint of viewJ and that the mere j, -Page Two  fact that a recruit has acquired secret information in the course of his training hut has heen unable or is considered unfit to complete his course does not constitute adequate ground for internment. S.I.S. and  O.S.S. have also heen informed that in every case where a trainee is unable to complete his course of training O.S.S. and S.I.S. shall make special endeavours to procure his return to the Continent at the earliest possible opportunity. Any enemy aliens unable to complete their courses of training shall if they cannot he returned to the Continent hej  a enlisted in the pioneer Corps or other unit of the British Amy open to eneny aliens or h given alternative employment hy S.I.S. or O.S.S or c handed over to D.P.W for internment as a p/ff in cases where there is no security or other objection to this course or failing the above alternatives   d housed and maintained in premises under the control of S.I.S. or O.S.S. until return to the Continent is possible 6. Where any eneny alien partially trained by S.I.S. or O.S.S. is found to be dangerous from the security point of view the Security Service will submit his case for internment to the Home Office. If an order for internment is made in any such case the place of internment will either be an ordinary German internment camp in the Isle of Man or the Oratory Schools. No such internees can be accommodated either at Camp 020 or Ballaquane.  February 1945., In reply state NUMBER and DATE.  Secret. T5/L5/iv/A ed 2.2.45.  V.c. 4b cl 1 45 Dear & cter.  As you know I am now dealing with the cases of quite a number of O.S.3. agents and of course they wish to see the H.P.S. reports on these individuals.  There are two ways of solving the problem of ensuring that they do see these reports. The one we should prefer would be for you to mark the copy that you normally sent to Section V with the words 0.3.3. interest . The alternative which seems to us less advisable is that you should send an extra copy of the report but there is really little to be gained by the latter because we consider it better that the sub-section of Section Y should always see the report before it goes to the Americans in case the individual lias pre viously been tied-up with 3.1.3. and has made revelations of a nature which we should not wish to confide to the Americans. I can assure  you that there are quite reasonable grounds for this latter apprehension.  Would you very kindly let me know what you are able to  arrange.  xours sincerely.  Lt.-Colonel H. J.

Dear  Thank you for your letter VSiA9/iViA e. of 2ad February referring to copies of Beporte on 0.3.S. Agents. I4y o ai view is that the better arrax aamt to adopt sould he far us to send you two copies of the Beport and for you to send one on to the Americana.  As you Know we are unbar an obligation to let the Afiericans hare copies of our Beporte on their Agents in accordance with one clause of the agreement recently made with them. I feel that this obligation would hardly be met iy sending one copy to you for you then to decide whether or not it should be shosn to tee Americans. Moreover I should have thought teat it wosaid hare been extremely inconvenient to you to have had only one copy for if you gave this one to the Americans you would have none left for your own records.  1'ours sincerely.  H.J. Baxter Lfc.Colonel CSapt.  S.I.3., In reply etats NUMBER and DATE.  Secret. 7S/19/ivA V.c. dated 2.2.45. Ch f Cd Deax-Colonel Adam You will recollect that at the conference held with 0.3.3. at which you and Robertson were present concerning the import and export of O.S.S. prospective agents it was agreed with the Americans that they should be allowed to retain certain individuals in custody they having been R.L.L. The Americans asked me recently whether in such cases it would be in order for an individual who had been so R.L.L. to move about in the streets in the custody of a U.3. Government official in civilian clothes holding an A.G.Q. card but not entitled to wear uniform and not a member of the Armed Forces. I replied that in probability I thought it most unwise but I raised the legal question 'with Hale who suggests that the Hone Office should be con sulted on the whole matter since without their agreement there is in fact no legal justification for the Americans exercising any form of custody on an individual who is physically on British territory whether or no he has been landed Hale suggested that 3.1.3. should raise the natter with the Home Office and obtain their agreement. I hope I am not being unduly optimistic if I suggest that in all probability we should all come off better if you con ferred with Perks on this matter and told him that you considered the procedure to be in the Allied interest. I submit also that it is not unreasonable fef ae suggest tMs for although you have it is true agreed to the system in order to help 0.3.3. and ourselves you are nevertheless the authority who decides what treatment an individual shall have on arrival. Would you very kindly let me know if you are able to help me out in this matter either by acting yourself or by giving me the benefit of your advice for you will be the first to agree with me that it is not always easy to persuade the Home Office to see our point of view.

Dear Baxter  It is not without some misgivings that I send you a copy of a note which I have received from the Americans. The individuals mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 have been laid on with D4a who have been asked to ensure that only the names in which they are travelling i.e.. are men tioned either at the airport to the Immigration Officer or on their R.L.L. slips.  This obviously serves3 as it were to introduce paragraph 4 about which I confess I am extremely concerned. I am also surprised and -between ourselves -a little sceptical.  I do hope that you will be able to provide me with a satisfacotry answer to these expostulations. I feel justified in pointing out to you that I have been stern to-the Americans almost to the verge of rudeness in order to' keep them fully within the bounds of our own procedure with the L.H.C. as an institution.  Cbviously therefore if there is any truth in their present allegations my position becomes somewhat critical. I have not the slightest objection to being made to look stupid in my own. identity but I take veiy grave exception to being made to annear thus as a member of M.1.6.

It is also agreed that certain individuals may be treated exceptionally as accredited agents on the certificate of Colonel Dansey.  I understand that O.S.S. accredited agents are duly cleared from a security point of view from our records. There remains the question of authorising certain individuals to be treated as accredited agents. It is important that this should only be on a high level and as these special cases may have political or other repercussions I think Colonel Dansey should be consulted and approve them before we accept them.  Can you let me have your views on this.  Yours sincerely   Signed J.H.Adam Colonel Capt.  3.I.S, -yw  In reply state NUMBER and  Secret. VS/19/48 dated 12.5.45. Dear Adai Please-refer to your SF.50/6/143/4/Y.ADD4 dated 4th May /1945. You will remember that the whole of this matter was fully discussed between representatives of O.S.S. M.I.5. and us at Ryder Street on 15.14.44. The draft of the definition of an accredited agent which we received un der reference SF.50/6/143/4/A. dated 21.12.44. was as follows 'V \ V's  Before putting forward suggestions for setting this machinery in motion it is neces sary to define the term 'accredited agent'.  In our submission an accredited agent is an agent who has been proved by his work in the field to be reliable. M.I.5. are prepared to accept as an accredited agent one who has been working for six months and is vouched for in writing by the Chief of O.S.S. Mission in Paris or in London or in the absence of either of these officials whoever is acting for them at the time.  During the discussion of this particular paragraph you will remember it was agreed that S.I.S. could not possibly undertake the responsibility for deciding the rights and wrongs of a certificate given by O.S.S. that an individual was an accredited agent. This is still the position. If you consider that the position with regard to the certificates given in writing by the Chief of the O.S.S. Mission in Paris or London should now be reconsidered may I suggest that we should have a further discussion with O.S.S. and yourselves. Yours sincerely. Colonel J.H. Adam ijh' lo K tri  M.I.5.
