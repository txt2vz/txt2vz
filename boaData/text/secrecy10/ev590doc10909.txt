I write to confirm our conversation of yesterday on the subject of the agreement recently come to between us and Colonel Donovan for collaboration between British and Merican S.O. organisations.  My understanding is that there were only two points which you would like to see amended in the agreement contained in the Record of our Discussions with Colonel Donovan's staff officers namely   i BURMA. You wished Burma to be described as a British sphere of influence into which the American S.O. would be free to work from China instead of as in the exsiting Record a no-man's land into which both the British organisation in India and the American organisation in China were free to work.  ii You wished it to be explicitly laid down in the Principles that in the allocation of territories as either exclusively or predominantly British or American the factor of Military Commands in the area in question should be the principal consideration and that the allocation of territories on this basis should be reviewed from time to time in the light of the development of the military situation. Thus for example if British forces were some day to operate in China in circumstances which might amount to this area coming under British Military Command we should have the right to claim that the present allocation by which China is to be treated as an American sphere of influence should be reviewed in our favour. It was further agreed that the procedure to be adopted in regard to any modification of the existing Record of Discussions with Colonel Donovan s staff should be as follows  As soon as we had obtained the comments of both the Foreign Office and the Chiefs of Staff on the Record we should advise our American colleagues of all the changes which were desired by our people. Colonel Donovan would presumably do the same after he had received the comments of the Chiefs of Staff and the State Department. At that stage the question would arise of drawing up an amended agreement to be accepted and signed by both parties. This opportunity would be taken to draft an agreement in a simpler and more condensed form that the existing Record.  P.T.O, In the meantime we undertook to prepare for you a simplified and consolidated statement of the conclusions embodied in the Record of Discussions and this will be sent to you as soon as possible. f P.N.

July 1942.  Eany thanks for your letter GFT/2510 of the 10th July about the agreement between yourselves and Colonel Donovan for collaboration between the British and American 3 0. organisations.  The two points which you mention in the second paragraph of your letter were I think the only two specific changes in the agreement suggested at the last Foreign Office -3.0.S. Meeting. At the same time as Sporborg and I explained to you a good many other ideas and suggestions were ventilated on both sides. Host of the discussion was however either inconclusive or of a preliminary nature due partly no doubt to the fact that it was not entirely easy to study a series of documents in which some of the later papers amended or superseded points agreed in the earlier papers. It was  therefore suggested at the end of the meeting that a    single document should be prepared for further consideration and that in the drafting of it regard should be had to the various views expressed during this preliminary discussion. When this new single document is ready it will obviously have to be considered here in detail and then discussed with you at one of our meetings and I should think it is quite likely that further amendments may then be suggested.  I do not suppose there is any misunderstanding between us on this but I think that I ought to make it clear that the points which I mentioned to you at our talk are by no means necessarily final.  BtiAOUliiiHttil, I imagine that it would probably be useful to discuss at a Foreign Office -3.0.E. meetin0 the future procedure to be adopted as between yourselves and Colonel Donovan but for what it is worth I agree with you that the procedure which you suggest in the third paragraph of your letter is probably the simplest and best.   Sd. p. m LOXLEY, INDEXED  GFT/23  28th July 1942.  Dear  t I attach hereto copies Nos. 1 2 and 3 \ of a summary in the form of an agreement of the  record of discussions between British S.O.E. and  1 \ -vvOSa -V American S.O. which took place during Colonel Donovan s visit to London.  L-Pt\ c v As you will see I have provided for the insertion of paragraphs to meet the two tr . Vt points raised by the Foreign Office in the  ' course of our conversations.  I have not included in this Summary Records Nos. 4 5 and 6 which of course you have already but which are not concerned with matters of interest to the Foreign Office.  As a matter of interest I might mention that we have received a telegram from New York advising us that the agreement attached as an addendum to Agreement No.5 has not been approved by the American authorities and that they have counter proposals to make.

FOLLOWING FOR LOUIS FRANCK From Colonel Taylor. 1 Further to our 2973 vie have now received telegram from Lord Glenconner QUOTE Telegram received from Cairo No.0795/0796 of 31.8.42. UNQUOTE 2. We fully appreciate your desire not to make protest to Colonel Donovan on basis of London agreement unless absolutely necessary but we feel situation regarding American organisation in the Middle East is now reaching really dangerous phase and must be cleared up. Therefore think you should approach Colonel Donovan to secure definite application of London agreement regarding Middle East or if you consider this inadvisable for tactical reasons at least to ensure that no action contrary to London agreement or compromising our ultimate control in this area should be taken. 3. We greatly fear that unless a definite ruling is agreed with Colonel Donovan and issued by him to his people both in Washington and in Cairo we will shortly wake up to find that American'S.O.E. representatives in Middle East have actually established relations with Allied or other elements in Middle East which it will then be impossible to eliminate and which /ill cause unending confusion. 4. We also fully appreciate the points made in your 06926 arising from fact that London agreement has not formally beoi ratified by either side. For action suggested in paras 2 & 3 above we think you can rely upon moral obligation on Colonel Donovan to act in accordance with agreement pending formal ratification. At the same time we have taken up urgently with Foreign Office need for immediate authority to ratify without any, amendment at all and we are reasonably confident we shall get this authority within next 48 hours. We shall also get formal letter from Chiefs of Staff suitable for exchange by you with Colonel Donovan., COPY  CIPHER TELEGRAM DESPATCHED IQ MET YORK- 25. 8. 42.  2918 2920 and 2921.  Following for Col. Franck from Mr. Keswick  K Generally very little progress has been made in carrying out provisions of agreement chiefly because Colonel Donovan's organisation apparently remains in embryo condition both at Headquarters and in the Field.  B. Colonel Donovan's representatives here have never discussed with us again this agreement and we still await Colonel Donovan's confirmation and ratification which he promised after submission to A and State Department. C. lie have submitted agreement to our own Chiefs of Staff and to Foreign Office. Former have given blessing which is rather vague but which definitely authorises us to go ahead with execution of the agreement. Foreign Office have so far suggested only two very minor amendments. Firstly description of Burma as British sphere into which O.S.S. free to work from China instead of as No-Man's land. Secondly more explicit provision that allocation of spheres open to review in light of development of military situation. Foreign Office advise us they have some further minor suggestions to make but we can safely assume no material change will be proposed. D. 1. S.0.para-military activities in B. have almost been reduced to nothing more due to C opposition than to policy of handing over to Colonel Donovan. 2. Our other S .0. activities are almost wholly confined to R.I.I. and until Colonel Donovan decides on his set up in B. presumably after B's report it is surely unwise to contemplate still further reduction as at present there is virtually ho Colonel Donovan organisation in B. with which to liaise. 3. Whatever organisation Colonel Donovan is eventually able to set up in B. we do not contemplate withdrawing our secret support of the C secret organisation centred in R.I.I. in which E is also interested but on S.O. para-military side we will submit to lead of Colonel Donovan and will set up liaison specially in regard to stores and co-operation with our P. T.C, 2  Mission in F. from where it has been agreed Colonel Donovan should not operate.  4. Lt.Col. John Keswick can fully explain situation. E. Position regardind Cape Yerde is still as indicated in our telegram We fully recognise that we have no right under agreement to establish representative at Cape Yerde except as Liaison Mission with American Mission. We would however like you to put it to Colonel Donovan that the Foreign Office are appointing vice Consul to Cape Yerde and have given us the chance of nominating a man. Ks it would clearly be in interest of both organisations that British Yice Consul in Cape Yerde should be S .0. . minded we would like his permission to go ahead with scheme. When his own Mission is established in Cape Yerde Vice Consul could carry out liaison duties provided for in agreement. Please telegrapl Colon l Donovan's reaction as soon as possible.  F. Since Colonel Donovan has not yet so far as we know got Missions in any other Atlantic islands we are not making any plans for appointing further liaison missions in this area at present. G. We are obtaining necessary information from Cairo and will telegraph again as quickly as possible.

It may of course be that there is some secret understanding between Captain Robert Low and 'Washington. My impression is that Capt. Robert Low believes in trying to get on by getting things done. Hence though he is on his own admission in reality only liaison officer attached to this mission he is initiating plans of his own on strength of information he learns from us and other sources and his contact with General Brereton. He then telegraphs Washington for necessary equipment and personnel. B. Trouble is that though he appears quite willing to cooperate with us he professes to be ignorant of terns of our agreement with American S.0. and states he has had no instructions regarding it. C. He sees no reason therefore why he should not get busy in Greece and Turkey as well. In this regard he tells me he has two assistants one of whom he is now proposing to send to Turkey to investigate and the other to Cyprus. D. I am prepared to regard this as harmless for the present for unless he is playing doublegame or breaks faith with me he will not do anything without my knowledge and consent. E. It is clear that this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue and that his principals must either appoint him as head of American Mission advising him of terms of our agreement and instruct him to negotiate with me or tactfully tell him he should submit to my authority until real Head of Mission arrives. This latter wmld be most preferable. F. It is breach of agreement and unfair on Capt. Robert Low if his principals encourage him in his projects without giving him necessary status and keeping him in ignorance of true position. G. He also points out that a is soon to come here as Head of Mission with his own assistants several Arabs fourteen Yugoslavs and ten Greek agents recruited and trained in United States during last three months. This would not seem to tally with out previous information or that in your telegram to the effect that a is still preparing his own instructions. H. Finally De Chastelaine has reported B and C are now in Istanbul and seem to be dealing with S.O.E. matters. Capt. Low denies having anything, to do -with them and suggest they are maubers of American War Information Department. I would be glad if you 7sould confim this with V/ashington.

TELEGRAMS 701/2 CAIRO TO LONDON WERE QUOTED VERBATIM WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS  We had however previously heard from - ord Gienconner regarding the aircraft pos.'Ion for S.O.E. Middle East. Lord Gienconner points out that cardinal factor is that Wellingtons from bomber pool can be used for brief sorties but sorties to Jugoslavia can only be undertaken by Liberators specially adapted so that they cannot be used for other operations. Consequently A.O. C.-in. C. is not in favour of Americans using their Liberators for sorties to the Balkans. Further more A.O. c.-in-c believes that Americans could only get aircraft as a political stunt and on strength of our using them for Jugoslavia. He would not therefore look on Colonel Donovan s machines as extra to total number in Middle East but as a deduction from number that would otherwise be available for routine operations. We agree with Lord Gienconner's telegram and suggest that you get Colonel Donovan to telegraph to Captain Robert Low to the effect that he should submit to Lord Gienconner's authority until real Head of Mission arrives. Furthermore that Captain Robert Low must not repeat not initiate any plans without Lord Glenconner's approval.  We also view with some anxiety the suggestion that Americans should drop their own personnel to Mihajlovic particularly in view of the Jugoslav Army crias in Egypt where Mirkovic and other rebel officers are only .too likely to play off British and Americans.

Colonel Taylor S 0. E. I write to confirm my telephone message to you of September 2nd that my Secretary of State agrees that you should ratify your draft agreement with Colonel Donovan without amendment. You know already of two of the points which we here made namely that about Burma and that about the basic principle on which areas should be allocated to yourselves or to the Americans. The other two comments which have since been made here are as follows   l The section relating to East Africa describes your mission at Durban as being charged with working into Madagascar and Portuguese East Africa . This description strikes us as somewhat inaccurate since in fact your mission is only authorised to use Portuguese East Africa as a base for work in Madagascar and for watching Axis agents. As East Africa is laid down in the agrasment as being a British area and as Colonel Donovan s organisation have no more than the right to attach a liaison mission to your people at Durban there should be no fear of the Americans engaging in any independent activities in Portuguese East Africa. You may hov/ever think it . C A l //i/ tr ry y wise as and when opportunity offers toN-aat misunderstanding/, misunderstanding with the Americans by   making it clear to them that the activities of your mission at Durban are in fact circumscribed within narrower limits than the wording of your agreement with Colonel Donovan would seem to imply.  2 The comment has also been made here that it seems anomalous that the Canaries should fall within Colonel Donovan's sphere of activity when this is still a British military responsibility. On the other hand we regard it as being to our general advantage that the Americans rather than ourselves should be responsible for underground activities in Portuguese and Spanish territory. This is not a view which requires to be communicated to the Americans but you may like to have it on record and to communicate it to Louis Prank for his own confidential information. NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN., NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. Minutes-   SECRET.  With the entry into the field of Colonel Donovan's American S.O.E. organisation it became urgently necessary that our own S.O.E. should negotiate a working agreement with them in order to avoid duplication and the crossing of wires to say nothing of American interference in areas of vital concern to ourselves.  Accordingly when Colonel Donovan was in London last June S.O.E. negotiated a draft agreement with him ad referendum. This agreement is summarised in the attached paper. The agreement goes into great detail and lays down the basis of S.0.E.-Colonel Donovan collaboration in all parts of the world. In so far as .it is capable of being further summarised its main provisions are as follows   1 S.O.E. will maintain a liaison mission in Washington and Colonel Donovan will maintain a similar mission in London in order to secure uniformity of policy and operation.  2 In order to avoid competing operations in different parts of the world the main areas in which the two organisations work have been divided up -and defined as being either American or British areas. In an American area the control and direction of all subversive work whether by Colonel Donovan's organisation or by S.O.E shall be conducted from Washington in a British area control shall be exercised from London. Colonel Donovan may have his own missions in British areas but they must work under the direction of the head local S.O.E. representative. Similarly S.O.E. may have missions in American areas but they must accept American control.  3 In the light of the foregoing principle the main areas in question have been parcelled out as follows - British areas. American areas. Joint areas.  which may be India. China. v/orked into East Africa. Australia. as convenient  West Africa. Atlantic by either  Middle East Islands. organisation  including Finland. Balkans . North Africa. Burma Thailand Indo china. Malaya. Sumatra.  Footnote. American missions will however be established in this area in agreemelit with S.O.E. in order to enable Colonel Donovan's organi ation to undertake subversive operations on behalf of the U. . High Command should the occasion arise .   Footnote Colonep. Donovan's organisation will also establish a mission in Cairo but it will take no action except with the approval of the lead local representative of S.O.E., , Nothing to be Written in this Margin. Minutes. S.O.E. have submitted the agreement to the Foreign Office for approval. It has now been seen by all Departments concerned and though a number of comments have been made none of them are of great importance and I do not think that I need 'trouble you with them. S.O.E. are now anxious to bring the agreement into force forthwith mainly in order to be able to exercise control over Colonel Donovan's representative in the Middle East. If we put forward amendments on our side it is more or less certain that the Americans will put forward others on theirs. Agreement will thus be retarded and the final text may not even be so good from our point of view as the present one. ' i bJu. n Tiro While fe-hn'efui e there io a certain cmrom t in this agreement that we don't much like I would recommend    l that we should inform S.O.E. that \ie approve the present text without modification and  2 that we should inform S.O.E. of the comments which have been made here and ask them to raise them with Colonel Donovan as and when opportunity offers. 1st September 1942  7 D/jn 1 K. /fa see/ &, Minutes.

I am now writing to Colonel Taylor reminding him of points i and iv in my minute of September 1st of which S.O.E. are already aware and informing him of points ii and iii . There is nothing really to be said to the Americans about point iii and I am not putting point v to Colonel Taylor at all as I do not think that it would do any practical good.

Hambro.  Reference your letter of 26th June and subsequent correspondence about joint Anglo-American S. 0. E. collaboration  The Chiefs of Staff are desirous that S.O.E. should collaborate with the Americans in so far as the security of British Secret Service interests permit with the object of ensuring unification of policy. The Chiefs of Staff are I am sure. prepared to leave it to S.O.E. to agree with the Americans the necessary machinery to give effect to the necessary collaboration bearing in mind that the interests of His Majesty's Government throughout the world are of first importance., Mimites-  NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN.  r-rVion T S.O.E. have submitted their agreement' to the Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office for approval. The former had no special comments to make. The Foreign Office Departments concerned have now studied the agreement in detail and the following are the main comments-which have emerged   i It would be better if Burma were treated as a British and not as a joint area though Colonel Donovan's organisation would have to be given the right to work into it from China. TV 5  ii British Mission in East Africa is-wrongly described as vrorking into Portuguese East Africa in fact S.O.E. are only allowed to use Portuguese East Africa as a base for work in Madagascar and for watching Axis agents.  iii It seems anomalous that the Canaries should fall within Colonel Donovan's sphere of activity when this is still a British military responsibility. On the other hand it is to our general advantage that the Americans rather than ourselves should be responsible for underground activities in Portuguese and Spanish territory. - ivVl-t would seem desirable to state explicitly somewhere in the agreement that in allocating an area to the British or the American organisation regard has primarily been had to the nationality of the Allied Commander-in-Chief in the area in question and that the present allocation is subject to review in the light of military developments.  v 'C' further tells me that he is disturbed at the lengths to which S.O.E. seem prepared to go in sharing their secrets with Colonel Donovan. The latter are bound to learn much about S.O.E. methods which have in fact been largely copied from S.I.S. and there is consequently a serious risk that many of C's own secrets will eventually leak out. He appreciates however that things have gone too far for it to be possible to draw back now. S.O.S. have now informed us a That the American Chiefs of Staff have approved the agreement as it stands.  b That if we attempt to revise it the Americans are very likely to suggest certain counter modifications on their side and that the final outcome of any fresh discussions might well lead in the opinion of the head S.O.S. representative in New York to an agreement less favourable to/, Minutes. to ourselves than the present one.   c The head S.O.E. representative in the Middle East has telegraphed to say that Colonel Donovan's I epresentative there professes to know nothing of any agreement between his organisation and S.O.E. and is preparing to go ahead with a number of operations on his own. In the view of S.O.E. it is therefore urgently desirable to bring the agreement into force at once in order that the activities of Colonel Donovan's representative in the Middle East may be controlled in the manner laid down in the agreement. I think that there is considerable force  in S.O.E's arguments as reproduced above. None of our own comments are very substantial  and while there is admittedly a good deal in  the agreement that Y/e do not much like I am inclined to think that it is as good a one as we are likely to get and that if we reopen it we may easily fare worse rather than better. Moreover unless the Americans are tied down to a hard and fast agreement they are sure to indulge in a free for all scramble which may be highly embarrassing to us in areas such as the Middle East where our interests predominate. I believe therefore that our wisest policy is to endorse the agreement forthwith without reservation.  A  f NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN., inoexbo  GFT/70. 1st September 1942.  S. . .

Further to our telephone conversation of this afternoon I send you herewith copies of telegrams exchanged with Cairo and New York showing how the position regarding the Agreement with Colonel Donovan has become more and more acute until it is now evident that the sooner we clinch the deal the better.  As you agreed with me on the telephone this can best be done by authorising our Liaison Fission in Washington to exchange ratifications with Colonel Donovan's neoole without raising any amendments at all. The American Joint Chiefs of S aff have approved the London Agreement without amendment and this offers us the chance to get the whole thing signed sealed and delivered before any of Colonel Donovan's people can attempt to wriggle out of it. In our opinion any delay and above all any proposals for amendment on our part which would inevitably give rise to further discussion of the Agreement as a whole would be most dangerous.  The need for the earliest possible ratifxatlon is of course best illustrated by the Middle Eastern position where it is absolutely essential that Colonel Donovan should give clear Instrxictions to his people both in Washington and in the field within the next week or so if independent action by Captain Low in Cairo and the despatch of Hoskin's Mission from Washington are to be avoided. I see little chance of such Instructions being given unless the London Agreement is ratified and brought into immediate operation.  P. Loxley Esq.

SECP  LONDON  9th September 1942.   CH/2398.  My dear Colonel  On your last visit to London in early June this year we both agreed and initialled a record of discussions between our officers which resulted in an agreement for the co-operation of  O.S.S and' S.O.E throughout the world on the understanding that this agreement would not come formally into force until it had been submitted to and approved by United States Joint Chiefs of Staff and the State Department on the one hand and the British Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office on the other.  I am happy to be able to advise you that I have received formal confirmation from both our Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office that they are agreeable to the arrangement reached in June coming into force as a binding agreement with no amendments of any sort I understand your authorities have taken up a similar attitude.  I therefore suggest that by an exchange of letters such as this one of mine to you and a confirmatory reply from you if you are in agreement tjie June agreement should be formally ratified between us and come into full operation immediately.  The agreement in its original form is not a very convenient one for reference consisting as it does of a record of day-to-day discussions in which the conclusions of one day are sometimes modified by the decisions of the nett. I have therefore had my people get out and attach hereto 6 copies of a consolidated version which whilst retaining the exact language of the original eliminates those parts of any discussion subsequently modified by  further conversations and which if you agree could be accepted by  both of us as the governing document for future reference.

Sincerely yours   SGD. WILLIAM J. DONOVAN.  Sir Charles Hambro  We both understand that we both are always subject to any amendments made by our respective Chiefs of Staff.  Sgd. DONOVAN., 3ui .ry of /.grsement between BRITISH S.0.5. and AM3RICMS.0. The following is a fairly full summary of the agreement reached in the course of discussions between officers of the British S.O.E. and the American S.O. between the 16th and 22nd June 1942 This agreement was confirmed by Sir Charles Hambro on the one side and Colonel Donovan on the other on the under standing that it would be submitted by the former to the British Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office and by the latter to the American Chiefs of Staff at the State Department for their approval. The principles on which this Agreement are based are as follows  1. Co-operation at Headquarters London/Wnshington The object of such co-operation is to achieve a common policy and to avoid crossing of lines in regard either to policy or to the supply of materials. For this purpose close liaison between headquarters is essential. This liaison will be effected by a British liaison section working alongside Colonel Donovan s headquartersin Washington and a similar American liaison section working alongside S.O.E. Headquarters London. The duties of this liaison section would bc -  To represent the views of their respective headquarters on all policy matters so that a common policy for every theatre can be decided on. To discuss with the headquarters to which they have been accredited cases of dispute in the field which have been referred to that headquarters. c To exchange information and to keep thoir headquarters fully informed of matters of interest. d To co-ordinate the production demand and supply of equipment from British and U.S. sources. e To exchange both operational and technical in telligence and information on methods of training. Such a liaison section might consist of one head liaison officer who would be a high level representative charged with executive functions supported by requisitestaff. --I, 2. C0-OP JR/iTIOH IN THS FIELD It is essential to avoid the situation where there will he two completely independent organisations working in the field with all the consequent dangers of crossing of linos competition for agents and material etc. and inviting attempts by foreign governments or groups with whom both organisations would be dealing to play one off against the other.  In some cases the problem will be dealt with by assigning a given region exclusively either to the American or British organisation the organisation v/hich agrees to stay out being represented at the most only by a liaison officer and a small staff  There will however be vory few of those simple cases and in most areas the position will be that whilst an area is pre dominantly a British or American sphere of influence both countrie will have some interests inside it and will need to establish some sort of representation and possibly a system of agents.  It is agreed that the general principles to bo adopted in such cases should be  a Each area should be defined as being either a British or American area.   To be inserted at the request of the Foreign Office It is understood that in allocating an area predominantly cither to the British or American organisation a main consideration will be the system of military command pre vailing in the area in question. Thus normally where the local command is American the area will -unless some special over-riding consideration applies -be allocated to American S.O. whore the command is British the allocation will be to the British S.O.E.  It is further undorstood that such allocation will be re viewed in the light of any development in the military situation thus a change in command from American to British or vico versa will be followed by a corresponding change in the allocation of the area.  b Inside a British area it will be agreed that the control and direction should bo British and that the policy should be laid down and all instructions to the Mission or Missions in that area should bo issued from London In an American area the same procedure would apply as regards Washington.  c In the field in a British area there would bo a British Mission the head of which would be Controller for the whole area and who would look for his direction and instructions to London. If the Americans so wished there could bo an American Mission in the same territory v/hich would have its own headquarters its own stations and its own agents but the American Mission and its head at those headquarters would work under the direction and control of the British con troller. The head of the American Mission could report direct to Washington on any matter he wished with a copy to the American liaison mission in London but he would receive his instructions from London and through the British controller and would only act on communications received direct from Washington with the agreement and consent of the British controller. In an American territory the same principle would apply with the roles reversed.  d In the event of a difference of opinion arising between the British or American controller and the head of the British, or Amoricon Mission inside his territory which could not  he settled locallyf the issue would he referred to London  or Washington respectively5 and it would he the responsi   hility of the headquarters in question to settle it with  the liaison mission attached to it.  Even these rather general principles may not he able to he applied strictly in all cases and it may he nec essary to make exceptions in certain countries to meet special requirements.  It was agreed that the following areas could he allocated in accordance with the foregoing principles without raising any very serious problems.  1. INDIA It was agreed that India should he regarded as a British area where all operations would he carried out hy the British Mission with control being exorcised from London. The American S.O. would have the right to send out a liaison mission to ho attached to the British Mission for liaison purposes hut not for operational purposes.  2. CHINA It was agreed that this area of which the headquarters would he at Chungking and which cover the whole of China in cluding Japanese-occupied China Manchuria and Korea should he regarded as an American sphere of influence. The American Mission would he established at Chungking and would direct all S.O. activities in this area. It would he controlled from Washington. The existing British Mission at Chungking would he reduced and would he turned into a liaison mission attached to the American Mission. The British liaison mission in addition to its liaison duties would render any assistance which it could to the American Mission hut only at the latter's request and under the latter's control.  3. AUSTRALIA It was agreed that British S.O.E. would have no res ponsibility for and would take no action in the area covered hy General MacArthur's Command and that of the American Naval Command in the South Western Pacific. This area would he considered as covering Now Guinea and the islands of the East Indian archipelago up to and including Java and Borneo. It would he for the American S.O. to make its own arrangements with the I.S.D. which already exists in Australia under General MacArthur's control. British S.O.E. would continue to give any assistance asked for to this Mission.  4. To ho inserted at the request of the Foreign Office BURMA  It was agreed that Burma should ho a British area hut that American S.O. should have the right to work into it as convenient from China.  5. SIAM. INDO-CHINA MALAYA AND SUMATRA It was agreed that those areas should he regarded as a no-man's-land which could he worked into as convenient hy the British S.O.E. Mission in India the American S.O. Mission in China and. I.S.D. in Australia. Line crossing inside this, nrcn would hove to Tdc avoided by close liaison betwoon these three missions.  6. EAST AFRIC/i It was agreed that the area covered by the British S.O.E. Mission which already exists with its headquarters at Durban charged v/ith working into Madagascar and Portuguese East Africa should bo regarded as a British area American S.O. would have the right to have a liaison mission attached to  the British Mission at Durban.  7. WEST AFRICA'. -PRAV.'EST and NEUGOLS Whilst it was agreed that the area covered by these two existing British S.O.E. Missions -namely the West African colonics from the southern boundary of Morocco to the boundary of South West Africa with Portuguese West Africa -should for the time being be regarded as predominantly a British sphere it was recognised that the American S.O. had a very definite interest in this area since if any military action on a large scale were to be undertaken by the United Nations in West Africa such action would predominantly be the responsibility of the American military authorities. The American S.O. therefore consider that they must place themselves in a position to be able to carry out S.O. services for the American Command if such a situation should arise. The following procedure was accordingly agreed upon.  American S.O. would establish Missions corresponding to our Prawost and Neucols Missions. The programme of these American Missions would be worked out in as much detail as possible between Washington and London. Copies of this agreed programme would then bo sent to the Heads of the American Missions and the Heads of the British Missions with clear instructions in both cases that the execution of this programme by the American Missions would be discussed step by step with the Heads of the British Missions and no action taken until agree ment had been reached with them. If such agreement could not be arrived at the point at issue would bo referred to headquarters to be settled between London and Washington and until decision was given no action would be taken by the American Missions It was con templated that the programme which would be worked out between London and Washington for these American Missions would be essentially preparatory in character consisting of the placing of American representatives at appropriate points the establishment of dumps of materialsthe collection of information and operational intelligence and the working out of plans against appropriate targets.  It was agreed that as had already been arranged with the Minister Resident the situation in West Africa would as regards him be analagous to that existing in Cairo and that the Head of the British Mission in West Africa would act as the link between any American Mission and the Minister Resident putting up to the latter the requirements of the American Mission and convoying to them the decisions of the Minister Resident  8. ATLANTIC ISLANDS It was agreed that these islands comprising the Azores Madeira the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands should be regarded as an American sphere and operated by an American Mission controlled from Washington. The British S.O.E would have the right to attach liaison officers to the American, organisation.  9. FINLAND It v/as agreed that Finland should ho regarded as an American sphere and that the British S.O.E. should place all facilities and contacts useful for this country at the disposal of their American colleagues  10 RUSSIA  S.O.E.5 having explained the position regarding their liaison mission in Moscow and their agreement with the N.K.V.D. that neither party would carry out any operations in the territory of the other except hy mutual arrangement it was agreed that as the American S.O. had no intention for the present at least of dealing with Russia there was no need to work out any arrangements for collohoration for this area. A more detailed agreement was come to in regard to the following areas which present somov/hat complicated problems.  1 . BALKANS and THE MIDDLE EAST It was agreed that in view of the fact that all Military Commands in this area were British Commands that the principal political authority was the British Minister of State at Cairo and that the whole of the territorsr other than Turkey -within which and from which operations could take place or he based -was wholly or partially under British military occupation the area at present covered by the British  S.O.E. with its headquarters at Cairo should be regarded as predominantly a British area. ' At the same time it was appreciated that there were many ways in which the.American S.O. could be of groat assistance in this area. It could call upon resources in regard to equipment materials and possibly personnel which were not available to the British S.O.E. and in certain area -for example Turkey and Iran - American personnel could in some respects operate more easily than British personnel. It was accordingly agreed that the set-up should be as follows -   The controller of the existing British S.O.E. Mission would be regarded as being in charge of all S.O.E operations in that area and would be responsible for all S.O.E. activity to the local authorities -particularly the S.O.E. Sub-Committoo of the Minister of State's War Council -and to headquarters in London. An American S.O. Mission should be set up in Cairo with the object of providing such assistance as it could to the British S.O.E and of contributing to the British  S.O.E. services which would only be available from the American side. The form and extent of the organisation of the American Mission and also the scope and character of its activities would be discussed and settled by the Head of the American Mission with the British Controller under whom ho would be working. In the event of failure to roach agreement the issue would be referred to headquarters to be settled between London and Washington and in the meantime the views of the Controller would prevail. The Hoad of the American Mission would communicate direct with Washington on any matter he pleased but it would be clearly laid down that as regards any action the American Mission would look to the Controller for direction and instructions and would take no action except with, -6  i.ls npprovol.  With regnrd to ouch cor.raunicotions hety/een V/ashington ond the Head of the inericnn Mission in Cniroj it was agreed that all such telegrams -whether originating from Washington or Cairo -should he repeated to the American Mission attached to S.O E. London. It was also agreed that it would he the responsibility of the American Mission in London to Iceep British S.O.E. informed as to the content of all such messages which affect British interests. It was agreed that if the American Mission set up their own War Station in Cairo it would he used only for communications with Washington as the  War Station belonging to S.O.E. Mid-East is already adequate for handling all communications with agents in the field.  The substantial effect of this arrangement would be that there would be a single S.O.E. machine in the area at the head of which would bo the present Controller but that under him there would be two organisations namely the existing British S.O.E. organisation covering the whole area of the Mission and a small American organisation which would be fitted by the Controller into the general programme wherever it could help.  In regard to the question of supplies of equipment from America to S.O.E. Mid-East it was pointed out that such equipment comes under two categories namely  a Scrvico equipment including aircraft naval craft arms ammunition medical stores building materials transport parachutes containers clothing and field telephones and  b Non-Service specialised equipment including explosives sabotage devices W/T sets War Station and broadcasting equipment etc.  With regard to the former it was pointed out that S.O.E. is the British Government department created for waging subversive warfare but that the G-in-C Mid-East is responsible for all operations in that theatre of war. S.O.E. plans must therefore conform to C-in-C's operational requirements and to the strategic requirements of the Chiefs of Staff They arc therefore submitted to C-in-C for his concurrence ond in carrying them out S.O.E. are acting as his agents.  It was remarked that this machinery has been set up to enable the combined Chiefs of Staff to pool the resources of the United States and Great Britain and allocate them to the various theatres of war having regard also to transport facilities. It was accordingly agreed that it will therefore be impossible for S.O.E. Mid-East to make direct application to the American S.O. for equipment of this typo. It was con sidered however that if the American S.O. can become possessed of aircraft scacraft etc. it might be possible for them to send them to their own Mission in the Middle East and place them at the disposal of the British S.O.E. organisation. In doing this however it would be necessary for the American S.O. to send their own crews and spares etc. so that the aircraft could be serviced as an independent unit and it is clear that even this plan would involve negotiations with the military authorities in Egypt. Nevertheless it was agreed that S.O.E. London should make up a list of equipment in this category of which they stand in need and supply it to the American S.O.  Regarding Non-Scrvice equipment it was pointed out that the British S.O.E. arc themselves manufacturing all their own special devices and W/T sots. At the same time it was agreed, 7  that there v/as a shortage of certain types of W/T sots and  broadcasting equipment Accordingly it was agreed that  S.O.E. London should make up a list of their requirements under this heading and supply it to the American S 0. and it was agreed that so far as this equipment was concerned there could be no objection to the American S.O. either Despatching it to their American Mission in the Middle East or  b supplying it direct to S.O.S. Mid East.  Regarding personnel it v/as explained that there is believed to be a shortage of 7/T operators in the Middle East and that it would be useful that if say 10 trained 7/T operators could bo attached to the American Mission for work in the S.O.E. Mid East War Station near Cairo. It was also pointed out that S.O.E Mid East to-day recruits the majority of its Greek 'and Jugoslav personnel from their respective armies and that it was desirable to obtain nationals of those two countries and of Bulgaria Romania and Hungary from other quarters. Such personnel should be trained as W/T operators and as expert organisers for infiltration into occupied   countries where they can assist friendly elements to organise passive resistance sabotage and revolt.  2. WESTERN EUROPE It was agreed that in any attempt to arrive now at arrangements for co-operation in this sphere it was necessary to take into account the distinction between countries likely  to be invaded by the Allied forces and those not likely to be so immediately affected and also to allow for at least two distinct phases in the development of the situation set out below.  On this basis the following detailed agreement was reached.  A. INVASION SPHERE This sphere covers Norway Holland Belgium and Prance.  Arrangements for collaboration v/ould have to go through at least two phases of which only the first could be discussed in detail at the present time. This first phase would be one in which tho British S.O.E. v/ould continue very much as it is at present working both on the development and operation of a field force of agents in each of the countries concerned and on the building up of an S.O.E. liaison organisation for attachment to the appropriate Military Commands to accompany them to the Continent whilst the American S.O. concentrated on preparatory work at the same time giving such assistance as they could to the British.S.O.E. in its task of operating the field force abroad. This phase would end as soon as the stage was reached when the question arose of an S.O.E. liaison organisation attached to an American Command taking over the actual operation of a field force abroad.  FIRST PHASE  a Organisation in tho Field  It was agreed that it was essential that tho field force in each of tho four countries concerned should continue to be treated as one whole the object being to create throughout the area likely to be invaded by Allied Forces a single, 8  United Nations Fifth Golnmn organisation to ho at the disposal of the Allied invading force -whether American or British. This would mean in practice that the American S.O. Mission in England would not with the exception of the case referred to at the end of this paragraph put agents of their own into these countries who would function separately from the existing field force and who would he operated separately hy them from a London If agent personnel were available from American sources it would he treated exactly like agent personnel available from other sources and infiltrated hy the existing headquarter organisation into the appropriate country to work as part of the one existing field force'there. In effect during this first phase there would he no change in the character or method of operation of the field force abroad the American S.O. simply contributing such assistance as they could in regard to personnel equipment facilities intelligence etc. The typo of assistance particularly envisaged hy the British S.O.E. representatives was passports air transport and assistance regarding dollar transactions.  The exception referred to above is the case of American representation at Vichy. It was appreciated that as long as the United States retain diplomatic relations with the Vichy Government it was possible for the American S.O. to havew an organisation based on their diplomatic mission inside Vichy France and in fact they have made all arrangements to establish such representation. It was further recognised that American S.O. representatives in Vichy would inevitably make contacts and create though perhaps not on a large scale a. system of agents. It was agreed that such a field force should not as far as could at present be seen have any direct connection with the normal S.O.E. field force in France. At the same time to avoid confusion it was agreed that  i this Vichy organisation would be operated by the American Mission in London and not by Washington direct and  ii that the S.O Mission in London would operate in closest collaboration and in accord with the general direction of the British S.O.E. French Region.  b Liaison Organisation  It was agreed that the American S.O. would concentrate primarily upon the recruitment and training of liaison staff v/hich would eventually be attached to the American Commands in order to provide for the latter S.O. services in the areas in which they would be operating. It was envisaged that the American S.O. would recruit this personnel in the United States give them preliminary training there and then send them to England for further training. Such recruitment and training would of course be the responsibility of the American S.O. but the British S.O.E. would place all training facilities in England at their disposal-. The American S.O would of course only require to recruit liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands with qualifications for operating in those countries which would be invaded by American forces. It was considered probable that a sufficiently definite indication of these countries could be obtained at an early date. As soon as such indication had been given British S.O.E. would.cease  to recruit and train liaison personnel for those countries which had been allocated to American Commands.  At least a certain proportion of the American S.O. liaison personnel would have to bo given as part of their training an, -9   intimate knowledge of the field organisation with which they would have eventually to work and this could only he done hy training them in the country sections concerned at British  S.O.E. Headquarters. SECOND PHASE  This phase would commence as indicated above when not only had there been a definite indication between British and American forces but when also the American S.O. liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands had been more or less completely organised and the question arose as to whether they ought not to take over the operation of the field force in the areas in which they were going to function. It was agreed that it would be impossible at this stage to lay down arrangements to cover this contingency since so much would depend upon factors v/hich are at present unknown e.g. the actual allocation of the Commands the imminence of the invasion itself etc.  Thus if Norway were allocated to the United States Forces it would be comparatively simple once they had reached the   necessary stage of development for the American S.O. liaison organisation attached to the American Command for this area to take over the operation of the field force in Norway absorbing for the purpose as much as was necessary of the country section which had hitherto been running it. On the other hand it would almost certainly be impracticable to split up the control of the field organisation in the area comprising the Low Countries and France since not only would the field force in France form a whole which could not be divided between two separately controlling headquarters in London but also the activities of the field force throughout this area once the invasion had started would be of more or less equal importance to all parts of the Allied Line except in the areas immediately behind the actual fighting. For example sabotage activities in the area of Liege of Luxembourg or of Chalons could be equally useful to British forces fighting in the Low Countries and North-Eastern France or American forces fighting in the region of Rouen or Amiens. A good deal will obviously depend upon the form of military command eventually    established and it might be found that if the supreme Command headquarters for the whole area were established in England the concentration of the whole S.O. Headquarters with that Command would be the best solution. It was accordingly agreed that the way in which the control of the field force v/hich during the first phase would be concentrated in the British S.O.E. Head quarters should be allocated between the British and American organisations and would have to be v/orked out gradually as the situation clarified. B. NON-INVASION SPHERE This sphere covers such countries as Germany Italy Switzerland Poland Czechoslovakia and Sweden The con clusions reached regarding the way in which collaboration should be effected in these areas can conveniently be set out under the three following headings  Poland and Czechoslovakia  In regard to these tv/o countries the secret armies and other underground resistance organisations are operated by the Governments of the countries concerned so the role of S.O.E. v/hether British or American will continue to be essentially that of providing them with all possible assistance. It was, -10-.  recognised thnt the British S.O.E. hove nlrondy hcon working for a considorahlotime on the joh of assisting Poles and Czechs and co-ordinating their activities with the strategic policy laid down hy the Chiefs of Staff Committee and that at any rate for some time to come the role of the American Mission would only he that of providing assistance which they could make available more easily than the British. jj  It was agreed that in order to avoid line-crossing  a all dealings with the Poles and Czechs in regard to S.O.E. activities would be carried out by the American Mission in London and not by Washington direct and  b whether as a result of an approach by the Poles or Czechs or on their own initiative the American S.O. Mission in London would not make any arrangements for the giving of assistance to these Allies without first consulting the British S.O.E. and concerting the measures proposed with them.  Germany and Italy  It was agreed that at any rate at the present stage there was no need to insist upon a single S..O.E. field force in t lose two countries and that there would probably be room for a long time to come for separate British and American organisations working in these areas. At the same time it was recognised as obviously essential if line-crossing wore to be avoided that there must be some clearing house' for the operations of the two organisations. It was agreed  a as far as American S.O. was concerned Germany and Italy would be operated by the S.O.E. Mission in London and not by Washington direct.  b that the American S..0. Mission and the British S.O.E. Headquarters should work in the strictest collaboration in regard to these two countries keeping each other fully advised ns to progress and policy and that they should endeavour as far as possible to allocate exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channels available. M  Sweden and Switzerland  Special problems arise in connection with these two countrios since they represent bases from which work can be carried on into several areas .  a Sweden  It was rc&ogniscd that the American S..0. would wish to establish representation in Stockholm.. It was pointed out by the British representatives that their present  Mission in Stockholm was engaged on four separate functions namely work into Norway work into Denmark whore wo work for S.I.S. as well as for ourselves and preparations for post-occupational work in Sweden itself and work into Germany. It was pointed out that whilst with work into  Germany tho general principle laid down in paragraph b above could have been easily applied and would have involved no very close connection between the American S..0. represent ative in Stockholm and tho British S O.E. Mission there work into Norway Denmark and Sweden itself was a much more delicate business. As regards Norway it was clear that activities in this country must be governed by the arrangements  t .U', 11  for Invasion Countries set out rfbovo in Section A nncl thnt it \7oulci be irapossilile for the Aracricr'.n S.O. represontotivo in Stockholm to opurntc nny field force in Norv/ny.  As records the other three countries it wos ngreed thnt he should v/ork in the closest possible collnhorntion nnd in nccerdnncc with the generr.l direction of the herd of the British S.O.E. Mission in Stockholm   k Switzorlond  Switzerlnnd is n hose for work into Germnny Itnly nnd France. It was felt however that unlike Stockholm it would probably be sufficient if it were agreed thnt nny American  S.O. representative in Switzerland should be operated by the American S.O. Mission in London and not by Washington direct and that the American S.O. Mission in London should in this connection work in the strictest collaboration with the British S.O.E. Headquarters each keeping the other fully advised with regard to progress and policy and that they should endeavour to allocate as far as possible exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channels available. With London thus being used as a clearing house it was felt that it would not bo ncccssrry or perhpas not even advisable for the local representatives in Switzerland to have any connection with each other.  3. FORTH AFRICA AND THE IBERIAH PENINSULAR A Forth Africa and Gibraltar  The following provisional arrangement was arrived at in regard to this aroa  i North Africa including Spanish Morocco to be regarded as predominantly an American sphere of influence.  The American S.O. to establish the Mission for North Africa the head of which would be responsible for S.O.E. activities in that area. The existing British organisation would continue and its personnel would remain administratively and operationally responsible to a British head but the latter would  operate under the general direction and control of the American head of the Mission machinery will bo set up to this end.  iii General policy would be agreed between Washington and London and instructions would be issued by Washington to the American Head of the Mission a copy of any such agreed instructions would be sent from London to the head of the British organisation.  iv Gibraltar as an S.O.E base from which supplies of arms and equipment transport facilities and W/T facilities are made available would remain outside the area of the North African Mission and under the control of the head of the British S.O.E. organisation.  v In order to ensure the closest co-operation and liaison between the Mission and the local British civil and military authorities machinery will be sot up which will enable the Governor and G-in-0 Gibraltar and the Britifh, 12  Consul-Gonerol Tnngicr to exercise the necessnry supervision and eo-ordinetion  B SPAIN nNE PORTUGAL  In view of the fnct that 8.0.3. activities in Portugal  other than the use of Lisbon as n base for the creation of M lines of communication into Franco have been practically reduced to nothing by the decision of the British Ambassador and the Foreign Office and of the fnct that British activities in Spain are to all intents and purposes directed and controlled by the British Naval Attache in Madrid it was agreed that there was no need to come to a detailed agreement regarding collaboration between the British and American S.O.G.s in this territory in the course of the present discussions. Such collaboration as was possible could bo worked out in due course on the spot between the present American S.O. re presentative at Lisbon and Madrid -or by his successor if he were removed -and the local British representatives.  It was indicated by the S.O.E. representatives that it might bo very convenient to have the American S.O. handle the few W/T contacts loft to the British S.O.E. in Portugal.  It was made clear that the section operating in Lisbon on lines of communication into Franco would not bo included in any arrangements for collaboration in the Iberian Peninsula proper., , ARCHIVES FILE NUMBER SUBJECT .

DR-M-   TP COPIED AT 1240. 9.6.42., ADZ/US/973  TO A.D. Copy to AD/U  AGENDA FOR 0 50000 s VISIT.  Reference your memorandum AD/XX/2152 of 5.6.42. the following are points arising out of W/T and Devices Sections which should be taken up with 0.50000 during his forthcoming visit  1. RESEARCH AKD DEVELOPMENT.  a w/T. I should like to know what are G.50000 s intentions as regards research and development on W/T apparatus suitable for work under his charter. We feel there is a definite need for close liaison in respect to this and that the Americans should be allotted a specific task and we should have the benefit of their research and they the benefit of ours. What we are afraid of is that both will conduct research on the same subject and there will be the usual duplication.  b Devices. So far as we know G.50000 has no Devices Research institute and the Devices he has so far produced are Chinese copies of our own. Again we do not wish to have duplication in respect of research. 2. PRODUCTION. W/T and Devices. Our proposal here is whole-hearted co-operation with the Americans and in fact we propose that there should be a frank interchange of stock and production figures so that the proper balance can be kept on both sides -both qualitatively as well as quantitatively.  3. LIAISON. We would suggest that two Liaison Officers should /be, -2   be appointed -one on W/T and one on Devices who  should pay periodic visits to the U.S.A. to discuss both research and production matters I think it better for the liaison to be carried from this  country to America rather than the other way round. It would not of course exclude their sending people over here but regular liaison should be from east to west rather than from west to east a, MZ/2X/812. 6 6 42.  To M From MX  Conference with G and Gr 50 000.  As far as tlie Czechs and Poles are concerned there is the general question of American approaches to Czech and Polish officials on the subject of their secret organisations and if it were possible the desirability of laying down some hard and fast rule by which there was no question of the Americans and our selves competing for Czech and Polish favours.  The other main outstanding question is the Polish efforts in South America. This is a subject of which no one here has or can have any first hand knowledge and I suggest that the only solution is to place Gr or G.50 000 in direct contact with Librach.  As far as the periodical surveys which Cs staff undertake on Slav opinion in the U.S.A are concerned these are of definite value to this section and should if possible be continued.  I myself would very much like to meet G while he is over here if that could be arranged in order to find out from him what his idee.s are concerning the use that might be made of Czech and Polish nationals.  The German Section would like to know what has happened to G.415. This man was over here for some time. He went through a complete course of training including parachute jumping and made an extremely good impression on everyone. He went through the course with a first class party of Frenchmen who are going out into the field. He therefore has a very good idea of our system of training and of the type of recruit who is willing to undertake really dangerous work for patriotic reasons. As he was formerly an agent of ours recruited by us we are  /naturally, naturally most anxious that his services should he used to the full in the States. 1/i/hat are his present activities I, Addendum to the Agenda for discussion with G and G50.000  Count CZERNIN has a project for dropping certain members of the Austria Action back into Austria and among other things has volunteered to go himself. There are obvious political objections to him personally going back but if we could select some of his henchmen who would not offend other political susceptibilities it might be a good egg and make a little competition which is desirable in my view.  The difficulty is that the Austria Action is under the aegis of G.50.000. IS.6., t - 2A I 0 O 4 2  ADZ/TTS/974  TO. Sit FRO .

Liaison with t0 in South America. See memo ADU/AHS/29 ched and draft cable submitted by  S.O. in Paraguay. At the present time we have no representa tive in Paraguay It isvun important country but is strategically placed alongside the German colonies in South Brasili It will be difficult to find a local Englishman to act though the Bank of London has a branch in Paraguay. It is open to discussion whether we should not at any rate have an observer agent1' there. See Lingeman s cable No.04505 2nd attached. s manufacture of pistols for dropping oyer occupied terrl This matter has been handled by M and will resumably be taken up with 'G' by him.  The points'at issue are clearly set out in cables 83819 from New York and 2021 to New York 94628 from New York and 2079 to New York. Cooperation with M.o.I. in Latin America. This has been agreed in principle End the tf.o.i have sent us some general suggestions as to how we can assist them. See attached report of interview ADUl/AMS/90 between AD/U.l U.l and Bonham Garter of M.o.I. The latter is getting out detailed suggestions for us.  We should discuss with G the practical methods of carrying into effect any suggestions M.o.l. make. Presum ably under existing conditions we shall have to get F.O. approval of anything we wish to do and cue man will have to keep his YP informed. I have told Bonham Carter that on general principles I consider it most unwise that our man should be in touch directly with the M.o.I. local representa tive. Any specific operations that they wish to have carried out should be passed to us here and by us to New York There may be occasions when cooperation between the two men on the spot is necessary but these should be restricted as  ch as possible and coordination leit to the local YP.  Future of 8.T.8.103. This has bedn the subject of cables and will no doubt be raised by MU A memorandum on the subject by G.T.l. is attached GTl/02 /l840 .  THIS IS A COPY ORIGINAL DOCUMENT RETAINED IN DEPARTMENT UNDER SECTION 3 4 OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT 1958, AD/XX/2250 13th June 1942  TO C.D. PROM A.D.  AGSKDA FOR G.50 OOP.  1 set out hereunder the subjects which as a result of the replies to the circular sent out to Directors appear to require discussion with 0.50 000. I am adding my comments as to how I would suggest they should be discussed attaching relevant papers.  1. WORLD-WIDE AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN BRITISH AND AMERICAN S.O.E. IN VARIOUS FIELDS. Discussion on this problem will of course be handled by you personally. You have already received a paper summaris ing the conclusions reached at our meeting yesterday afternoon.  2 RELATIONS OF G.50 000 WITH ALLIED GOVERNMENTS. This also should be handled by you at any rate initially though detailed discussion of the situation in relation to particular governments could then be handed over to the Directors concerned. There is no paper to attach on this subject since the principle to which you want to get G.50 000 to agree Is al ready quite clear and has now been stated by you already this morning.  3. METHODS OF OBTAINING SPECIAL SUPPLIES OF EQUIPMENT OR MATERIAL FROM G.50 000 FOR BRITISrl S.O.E. ORGANISATIONS OR AMERICAN ORGANISATIONS IN BRITISH FIELDS OF INFLUENCE. Beyond broaching with G.50 000 the broad principle  if you agree with it that we ought not to go behind the local Cs.4n-C in the field or the munitions board at head quarters as this cannot in the long run be in the best interest of the war effort I think you should leave the discussion of this problem to the Directors concerned -which in practice will amount to leaving it to A/D.3 since Cairo is the area in which this problem is actual. I attach hereto at 3. for your information a paper prepared by A/D.3 which covers this subject together with a telegram from Cairo 1934 at 3a. which states their view with which we do not altogether agree.  4. SUPPLY OF GOLD FROM AMERICAN SOURCES TO THE MINISTER OF STATE CAIRO THROUGH THE GOOD OFFICES OF G.50 000. I suggest that you could leave discussion on this specific point to A/D.3. I attach hereto at 4. a copy of the Minister of State's telegram to G.50 000 on this subject which is selfexplanatory., 2  5. LIAISON WITH TIS AMBRICAHS KEGARDIHG RESEARCH DElilflEliSMT MD PRODUCTION WORK. I suggest that this can be left for discussion with A/DZ but I attach here at 5. a paper from him whifih explains what is in his mind.  6. RELATIONS OF G.50 000 'WITH POLISH ORGANISATIONS. This is connected with the subject of paragraph 2. above but I strongly recommend that MX should meet G.50 000 and put his points himself. It attach at 6. a short paper from MX which indicates what he wants to talk about.  7. AUSTRIA ACTION. MX also wishes to discuss a project with G.50 000 which involves the use of Austria Action which is now under his aegis I attach at 7. MX's paper on this subject.,  1 a in any case is much wider than our own.   2 ..   3  4 Some Comments on the forthcoming Talks about Go-operation between British and American S.O E  It seems desirable that the terms of reference of the  new amalgamated bodies should be defined. Colonel Donovan's  sphere of activity does not seem to have yet been exactly  decided/ In view however of our painful experiences with   G and the M. of I. the limitation of the combined S.O.E.  activities in relation to these departments should be agreed.  Colonel D. seems to have strong leanings towards 'G and  Propaganda activities and a renewal of disputes seems very  likely unless some agreement is reached.  It might also be desirable to indicate the lines on which the combined S.O.E. should co-operate with Combined Operations.  It requires no prophet to foresee almost as many diffi culties with the State Department as S.O.E. has had with the  P.0. Some plans for a joint front towards these all-powerful Departments should be discussed. It will probably be necessary to treat different countries in different ways. For example the British S.O.E. might wish to conduct certain activities in .Occupied Prance. The State Department very jealous of its influence might object. Should the discussion be carried on with the State Department through British S.O.E. via the P.0 or through the S.O.E. liaison direct with Washington A similar state of affairs might occur in Turkey should the American S.O.E. wish to become active in 'Turkey against the wishes of our P.0. and the best method of procedure might be either the same or the reverse. Russia Perhaps a great opportunity is given at last to start real co-operation. The possibilities of communism in subversive warfare are obvious. It might appear that the British would find it less difficult to make use of them than the Americans. On the other hand something really might be accomplished by the direct approach between the President and Stalin. A comprehensive and general cnarter shovild be prepared and the President might be persuaded to put it across to Stalin and get it agreed.  Security This cannot be stressed too much in our con versations. If we are going to let Americans into our organisation everywhere we are running a very grave danger. No American is really security minded. We should be between the devil and the deep sea. Either they will have to be told all -which seems inevitable -in which case we run great risks of the business being blown or they will have to be only partly informed in which case sooner or later they will evolve grievances. This aspect should be thoroughly ventilated with G.50 000., ii Notes on Collaboration between British and United States S.O.E.  OBJECT  1. The object of these notes is to lay down the principles on which such collaboration must be based the reasons behind these principles and the machinery by which they might be effected. PRINCIPLES  2. COOPERATION AT H.Q. LONDON/WASHINGTON. This is dependent on close liaison resulting in a common policy and is essential if we are to avoid crossing lines either in policy or In the supply of materials.  This liaison could be effected by a British liaison section working alongside Colonel Donovan s headquarters in Washington and a similar American liaison section working along side S.O.E. headquarters London. The duties of this liaison section would be   a To represent the views of their respective headquarters on all policy matters so that a common policy for every theatre can be decided on.  b To discuss with the H.Q. to which they have been accredited cases of dispute in the field which have been referred to that H.Q.  c To exchange Information and to keep their head quarters fully Informed of matters of interest.  d To coordinate the production demand and supply of equipment from British and U.S. sources.  e To exchange both operational and technical intelli gence and information on methods of training. Such a liaison section might consist of one head liaison officer who would be a high level representative charged with executive functions supported by requisit staff.  3. COOPERATION IN THE FIELD. It is essential to avoid the situation where there will be two completely independent organisations working in the field with all the consequent dangers of crossing of lines competition for agents and material etc. and inviting attempts by foreign governments or groups with whom both organisations would be dealing to play one off against the other.  In some cases the problem could be dealt with by assigning the given region exclusively either to the American or British organisation the organisation which agrees to stay out being represented at the most only by a liaison officer., 2  There will however he very few of these simple cases and in most areas the position will be that whilst an area is predominantly a British or American sphere of influence both countries will have some interests inside it and will need to establish some sort of representation and possibly a system of agents.  It is suggested that the general principles to be adopted in such cases should be   a Each area should be defined as being either a British or American area.  b Inside a British area it will be agreed that the control and direction should be British and that the policy should be laid down and all instructions to the Mission or Missions in that area should be issued from London. In an American area the same procedure would apply as regards Washington.  c In the field in a British area there would be a British Mission the head of which would be controller for the whole area and who would look for his direction and instructions to London. There could if the Americans so wished in the same territory be an American Mission which would have its own head quarters its own stations and its own agents butthe American Mission and its head at those headquarters would work under the direction and control of the British controller. The head of the American Mission could report direct to Washington on any matter he wished with a copy to the American liaison mission in London but he would receive his instructions from London and through the British controller and would only act on communications received direct from Washington with the agreement and consent of the British controller. In an American territory the same princi ple would apply with the roles reversed.  d In the event of a difference of opinion arising between the British or American controller and the head of the British or American Mission inside his territory which could not be settled locally the issue would be re ferred to London or Washington respectively and it v ould be the resporblbility of the headquarters in  question to settle it with the liaison mission attached to it. Even these rather general principles may not be able to be applied strictly in all cases and it may be necessary to make exceptions in certain countries to meet special requirements.     DETAILED REGOMMENDaTIOlMS.  4. IvIeddie east including the Balkans. It is recommended that this should be declared a British sphere of influence and that the principles outlined in para graph 3. above should be applied.  Thus it would be in order for the American S.O.E. to set up a mission in Cairo which in turn might have its own rep resentation and its own agents in the field in other stations such as Istanbul Tehran Baghdad etc. but this American, 3  machine would only be operated under the direction and control of the British controller. In effect the position would be that the British controller would have under him two organisat ions one British in its personnel the other American. He would exercise control in accordance with the present arrange ments namely he would himself look for direction to London  to the Minister of State for policy in those countries included in the latter's charter and to the C.-in-C in military matters. He would represent both units of his organisation on the S.O.E.  Committee.  5. INDIA. It is recommended that this should be declared exclusively a British sphere of influence and that all S.O.E. work would be carried out by the British S.O.E. without any American S.O.E. being established. If thought necessary however by G.50 000 an American liaison officer could be attached to the British organisation in order to facilitate transit of American personnel and material through India for China.  6. EAST AFRICA & MADAGASCAR It is recommended that this should be declared a British sphere of influence. G.50 000 may not wish to estatUsh more than a liaison mission in this area but should he wish to set up an American organisation this should be done in accordance with the principles outlined in paragraph 3. above and illustrated in the case of the Middle East.  7. 1EST AFRICA. Frawest. It Is recommended that this should be declared a British sphere of influence and that if an American mission is set up it should work in accordancd with the principles outlined in paragraph 3. x  The appointment of a Minister Resident for West Africa renders the position there almost entirely analogous to that in the Middle East and the same procedure should therefore be adopted as in the case of Cairo the head of the S.O.E. organi sation representing both the organisations under his control on the Minister's War Council.  I  WEST AFRICA. Neucols.  It is recommended that the same procedure should be adopted as in regard to West Africa Frawest.  S. ATLANTIC ISLANDS. It is recommended that these should be an American sphere of influence. It Is probable that the British S.O.E. would not wish to establish more than a liaison officer in any of the islands but if they wished to establish a mission it must work according to the principles laid down in paragraph 3.  9. CHINA. It is recommended that this should be declared an Americansphere of influence andthatassoonastheAmericanS.O.E. has the necessary personnel installed at Chungking and particu larly a head of Mission of the necessary standing the principles outlined in paragraph 3. should be applied. This would involve, 4  a reduction of the present staff of the British S.O.E. in China and the British organisation would thenceforth work under the direction and control of the head of the American Mission.  10. AUSTRALIA. No S.O.E. mission exists in Australia hut certain  S.O.E. representatives have been loaned to set up an independent Australian organisation with the title of I.S.D. At present this mission corresponds direct with S.O.E.London on technical and other matters but it is controlled by the supreme C.-in-C. South-West Pacific. Since this theatre has an American C.-in-C. it is recommened that it should be considered as a U.S. sphere of influence and that Colonel Donovan should make his own arrangements for cooperation direct with I.S.D. and the supreme C.-in-C.  It is essential however that there should be the closest cooperation between the Australian organisation aid the S.O.E. mission in India. ' 'his is especially necessary as regards operations into the Dutch East Indies.  Such cooperation between the two missions might be effected by the provision of an American or Australian liaison officer In India and a British liaison officer in Australia or through Dutch channels.  11. SOUTH AMERICA. As far as we can learn it is unlikely that G.50 000 s charter will be extended to cover South America. If this is confirmed by G.50 000 himself there will be no point in dis cussing with him the arrangements under which the British S.O.E. should work in this area.  If any American agency is appointed to deal with S.O.E. work in B0uth America we would be prepared to have this area declared an American sphere of influence and to collaborate with the American organisation in accordance with the principles laid down in paragraph 3.  If no American organisation is appointed to carry on  S.O.E. work in South America then we shall persist in our endeavours to have the British S.O.E. organisation working independently. 12 IBERIA AND NORTH AFRICA.  The British S.O.E. have an organisation covering North Africa based on Gibraltar. They have also got representation In Lisbon and Madrid but now carry out very few activities in Spain and Portugal. Moreover as far as Spain is concerned control of S.O.E. activity Is to all Intents and purposes in the hands of YN and the latter has not only a direct interest in Spanish Morocco including Tangier but has also an indiect Interest in the North African area generally. G.50 000 has a representative in Tangier with a small American staff with a high degree of mobility and fairly good contacts and a representa tive in Lisbon G.50 200 who is in charge of G.50 000's interests in Spain and Portugal is senior to and has authority over G.50 000's representative in Tangier and finally is, himself something of an expert on North Africa.  In view of the North African directive which has been received from the Chiefs of Staff it is of the utmost importance that there should be a single and tightly organised S.O.E. machine operating in North Africa receiving its direction and instructions from one headquarters only. There Is no absolute logical necessity for the Inclusion of the Iberian peninsula with North Africa in the same area but such an inclusion is for practical purposes rendered necessary as a result of the personal position of YN and G.50 200.  If Spain is handled separately from North Africa the man in charge of the North African Mission will sooner or later get at cross purposes with YN. Similarly G.50 200 is stationed as Assistant Military Attache at Lisbon but it would be ex tremely difficult to insist that he should have nothing to do with North African affairs.  here is one person under whom it should be possible to operate a single mission covering the Iberian peninsula and North Africa and that is A/DW. fie maintains the best possible relations with YN and both G.50 200 and G.B.6000 would probably be ready to serve under him.  It is therefore recommended that the area covered by the Iberian peninsula and North Africa should be constituted as a single mission that is should at any rate for the present be regarded as a British sphere of Interest that it should be operated from London as headquarters and that A/DW should be placed in charge.  Every effort should be made to get G.50 000 to agree that the mission so constituted should work strictly in accordance with the principles elaborated in paragraph 3.  It must always be borne in Blind that should American operations In North Africa be projected the control could be transferred to Washington.  13. ENEMY AND ENEMY OCCUPIED TERRITORIES IN WEST AND CENTRAL EUROPE. It is recommended that we should endeavour to get G.50 000 to agree that this area should be regarded at any rate for the present as a British sphere of influence.  The application of the principles laid down In paragraph  3. would then imply that G.50 000 would come and set up a mission in London which would work in the area in question under the control and direction of the head of the British organisation dealing with these territories -namely M. In actual fact it is probable that the Americans will not want to set up an organisation of this kind as they will recognise that with some small exceptions it would be impossible for them to work into Western and Central Europe for many months to come.  We should therefore try and get them to agree that they should concentrate on the training of agents and making all other necessary preparations to provide adequate American personnel to accompany the American portion of the expeditionary force to France. Such agents would be recruited and partially, %  -6   trained in U.S.A. and then s ent to England for their training to be completed and for attachment to the appropriate American units. At the same time it is recognised that G.50 000 is virtually certain to insist upon sending representatives to Stockholm Vichy and Serne and these representatives are certain to get in touch in turn with local elements.  As regards Stockholm the ideal arrangement would be that the American representative shouh work under the general direction and control of our chief representative there. It is unlikely however that 0.50 000 could be got to agree to this. We should insist however at least on an arrangement by which 0.50 000 s representative should be handled exclusively by G.50 000's liaison mission in London i.e. he should communi cate only with them and should receive his instructions only from them and not direct from Washington. Moreover it should be agreed that the liaison mission in London should keep the British S.O.E. fully informed of all such reports and should agree instructions with them before they are despatched. It should moreover be agreed that 0.50 000 s representative should not work independently with resistance groups in Norway or Denmark.  As regards Vichy and Berne it is recommended that tie American representatives should not have any contacts with the British S.O.E. field forces in these areas but that they should be handled by the American liaison mission in London who would keep the British S.O.E. fully informed of their activities and agree policy instructions with them., Refi CD/2522  19.6.42.

Again thanking you for your help and wishing you fca . best of luck.  lours very sincerely, Notes on Collaboration between British  and United States S.O.E.  \  OBJECT  1. The object of these notes is to lay down on which such collaboration must be based the reasons behind these principles and the machinery by which they might be effected. PRINCIPLES  2. COOPERATION AT E.Q. LONDON/WASHINGTON This is dependent on close liaison resulting in a common policy and is essential If we are to avoid crossing lines either in policy or in the supply of materials.  This liaison could be effected by a British liaison section working alongside Colonel Donovan's headquarters in Washington and a similar American liaison section working along side S.O.E. headquarters London. The duties of this liaison section would bes    a To represent the views of their respective headquarters on all policy matters so that a common policy for every theatre can be decided on.   b To discuss with the headquarters to which they have been accredited cases of dispute in the field which have been referred to that headquarters.  c To exchange information and to keep their head quarters fully informed of matters of interest.  d To coordinate the production demand and supply of equipment from British and U.S. sources.  e To exchange both operational and technical intelli gence and Information on methods of training. Such a liaison section might consist of one head liaison officer who would be a high level representative charged with executive functions supported by requisite staff.  3. COOPERATION IN THE FIELD. It Is essential to avoid the situation where there will be two completely independent organisations working in the field with all the consequent dangers of crossing of lines competition for agents and material etc. and inviting attempts by foreign governments or groups with whom both organisations would be dealing to play one off against the other.  In some cases the problem could be dealt with by assigning the given region exclusively either to the American or British organisation the organisation which agrees to stay out being represented at the most only by a liaison officer and a small staff., -2-   There will however be very few of these simple cases md in most areas the position will be that whilst an area is predominantly a British or American sphere of influence both countries will have some interests inside it and v/ill need to establish some sort of representation and possibly a system of agents.  It is suggested that the general principles to be adopted in such cases should be   a Each area should be defined as being either a British or American area.  b Inside a British area it will be agreed that the control and direction should be British and that ' the policy should be laid down and all instructions to the Mission or Missions in that area should be issued from London. In an American area the same procedure would apply as regards Washington.  c In the field in a British area there would be a British Mission the head of which would be controller for the whole area and who would look for his direction and instructions to London. There could if the Americans so v/ished in the same territory be an American Mission which would have its own head quarters its own stations and its own agents but the American Mission and its head at those headquarters would work under the' direction and control of the British controller. The head of the American Mission could report direct to Washington on any matter he wished with a copy to the American liaison mission in London but he would receive his instructions from London and through the British controller aid would only act on communications received direct from Washington with the agreement and consent of the British controller. In an American territory the same princi ple would apply with the roles reversed.  d In the event of a difference of opinion arising between the British or American controller and the head of the British or American Mission inside his territory which could' ridt bo settled locally the issue would be re ferred to London or Washington respective and it would be the responsibility of the he-adquarters in question to settle it with the liaison mission attached to it. Even these rather general principles may not be able to be applied strictly in all c&seS 'and it may be necessary to make exceptions in certain countries to meet specI'al'-.requirements ., NO. 1. 17th June. 1942.  Record of Discussion regarding collaboration  between British and -American S.O.B.  We set out hereunder a draft record of conversations on the above subject which took place on Tuesday norning 16th June 1942 between Colonel Goodfellow Colonel Garland Williams and Colonel Taylor and hr. Keswick and further conversations which took place in the evening of the 16th June between Colonel Goodfellow Colonel Taylor and Hr. Keswick.  The object of these discussions was to review the position in all areas throughout the world where collaboration between the British and American S.O.Es was possible with a view to determining how the principles set out in the paper headed Notes on collaboration between British and United States S.O.E . handed by Sir Charles Karnbro to Colonel Donovan   Copy attached hereto should be applied to each area.  It .was understood that the conversations were purely exploratory in character and that any agreement of views reached between the parties would in no way bind their principals without specific confirmation. It was further agreed that the procedure should be that a record would be made'of the discussions and agreed between the parties and that subject to confirmation by principals further discussionswould then be held covering each area in detail at which the appropriate Directors of the British .S.O.E. would attend with a view to working out agreements for each area in the most exact terms possible.  The various areas were reviewed in the following order and the following conclusions were arrived at  1. INDIA It was agreed that India -should be regarded as a British area where all operations would be carried out by the British mission with control being exercised from London. The American  C.O. would have the right to send out a liaison mission to be attached to the British mission for liaison purposes but not for operational purposes. 2. CHINA It was agreed that this area of which the headquarters. would bo at Chungking and which cover the whole of China including Japanese occupied China Manchuria and Korea should be regarded as an American sphere of influence. The American Mission would be established at Chungking and would direct all  S.O. activities in this area. It would be controlled from Washington. The existing British Mission at Chungking would he reduced and would be turned into a liaison mission attached to the American Mission. Tho British liaison mission in, 2  addition to its liaison duties would render any assistance which it could to the American mission but only at tho latter's request and under the latter's control  3. 'AUSTRALIA It was agreed that British S.O.L would have no responsibility for and would take no action in the area covered by General MacArthur's Command and that of the American Naval Command in the South Western Pacific This area would be considered as covering New Guinea and the Islands of the East Indian archipelago up to and inoluding Java and Borneo. It would be for the American S.O. to make its' own arrangements with the I.3.D. which already exists in Australia under General MacArthur s control. British S.O.E. would continue to give any assistance asked for to this.Mission.  4. It was 'agreed that Burma Siam Indo-China Malaya and Sumatra should be regarded as a no-man's land which could be worked into as convenient by the British S.O.E. Mission in India the American S.O. Mission in China and I.S.D in Australia. Line crossing inside this area would have to be avoided by close liaison between these three missions.  5. EAST AFRICA It was agreed that the area covered by the British S.O.E. Mission which already exists with Its headquarters at Durban charged with working Into Madagascar and Portuguese East Africa should be regarded as a British area American 0. would have the right to have a liaison mission attached to the British Mission at Durban.  6. WEST AFRICA -Frawest L Neucols Whilst it was agreed that the area covered b -these two existing British S.O.E. missions -namely the West African colonies from the southern boundary of Morocco to the boundary of South West Africa with Portuguese West Africa should be for the time being regarded as predominantly a Britishsphere it was recognised that tho American S.O. had a very definite interest in this area since if any military action on a large scale were to be undertaken by the United Nations in West Africa such action would predominantly be the responsibility of the American Military Authorities The American S.O. therefore consider that they must place themselves in a position to be able to carry out S.O.E. services for the American Command if such a situation should arise. The following procedure was accordingly agreed upon -   American S.O. would establish Missions corresponding to our Prawest and Neucols Missions. The programme of these American Missions would be worked out in as much detail as possible between Washington and London. Copies of this agreed programme would then be sent to the Heads-of the American Missions and the Hoads of the British Missions with clear instructions in both cases that the execution of this programme by the American Missions would be discussed step by step with the Heads of tho British Missions and no action taken until agreement had been, -3   reached with them. If such agreement could not be arrived a t the point at issue would be referred to headquarters to be settled between London and Washington and until decision was given no action would be taken by the American 1'Iissions. It was contemplated that the programme which would be worked out between London and Washington for these American Missions would be essentially preparatory in character consisting of the placing of American representatives at appropriate points v tho establishment of dumps of materials collection of information and operational intelligence and the working out of plans against  appropriate targets.  7. ATLLiTTIC ISLAUDS It was agreed that these Islands comprising the Azores Madeira the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands should bo regarded as an American sphere and operated by an American Mission controlled from Washington The British S.G.E. would have the right to attach liaison officers to the American organisation.  8. BALKAN AMD THE MIDDLE EAST It was agreed that In view of the fact that all Military Commands iti this area were British Commands that the principal political authority was the British Minister of State at Cairo and that the whole of the territory other than Turkey within which and from which operations could take place or be based was wholly or partially under British Military occupation the areaat.present covered by the British S.O.E. with its head quarters at Cairo should be regarded as predominantly a British area. At the sa me time it was appreciated that there were many ways in which the American S.O. could be of groat assistance in this area. It could call upon-resourcos in regard to equip ment materials and possibly personnel which were not available to the British S.O.E. and in certain areas for example Turkey and Irafi American personnel could in somo respects operate more easily than British personnel.  The British representatives stressed the extreme com plexity of the situation with partia-ular regard to the fact that S.O.E. have to work in this area with a number of Allied Governments and foreign freedom movements or resistance groups and emphasised the delicacy of the political situation in various occupied or semi-occupied countries and the necessity of any  S.O.E. organisation conforming to tho policy of the local authorities such as the Minister of State tho local Military Commanders & the local Diplomatic representatives. They were accordingly of tho opinion that if line crossing confusion and friction with local authorities was to be avoided it was especially essential in this area that there should be unity of control in the field and unity of direction from a single headquarters. They accordingly suggested that the set-up should be as follows - The controller of the existing British S.O.E. Mission would be regarded as being in charge of all S.O.E. operations in that area and would be responsible for all S.O.E. activity to the local authorities particularly the S.O.E. Sub-Committee of the Minister of State's War Council and to headquarters in London An American S.O. Mission should be set up in Cairo with the object of providing such assistance as it could to the British  S.O.E. and of contributing to the British S.O.E . services which would only be available from tho American side. The form and extent of tho organisation of the American Mission and also tho, scope and character of its activities would bo discussed and settled by the Head of the American Mission with the British Controller under whom he would be working. In the event of failure to reach agreement the issue would be referred to Headquarters to bo settled between London and V/ashington and in the meantime the .views of the Controller would prevail. The Hoad of the American Mission would communicate direct with Washington on any matter ho pleased but it would be clearly laid down that as regards any action the American Mission would look to the Controller for direction and instructions .and would take no action except with his approval.  The substantial effect of this arrangement would be that there would bo a single S.O.E. machine in the area at the head of which would be the present Controller but that under him there would be two organisations namely the existing British Â§.0.E. organisation covering the whole area of the Mission and a small American organisation which would be fitted by the Controller into the general programme wherever it could help.  9 WESTSR1I EUROPE  % It was agreed that collaboration between the British and American S.O.Es in the V/cstern European area which should be understood as covering Scandinavia and the Baltic area the Low Countries Franee Switzerland Germany Italy Poland and Czechoslovakia would have to be arranged in two stages.  On the British side it was appreciated that as there will a t some future date' be a very large American force based on Great Britain with the task of carrying on military operations in Eastern Europe there must eventually be a complete American S.O attached to this American Command to carry out S.0 E scr.vices for it in those areas in Western Europe which have been allocated to American forces. Once those areas were known it would bo easy to apply the principle that all 5 0.E. activities vii thin the area allocated to the American Command would be carried on by the American S.O. the latter taking over from B ritish 3.O.E. any field organisation whi ch the British S.O.E. might in the meantime have established in territories eventually placed under American Command.  It was recognised firstly that this division of military force was still some way off secondly that it would be some months before the American S.O. would be in a position to operate a s an independent organisation attached to the American Command and thirdly that not only would some interim arrangement have to be come to regarding activities by the American S.O. in Western Europe pending the drawing of the lines of demarcation but oven when the areas of the British and American Commands had been determined there would remain countries unaffected by. those invasion plans in which both the British and the American S.O.Es might wish to operate. To cover the interim period referred to above before any area could bo allocated to the American S.O. as their exclusive territory it was suggested that the following procedure should be adopted An American Mission would be set up-in London with two main functions. The first'would bo the preparation of an Amo'rican  S.O. organisation for attachment to the American Military Command This would bo largely a matter between the American S.O. Mission and the American Command in Great Britain and the British S.O.S. would only bo involved to tho extent to which, it could give assistance p articularly in matters of training to its American counterpart. The second function would be the setting up of at least embryonic American field forces in the countries likely to bo effected by the re-invasion of Europe namely Norway the Low Countries and Prance. The American representatives felt that it would be impossible for' them to refrain from taking action at all in the way of infil tration or recruitment of agents until the American sphere of ' military operations was decided. At the same time they recog nised that since the British S.O.E. had organised and were operating field forces in all these areas to a very considerable extent already it would be inviting trouble for then to commence building up an independent American field force which would very likely cross lines with existing machinery. It was accordingly  agreed that during the interim period the American Mission would establish and operate agents in the field only in collabo ration and under the general direction of the British S.O.E. headquarters. Thus agents would only be infiltrated from this country with the knowledge and approval of the British S.O.E. headquarters. Agents recruited locally by an American rep resentative such as the representative at Vichy would be notified to the British headquarters and would be sent instruct ions only with their knowledge and approval. All American agents in the field in the area in question would be operated by the American S.O.E. Mission in London and not from Washington  As regards those countries which would not be effected by any division of military force between the British and American Commands e.g. Germany Switzerland Italy Poland and Czechoslovakia it is suggested by the British S.O.E that spedial regional arrangements should bo worked out in each case providing either for the exclusive allocation of areas to one or the other organisation or for the exact machinery of collaboration required to ensure that the two organisations did not cross lines. It is for instance obvious that the Poles and the Czechs should not be encouraged to play the British and American S.O.E off against each other.  1Â°. NORTH AFRICA L THE IBEBINA PENINSULA  As the ideas put forward by tho British and American representatives regarding collaboration in these areas were completely at variance and it was consequently felt that they should refer tho proposals to their principals the discussions on this subject are dealt with in a separate paper attached hereto as Appendix 1, APPENDIX 1.  North Africa c.nd Iberian Peninsula.  The British 5.O.E. representatives suggested that North Africa should bo regarded at least for the present as a territory which should be operated from London and they out lined an arrangement by which a combined British-American organisation would be operated under a British S.O.E. officer with headquarters at Gibraltar. The factors which the British  S.O.E. had principally in mind in making this suggestion were that  a Gibraltar is the natural base for S.O.E. operations in North Africa It would bo the point at which all stores would have to be assembled for distribution in North Africa.and It is the site of the S.O.E. W/T Station which would eventually operate all agents W/Ts In North Africa and would provide the main line channel to London in the event of other lines failing. As an S.O.E. headquarters at Gibraltar would be dealing with British authorities in that fortress such dealings would bo facilitated if a British S.O.E. officer wera in charge.  b At the present stage London is pferhaps a better operational headquarters for dealing m th North Africa than Washington from the point of view of distanco and facilitios for tho consultation of interested pa rties.  c It is desirable that Madrid which has a direct interest In the North African picture through Spanish Morocco and an indirect interest in the French North African situation should be kept in step. As the dominating factor in Madrid as regards S.O.E. work is the British Naval Attache there 'would be certain advantages in having a man in charge at Gibraltar who had close relations with him.  d British S.O.E. wore prepared to supply their best available man in the person of Colonel Clarke who had boon dealing with this area for a long time who would be persona grata at Gibraltar Tangier and Madrid and who enjoys special relations with the British Naval Attache in Madrid and with the American S.O. sta ff In Lisbon and North Africa. British S.O.E. suggested that if their ideas were accept able to their American colleagues they would propose that the whole area of the Iberian Pcninsulp and North Africa should be grouped together as a single mission to be operated under the control of London. The exact relationship of American to British personnel at Lisbon Gibraltar and Tangier would have to be worked out in the course of further discussion the guiding principle being the necessity for a certain minimum degree of unity of control in tho field and direction from a single headquarters.  The American representatives expressed the view that the North African area should be. regarded as a predominantly American sphere in which a combined American and British organisation would operate under the control of Washington. The main factors, which they had in mind in making this proposal were that  1  a Any approaches to French authoritios in North Africa would almost certainly have to bo mado through American channels.  b Any military operations which it might bo decided to carry out in North Africa would almost certainly bo the responsibility of the United States authorities and the command would be American.  c All discusssions with French authorities in North Africa were intimately bound up with the economic policy to be adopted towards North Africa by the United Nations. This was predominantly a matter for Washington's decision and it vms absolutely essential to co-ordinato any political-military negotiations in North Africa with the policy of the Bureau of Economic Warfare in Washington. This could obviously bo done most effectively if control ' of the S.O.E. organisation engaged in these negotiat ions was in Washington also. The American representatives therefore proposed that an Ancricari Mission should be sot up with headquarters at Gibraltar and they indicated that they would like to send a now and senior officer to bo head of this Mission. They thought that the Iberian Peninsula should bo separated from North Africa and that special arrangements should bo made for Anglo-American collaboration in that area., NO. 2. 19th June 1942.  Record of Discussion regarding collaboration betwoon British and American S.O.B.  We sot out hereunder a draft record of conversations which took place in the afternoon of Thursday June 18th 1942. There were present representing American S.O. Colonel Goodfellow and representing British S.O.E. Brigadier Gubbins Colonel Taylor Mr. Keswick and Captain Pleydell-Bouverle.  The object of the discussion was to review in more detail the position regarding collaboration between British and American S.O.Es in the Western and Central European area v/hich was covered in a general way by the discussions of the 16th June recorded in paragraph 9. of the Record of Discussions dated 17th June.  Brigadier Gubbins who had not been present at the pre vious discussions explained in more detail the activities of tho British S.O.E. in Western Europe and pointed out that some clarification and perhaps a certain modification of the conclusions reached at the previous mooting and sot down in paragraph 9. referred to above were required.  The discussion then ranged over a wide variety of problems and for gairposos of clarity it is proposed in this record to set down e summary of the conclusions reached in a more systematized way than would be possible if a merely historical record of the discussion were attempted. These conclusions in so far as they modify those reached at the previous meeting should be regarded as replacing the latter.  The division of the area in question for purposes of discussion into those countries likely to bo invaded by the Allied Forces and those not likely to be so immediately effected was again recognised as was also the fact that arrangements for collaboration covering the former territories would have to be treated in at least two phases. For purposes of con venience therefore tho summary of conclusions will follow this classification.  A. INVASION SPHERE.. This sphere covers Norway Holland Belgium and France. Arrangements for collaboration would have to go through at least two phases of which only tho first could be discussed in de tail at tho present time. This first phase would bo one in which the British S.O.E. would continue very much as it is at present working both on the development and operation of a field force of agents in each of tho countries concerned and on the building up of anS.Q.E liaison organisation for attach ment to tho appropriate Military Commands to accompany them to tho Continent whilst the American S.O. concentrated on preparatory work at the same time giving such assistance as, they could to the British S.O.h. In its task of operating the field force abroad. 'Phis phase would end as soon as tho stage was reached when the question arose of a S.O.B. liaison organisation attached to an American Command taking over the actual operation of a field force abroad.  1. FIRST PHASE.  Q- Organisation in the Field .  It was agreed that it was essential that tho field force in each of the four countries concerned should con tinue to be treated as one whole the object being to create throughout the area likely to be invaded by Allied Forces a single united nations fifth column organisation to be at tho disposal of the Allied invading force whether American or British. This would mean in practice that the American S.O. Mission in England would not with tho exception of tho case referred to at the end of this para graph put agents of their own into these countries who would function separately from tho existing field force and who would .be opera ted separately hy thorn from London. If agent personnel was available from American sources it would bo .treated .exactly-like -agent personnel available' from other sources and infiltrated by the existing head quarter organisation into the appropriate country to work as part of the one existing field force there. In effect during this first phase there would bo no change in the character or mo-thod of operation of the field force abroad tho American S.O. simply contributing such assistance as   they could in regard to personnel equipment facilities intelligence -otc . The typo of assistance particularly envisaged by the British S.O.E. representatives was passports air transport and assistance regarding dollar transactions.  The exception referred to above is tho case of American   representation at Vichy. It was -appreciated that as long as tho United States retain diplomatic relations to tho Vichy Government it was possible for the American S.0. to have an organisation based on their diplomatic mission insider Vichy Franco and in fact they havo made all arrange ments to establish such representation. It was further recognised that American S.O. representatives in Vichy would inevitably make contacts and crcato though perhaps hot on a largo scale a system of agents. It was agreed that such a field force should not as far as could -at present be seen have any direct connection with the normal S.O.E field force in Franco. At tho same-time to avoid confusion it was agreed that  i this Vichy organisation would bo operated by the American Mission in London and not by Washington direct and  ii that tho S.O. Mission in London would operate in closest collaboration and in accord with the general direction of tho British S.O.E. French Region.  b Liaison Organisation. It was agreed that the American S.O would concentrate primarily upon the recruitment and training of liaison staff which would eventually be attached to tho American Commands in order to provide for the latter S.O. services in the, areas in which they 'would ho operating. It was envisaged that the American 5.0 would recruit this personnel in the United Sates give thorn preliminary training there and then send them to England for further training. Such recruit ment and training would of course bo the responsibility of the American S.O. but the Eritish S.O.E. would place all training facilities in England at their disposal. The American S.O would of course only require to recruit liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands with qualifications for operating in those countries which would be invaded by American forces. It was considered probable that a sufficiently definite indication of those countries could be obtained at an early date. As soon as such indication had been given the British S.O.E. 'would cease to recruit and train liaison Personnel for those countries which had been allocated to American Commands.  At least a certain proportion of the American S.O. liaison personnel would have to be given as part of their1 training an intimate knowledge of the field organisation with which they would eventually have to work and this could only bo done by training them in the country sections concernod at British S.O.E. headquarters.  2. SECOiJD PHASE. This phase would commence as indicated above when not only had there been a definite allocation between British and American forces but when also the American S.O. liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands had boon more or less completely organised and the question arose as to whether they ought not to take over the opera.tion of tho field force in the areas in which they were going to function. It was agreed that it would be impossible at this stage to la y .down arrangements to cover this contingency since so much would depend upon factors which are at present unknown o.g. the actual allocation of tho Commands tho imminence of the invasion itself etc. Thus if Nofway were allocated to the United States forces it would be comparatively simple once they had reached the necessary stage of development for the American S.O. liaison organisation attached to the American Command for this area to take over tho operation of tho field force In Norway absorbing for that purpose as much as was necessary of the country section which had hitherto been running it. On the other hand it would almost certainly be impracticable to split up the control of tho field organisation in the area comprising the Low Countries and Franco since not only would tho field force in Franco form a whole which could not be divid&cfe between two separately oontnolling headquarters in London but also the activities of tho field force through out this area once the invasion had started would be of more or loss equal importance to all parts of tho Allied lino except in the areas immediately behind the actual fighting For example sabotage activities in the area of Liege or of Luxembourg or of Chalons could bo equally useful to British forces fighting in the Low Countries and North Eastern France or American forces fighting in the region of Rouen or Amiens. A good deal will obviously depend upon the form of military command eventually established and It might well be found that if the supreme command headquarters for the whole area was established in England the concentration of the whole 5.0. headquarters with that command would bo the best solution. It was accordingly, 4  agreed tliat the way in which the control of the field  force which during the first phase would be concentrated  in the British S.O.E. headquarters should be allocated  between the British and American organisations and would  have to be worked out gradually as the situation clarified -   B. NON-1iWAS10N SPHERE This sphere covers such countries as Germany Italy Switzerland Poland Czechoslovakia and Sweden. The conclusions reached regarding the nay.in which collaboration should be effected in these areas can be conveniently set out under the three following headings  Poland and Czechoslovakia.  In regard to these two -countries the secret armies andother underground resistance organisations arc operated by the Governments of the countries concerned the role of S. O.E.. whether British or American will continue to bo essentially that of providing then .with allpossible assistance. It was recog nised that the British S.O.E. have already been 'working-for a considerable time on the job of assisting Polos and Czechs and coordinating their activities with the strategic policy laid...- down by the Chiefs of Staff Committee and that at any rate for some time to come the role of the American Mission would only bo that of providing assistance which they could make available more easily that the British.  It was agreed that in order to avoid line crossing   a all dealings with the Polos and Czechs in regard to S. Q E . activities would bo carried out by the American Mission in London and not by Washington direct and  b that whether as a result of an approach by the Poles or Czechs or on their own initiative the Amoricah S 0 . Mission in London would not make any arrange ments for the giving of assistance to these Allies without first consulting the British S..O.E. and concerting the measures proposed with them. Germany and Italy.  It was a'greed that at any rate at the present stage there was no need to insist upon a single S.O.E. field force in these two countries and that there would probably bo room for a long time to come for separate British and American organisations working in these areas. At .the/.some time it was' recognised as obviously essential if lino crossing were to be avoided that there trust be some 'clearing house' for the operations of the two organisations. It was agreed   a as far as American S.O. was concerned Germany and Italy would be operated by the S.O.E. Mission .in London and not by Washington direct  b that the American S.O. Mission and the British S.O.E. headquarters should work in the strictest collaboration in regard to these two countries keeping each other fully advised as to progress and policy and that-they should endeavour as far as possible to allocate exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channeIs avallablo., 5  Sweden and Switzerland.  \ Special problem arise in connection with those two countries since they represent bases from which work can bo carried on into several areas.   a Sweden It was recognised that the American S.O. would wish to establish representation in Stockholm. It was pointed out by the British representatives that their present Mission in Stockholm was engaged on four separate functions nariely work into Norway work into Denmark where we work for S.I.S. as well as for ourselves and preparations for post-occupational work in Sweden itself and work into Germany. It was pointed out that whilst v/ith v/ork Into Germany the general principle laid down in paragraph 2. above could have been easily applied and would have involved no very close connection between tho American S.O. represonta tive in Stockholm and the British S.O.E. Mission there work into Norway Denmark and Sweden itself was a much more delicate business. As regards Norway it was clear that ' activities in this country must be governed by the arrange ments for invasion countries sot out in section A. dcove and that it would bo impossible for the American S.O. representative in Stockholm to operato any field force In Norway.  As regards tho other throe countries it was agreed that he should work in the closest possible collaboration and in accordance v/ith the general direction of the head of the British  S.O.E. Mission in Stockholm.  b Switzerland. Switzerland is a base for v/ork into Germany Italy and France. It was felt however that unlike Stockholm It would probably be sufficient it It v/ere agreed that any American G.O. representative in Switzerland should be operated by the American S.O. Mission in London and not by Washington direct and that the American S.O. Mission in London should in this connection work in the strictest collaboration with tho British S.O.E. headquarters each kooping the other fully advised with regard to progress and policy and that they should endeavour to allocate as far as possible exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channels available  With London thus being usod as a 'clearing house' it was felt that it would riot be necessary or pbrhaps not even advisable for the local representatives in Switzerland to have any connection v/ith each other., NO 3. 22nd Juno 1942  Record of Discussion ro s-rding collaboration between British and American S.O.E.  We set out hereunder a draft record of conversations which took place in the evening of Friday June 19th 1942 at which were present Colonel Ooodfcllow representing American  S.O. and Colonel Taylor Lord Olonconner Mr. Keswick and Captain Pleydcll-Bouvorie representing British S.O.L. The object of the discussion was to follow up earlier conversations as recorded in Record No. 1 of the 17th J'uno particularly paragraph .8 and to review the position in thaj area in more detail. The following summarises the con clusions reached  1. BALKANS AND MID EAST It was agreed that paragraph 8 of the record of the previous meeting constituted a fair record.  It was agreed in general that the form and extent of the American Mission and the activities which it might undertake should bo discussed between the British Head of  S.O.E. Mid East and a representative of the American S.O. and that their recommendations should bo referred to London and Washington for ratification. Regarding the reference in the earlier record to direct communication between Washington and the Hoad of the American Mission in Cairo it was agreed that all such telegrams whether originating from Washington or.Cairo should be repeated to the American Mission attached to S.O.E. London. It was also agreed that it would bo the responsibility of the . American Mission in London to keep British S.O.E. informed as to the content of all such messages which affect British interests. It was agreed that if the American Mission set up their own War Station in Cairo this would be used only for communications with Washington as the War Station belonging to S.O.E. Mid East is already adequate for handling all communications with agents in the field.  A discussion ensued regarding supplies of equipment from America to S.O.E. Mid East. It wa s pointed out that such equip ment comes under two categories namely   a Service Equipment including aircraft naval craft arms' ammunition medical stores building materials transport parachutes. containers clothing field telephones .and  b Non-Service Specialised Equipment including explosives sabotage devices W/T sots War Station and Broadcasting equipment etc. With regard to the former it was pointed out that S.O.E. is the British Government Department created for waging subversive warfare but that C.-in-C Mid'East is responsible for all operations, in that theatre of war. S.O.E. plans must therefore conform to C.-in-C's operational requirements and to the strategic requirements'of'the Chiefs of Staff They are therefore sub mitted to C.-in-G for his concurrence and in carrying thorn out  S.O.E. aro acting as his agents. It follows that all requests for equipment in this category must originate from S.O.E. Mid East who must look to C.-in-C Mid East in the first place for the facilities and stores required for operations which he has approved. If however ho is unable to supply S.O.E. Mid East advise S.O.E. London and if they cannot be obtained in the United Kingdom S.O.E. London must apply through the appropriate Ministry and Munition Assignment Boards to Washington. And it is at this stage that support from Colonel Donovan for such applications will be of the greatest value.  It was remarked that this-machinery has been sot up to enable the combined Chiefs of Staff to pool the resources of the United States and Great Britain and allocate them to the various theatres of war having regard also to transport facili ties  It was agreed that it will therefore be impossible for  S.O.E. Mid East to make direct application to the American S 0. for equipment of this typo. It was considered however that if the-American S.O. can become possessed of aircraft seacraft etc. it might be possible for them to send then to their own Mission in the Middle East and. place them at the disposal of the British S.O.E. organisation. In doing this howovor it would be necessary for the American S.O. to send their own crews and spares etc. so that the aircraft could be serviced as an independent unit and it is clear that.even this plan would involve negotiations with the military authorities in Egypt. Nevertheless it was agreed that S.O.E. London should make up a list of equipment in this category of which they stand in need and supply it to tho American S.O Regarding Non-Service Equipment it was pointed out that tho British S.O.E. aro themselves manufacturing all their own special devicos and W/T.sets. At the same tine it was agreed that there was a shortage of certain types of W/T sets and broadcasting equipment.  Accordingly it was agreed that S.O.E. London should make up a list of their requirements under this heading and supply it to the toerlean S.O. And it was agreed''that so far as this equipment was concerned there could be no objection to tho American S.O. either   a despatching it to thoir American Mission in the Mid East or '  b supplying it direct to S.O.E. Mid East. Regarding personnel it was explained that there is believed to bo a shorta go of W/T operators in the Middle East and that it v/ould be useful if say 10 trained W/T operators could bo attached to tho American Mission for work in the S.O.E. Mid East War Station'near Cairo. It was also pointed out that S.O.E. Mid East to-day recruits tho'raajority of its' Greek and Jugoslav personnel from thoir respective armies and that it was desirable to obtain nationals of these two countries and of Bulgaria Roumania and Hungary from other quarters. Such personnel should be trained as W/T operators and oes export organisers for, infiltration into occupied countries whore they can assist friendly elements to organise passive resistance sabotage and revolt.  2'. NORTH AFRICA  The position regarding this area as set out in Record No. 1 paragraph. 10 and Appendix 1 was also discussed on tho same occasion but only tentatively. Sir Charles Haribro dis cussed it again with Colonel Goodfollow on tho 21st Juno and in accordance with these discussions a draft proposal as sot out hereunder was drawn up for submission by the British S.O.E to their Chiefs of Staff and by the American S.O.E. to their authorities.  ''Since a compromise must be found tho following suggestion is put forward   1 North Africa including Spanish Morocco to be regarded as predominantly an American sphere of influence.  2 The American S.O. to establish the Mission for North Africa the head of which would bo responsible for S.O.E. activities in that area. The existing British organisation would continue and its personnel would remain administratively and operationally rosponsiblo  to a British hoad but the latter would .operate under the general direction and control of the American head of the Mission nahiidnery will bo set ut to this end.  h   3 General policy would bo agreed between Washington and London and instructions would be issued by Washington to the American Head of tho Mission a copy of any such agreed instructions would be sent from London to the II ead of the British organisation.  4 Gibraltar as an S.O.E. base from which supplies of arms and equipment transport facilities and W/T facilities are made available would remain outside the arqa. of t he North African Mission and under tho control of the Hoad of tho British S.O.E-. Organisation.  5 In order to ensure tho closest co-operation and liaison between the Mission and the local British Civil and Military authoritios machinery will be set up which will enable the Governor and C.-in-C Gibraltar and tho British Consiil General Tangier to exercise the necessary supervision and co-ordination 3. SPAIN AND PORTUGAL. In view of the fact that S.O.E. activities In Portugal  other than the use of Lisbon as a base for the creation of ' lines of communication into Franco have been practically re duced to nothing by the decision of th.. British Ambassador and the Foreign Office and of the fact that British activities in Spain arc to all intents and purposes directed and controlled by the British .Naval Attache in Madrid it was agreed that there was.no need to cone to a detailed agreement regarding collnbo ration between tho British and American S.O.Es in this territory in the course of tho present discussions. Such collaboration as was possible could bo worked out in duo course on the spot between tho present American S.O.E representative at Lisbon, 4  and Madrid or by his successor if ho were removed with the local British representatives.  It was indicated by the S.O.E representatives that it might be very convenient to have the American S.O. handle the few W/T contacts left to 'British S.O.E. in Portugal.  It was made clear that the section operating in Lisbon on lines of communication into Prance would not be included in any arrangements for collaboration In the Iberian Peninsula proper.  4. VJBST AFRICA With reference to paragraph 6 of the Record No. 1 of the 3.7th June it was explained by the British representatives that they had been asked by the Minister Resident Lord Swinton to make clear to him the relationship they expected would exist between him and any American Mission or Missions based on the territory within his charter and that they had confirmed to the Minister Resident that the situation would. In this as in other respects be analogous to that existing in Cairo and that the Head of the British Mission in West Africa would act as the link between any American Mission and the Minister Resident putting up to the latter the requirements of the American Mission and convoying the decisions of the Resident Minister to the American Mission  5 FINLAND  It was agreed that Finland should be regarded as an American sphere and that the British S.O.E. should place all facilities and contacts useful for this country at the dis posal of their American colleagues.  6. RUSSIA S.O.E. explained the position regarding their liaison mission In Moscow and their agreement with the N.K.V.D. that neither party would carry out reiy operations in the territory of the other except by mutual arrangement. It was agreed that as the American S.O. had no Intention for the present at least of dealing with Russia there was no need to work out any arrangements for collaboration for this area., NO. 4U 23rd Juno 1942.  Record of Discussion regarding collaboration between British and American S.O.E.  We set out hereunder a draft record of conversations which took place on Thursday 18th Juno 1942. There wore present Colonel Goodfollow representing American S.O. and Colonel Davies and Captain Pleydo11-Bouverio representing B ritish S.O.E.  The object of the discussion was to view the position regarding collaboration between British and American S.O.Es in connection with research development and production of equipment and devices.   . RESEARCH AND DEVELOPIIENT.  Colonel Goodfellow stated that Colonel Donovan had no research establishment nor did he intend to institute ono. They would place all their problems before the Scientific Advisory Council under the Chairmanship o f Dr. Conant.  Colonel Goodfcllow asked whether v/o had any requests as regards scientific research and he was informed that the  D.S.R. had supplied a list of items which night bo developed and it was thought as well to finish those before embarking on anything now. Colonel Goodfellow was informed that Major Freetth and Mr. Billinghurst were kept currently advised as to what we v/ore doing in this country and so far wo had had nothing in return. It would therefore be appreciated If this matter could bo taken up with Major Preoth as we were anxious to benefit by American research experience.  It was finally suggested that at an early opportunity representatives from the Radio and Dovioos Departments of Station IX should proceed to. America to discuss the kind of development which should bo proceeded with on both sides and so avoid duplication and over-lapping.  2. PRODUCTION Colonel Ooodfellow informed us that Mr Billinghurst and Major Preoth were now established in How York and were in fact managing his production programme f  Our conception of the relationship between S.O.E. and Colonel Donovan1 organisation in respect of supplies was then elaborated. It was suggested that there should be an interchange of production figtiros and that some kind of joint production planning should bo evolved. The modalities of this were not discussed in detail.  3. FINANCE Colonel Goodfcllow was informed that wo had cone to tho conclusion that it would be bettor to wipe out any kind of cash transaction between S.O.E. and Colonel Donovan's organisation and that each should supply the other with goods without charge and there would merely bo a sytom of recording types' and number of goods dolivorod., Colonel Goodfollow stated that ho had reckoned on cash transactions-and had in'-fact budgeted forward for the amount ho was likely to purchase from us but had not allowed for any goods we night obtain from him without'payment.  It was pointed out to him that if we indulged in cash transactions it would probably hold up supplies in view of the formalities which would have to bo undergone by loth sides as a result of the very complicated financial agreements between our respective countries.  It was suggested that Colonel Goodfellow should take the matter up with Colonel Donovan and that Colonel Davies should take it up with Sir Charles Hambro.  4. As a result of the above conversation a formula quoted hereunder was worked out between Colonel Davies and Y//Cdr. Vernier on behalf of S.O.E and submitted to Colonel Goodfollow and hr Atkins Finance Department of the War Office both of whom have indicated their agreement with it.   The Office of Strategic Services a nd the Special Operations Executive both produce ordnance which will be used in practically every case for similar operations if not in respect of joint operations.  Subject to S.O.E for its pfert having to obtain approval of interested Government deparbffiSjfitS' It is agreed that the foilwing is the best procedure to be adopted in the interests of 'both parties  Resources should be pooled wherever possible and machinery set up   a To determine jointly the types and quantities which each organisation should produce  b The allocation of such production to the various operational centres.  c As regards the question of finance such production it was agreed that each side should finance their own production and that whilst detailed records should be kept of thevdestinations of all issues there will be no payments or financial obligations a s between the two organisations or their respective Governments ., 1\T0. 5 25rd Juno 1042.  Record of Discussion regardIns collaboration between British and iimcrican S 0.B.  Vie sot out hereunder a draft record of conversations which took place on Monday 22nd June 1S42. There were present Colonel Goodfellow representing Rmorican S.O. and Ytf/Cdr. Vennor representing British S.O.E  The object of the'discussion was to view the position regarding finance.  At Colonel GoodfeHow s request W/Cdr. Vcnner gave a general outline of S.O.E. finance and stated that funds drawn from the British Treasury for S.O.E. expenditure were charged to the secret vote. While S.O.E. paid out of such funds the salaries of all officers the pay of Other Ranks was met from the open votes of the Service Departments. Stores and equipment other than those of a special or most secret nature were also supplied by the Service Departments without a charge falling on S.O.E. funds.  W/Cdr. Vonnor stated that a normal month s expenditure of S.O.E at the present time was about 550 000 covering operations throughout the world but that naturally in an organisation such as S.O.E the monthly expenditure was subject to much fluctuation dependent upon special projects and operations as they occurred and he informed Colonel Goodfollow that in thinking of such a figure in connection with S. 0/ . America he must bear in mind to what extent S.O. America would have to pay personnel and become liable to pay for stores &c. issued from Service sources.  Colonel Goodfollow stated that up to now S.O. America had been fina need from block grants from the President's secret fund but that now that it was becoming part of the Chiefs of Staff Department he was not 'certain what effect this would have in finance but he thought that grants v/ould be made from Army votes which would be in the nature of con fidential funds. He stated that all Army personnel. Officers included drew their pay from Service Departments.  A discussion then took place on tlje question of stores and equipment for use by the two S.O. organisations and W/Cdr. Vennor submitted a copy of the a ttachcd minute in regard thereto. Colonel Goodfellow expressed his agreement with the procedure outlined in this minute and took a copy with him stating that it would be most useful to him in making the corresponding arrangements whon he got back to America.  W/Cdr. Vennor then raised the question of Messrs. Proeth and Billinghurst s duties and Colonel Goodfellow stated that they wore acting in an advisory capacity and while they call for quotations and issue orders for materials Ac. from his office they had nothing to do with finance or accounting. W/Cdr. Venner stated that ho was glad to ha ve this confirmation since Messrs Preoth and Billinghurst were technical men and were not presumed to have the ability or responsibility of h andling financial and accounting matters., The Office of Strategic Services and the Special Operations1-Executive both produce ordnance which will be used in practically every cc.se for similar operations if not in respect of joint operations .  Subject to S-'.O.E. for its part having to obtain approval of interested Government departments it is agreed that the following is the best procedure to be adopted in the interests of both parties.  Hesources-should be pooled-wherever possible and machinery set up   a To determine jo.intly' the types and quantities which each organisation should produce  b The allocation of such production to the various operational centres. . c As regards the question of finance in respect of such production it was agreed that e ach side should finance their o wn production and that whilst detailed records should be kept of the destinations of all issues there will be no payments/ or financial obligations as between the two'organisations or their respective Governments, NO. 6. 25rd June 1942.  Record of Discussion regarding collaboration  . between British and -American S.O.E.  At their meeting of the 16th June the American represen tatives handed to the British representatives a memorandum on training which is quoted hereunder.  As then arranged this memorandum was passed to the British Directors concerned for their comments and these also are quoted hereunder. Prom these it will be seen' that as regards the ten out of the total of thirteen stations which are under the control of Brigadier Gubbins only a very sm all amendment to the proposals made by the American S.O. representatives is suggested whilst as regards the three stations which come under the control of Colonel Davies a somewhat different basis for collaboration than that implied in the original American memorandum is put forward.  TRAINING. American Memorandum   in the past three months several officers of the American S.O. organisation have been permitted to attend the British S.O.L. training school at Toronto Canada where the training was carried on along the lines of the Para- Military and Advanced Schools It is now considered extremely desirable that a la rge number of American Officers be permitted to attend the various specialized training schools in Great Britain and particularly is it considered essential that American S.O. Officers be detailed for short periods of time to the various operational stations and offices in England. This will hot only serve as a'means of training for the individuals concerned but will be a most powerful factor in insuring unity of doctrine and effort in the future operations of the two national S.O. organisations.

I attach drai't of the record of our conversations with Colonel Goodfellcrw.  I do not know whether I have correctly interpretated what was agreed regarding N.Africa and Portugal.  A few words were also said about Spain which I have not included. Nor have I made any reference to the point you raised for the W.African Mission as I am not quite sure that I would get it right.  '  Qi, aOfch June 1942  AD3/Ub/1466  ESCORD OP PURTHER DISCUSSION RIDG-ARDIHJ COLLABORATION BETWEEN BRITISH AND AMERICAN S.O.E. AT A MEETING HELD ON 19TH JUNE 1942.  Balkans and Mid East.  It was agreed that paragraph 8 of the record of the previous meeting constituted a fair record.  Regarding the reference therein to direct communication between Wash ington and the Head of the American Mission in Cairo it was agreed that all such telegrams whether originating from Washington or Cairo should be repeated to the American Mission attached to S.O.E. London. It was also agreed that it would be the responsibility of the American Mission in London  to keep S.O.E. London informed as to the content of all such messages which affect British interests. It was agreed that if the American Mission set up their own War Station in Cairo this would be used only for communications with Washington as the War station belonging to S.O.E. Mid East is already adequate for handling all communications with agents in the field.  A discussion ensued regarding supplies of equipment from America to  S.O.E. Mid East. It was pointed out that such equipment comes under two categories namely  a Service Equipment including aircraft naval craft arms ammunition medical stores building materials transport parachutes containers clothing field telephones sad  b Non-Service Specialised Equipment including explosives sabotage devices W.T. sets. War Station and Broadcasting equipment etc. etc. With regard to the former it was pointed out that S.O.E. is the British Government Department created for waging subversive warfare but that C-in-C. Mid East is responsible for all operations in that theatre of war. S.O.E. plans must therefore conform to C-in-C's operational requirements and to the strategic requirements of the Chiefs-of-Staff. They are therefore sub mitted to C-in-C. for his concurrence and in carrying them out S.O.E. are  acting as his agent.  It follows that all requests for equipment in this category must originate from S.O.E. Mid East who must look to C-in-C. Mid East in the first place for the facilities and stores required for operations which he  has approved. If however he is unable to supply S.O.E. Mid East advise -1, S.O.E. London and if they cannot be obtained in the United Kingdom S.O.E. London apply through the appropriate Ministry and Munition Assignment Boards to Washington. And it is at this stage that support from G.50 000 for such applicationsmll be of the greatest value. It was remarked that this machinery has been set up to enable the combined Chiefs-of-Staff to pool the resources of the United States and Great Britain and allocate them to the various theatres of war having regard also to transport facilities.  It was agreed that it will therefore be impossible for S.O.E. Mid East to make direct application to the American S.O.E. for equipment of this type. It was considered however that if the American S.O.E. can become possessed of aircraft seacraft etc. it might be possible for them to send them to their own Mission in the Middle East and place hem at the disposal of the British S.O.E. organisation. In doing this however it would be necessary for the American S.O.E. to send their own crews and spares etc. so that the aircraft could be serviced as an independent unit and it is clear that even this plan would involve negotiations with the military authorities in Egypt. Nevertheless it was agreed that S.O.E. London should make up a list of equipment in this category of which they stand in need and supply it to the American s.O.E.  Begarding Non-Service Equipment it was pointed out that the British  S.O.E. are themselves manufacturing all their own special devices and W.T. sets. At the same time it was agreed that there was a shortage of certain types of W.T. sets and broadcasting equipment. Accordingly it was agreed that S.O.E. London should make up a list of their requirements under this heading and supply it to the American S.O.E. And it was agreed that so far as this equipment was concerned there could be no objection to the American S.O.E. either   a despatching it to their American Mission in the Mid East or  b supplying it direct to S.O.E. MLd East. Regarding personnel it was explained that there is believed to be a shortage of W.T. operators in the Middle East and that it would be useful if say 10 trained W.T. operators could be attached to the American Mission for  work in the S.O.E. Mid East's War Station near Cairo. It was also pointed out -2, that S.O.E. Mid East today recruits the majority of its Greek and Jugoslav personnel from their respective armies and that it was desirable to obtain nationals of these two countries and of Bulgaria Roumania and Hungary from other quarters ouch personnel should be trained as W.T. operators and as  expert organisers for infiltration into occupied countries where they can  assist friendly elements to organise passive resistance sabotage and revolt.  finally it was agreed that the detail as to the form and extent of the American Mission and the activities which it might undertake should be discussed between the British Head of S.O.E. l Ld East and a representative of the American S.O.E. and that their recommendations should be referred to London and Washington for ratification. North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula.  It was agreed that North Africa with the exception of Spanish Morocco should be an America area to whicn an American Mission should be sent with headquarters say at Tangiers but that a British Mission would continue to function in Gibraltar.  Policy iahould be initiated in Washington in consultation with S.O.E. London and instructions would be sent from Washington to the American Head of the Mission repeated to the British laission in Gibraltar for their infor mation.  The initiation of plans for carrying out policy and the control of operations themselves in North Africa iwith the exception of the Spanish Morocco would be the sole responsibility of the American Head of the Mission. The British Mission would however provide the American Mission with sea transport for infiltrating personnel all stores and equipment required and put their War Station at the disposal of the American Mission for communica ting with agents in the field. They would also continue to control their own agents in Spanish Morocco.  It was also agreed that a committee should be set up presided over by  the Governor of Gibraltar and consisting of representatives of the American  and British Missions in order to ensure co-ordination.  Regarding Portugal it was agreed that this should be taken over by  the American S.O.E. and that they should become responsible for working with  the 3 W.T. sets which have already been placed.  -3, MOST SECRET . ADU/MS/ 17th June 1942. TO D PROM AD/U. / I attach notes on the various conversations I have discussed direct with G. In fact I have now covered all the ground except the New York Organization and the appointment of Louis Franck. Until I hear from C.D. again I am not bringing up the question with G. So far I have done nothing about the Agenda for G.50 000 AD/XX/2250 . There are a good many points in this but they chiefly concern other Directorates., MOST SECRET. ADU/AMS/127. 17th June 1942. TO G / PROM AI/G. Copies to C.D A.D. Xf I attach some notes on the. various poinfcs milch U and I ch. seussoC yesterday shovilng the various decisions arrived at., MOST SBCKST  17tH June 1942. 1. CARIBBEAN PLAN. 0 explained that owing to certain details in the plan wnioli he felt might be open to grave criticism from the American Chiefs of Staff he had arranged with Brigadier Dykes to withdraw this plan from circulation at the moment. He was however in full agreement that all possible steps should be taken to radicate the use of re-fuelling bases in the Caribbean by German submarines if in fact this was the case. He had already sent a special S.I.S. mission to that territory to establish what was the true position. In the meantime he thought that we should certainly discuss the matter generally with the Admiralty He handed us certain detailed criticisms of the plan which we are now considering with a view to re-drafting. This matter will not be dropped.  2. ARGENTINE A.M.A AD/U explained that he had seen Sir David Kelly who expressed the desire for a Liaison Officer with S.O.E. on his own staff and said that he had two officers whom he thought might be suitable They would naturally be trained   ACTION  by us before taking up the appointment. G. said that he was  - seeing Sir David Kelly shortly and would take up this matter with him. G. will let us know whether any definite appoint ment is agreed upon so that we may contact the necessary  candidate.  3. G.11.Q00.  I AD/UaskedG.whetherthereportsfromG 11 000onMs interview with Sohnake and other Chilean Government politicians had been Shown to Y.P. Santiago and whether Y.P. Santiago was in full agreement with .11 000 s activities. We pointed out also that G.11 000 Is a member of the Diplomatic Mission in Santiago and any interference in local politics by a member of the Diplomatic Mission might be taken as an expression of H.M G e policy. Sooner or later we would have to defend these activities with the Foreign Office and G. replied that G.11 000 was on very friendly terns with Y.P. and that he felt sure that the general policy had been approved by Y.P. but he was not certain that the actual report had been seen by Mm.  II 0. reported that G.11 000 was her and had definite proposals of a political nature which he hoped would assist in persuading Chile to break off diplomatic relations with the Axis. G. asked whether it was a definite Foreign Office policy that we should attempt to achieve this. AI/0 replied that under the Prime Minister s ruling we were unable to undertake any internal political activities without Foreign Office approval and it would be necessary therefore to dis cuss the whole matter with MSt them. It is important that G.11 000 should call at this office so that we may know exactly what his proposals are and so that he may return to his territory with the least possible delay.  4. SAFE KEEPING QF DWS IK TRINIDAD AND ELSEWHERE. G. assured AD/U that he was making the proper arrangements P.T.Q., id for tlie storing and custody of the large amount of stores  which had arrived or was about to arrive in Trinidad He  had obtained the services of a very reliable local resident  whom he felt sure would be excellent for the purpose  AD/U asked a his views on the success of Lingesssn s tour and the value of the reports received from him 0 replied that he thought the tour had been very useful and that the reports were of value and interest. Me hoped to be able to make further good use of Lingeman s services He had not heard any reactions good or bad from agents in the field as a result of Ling man s tour  6. P/H.8 G stated that while h/H.2 was performing extremely valuable work in America'in training recruits he felt that if he were needed for really important work in the field he could not stand in the way If therefore this was the case ho was prepared to release him and he would be available for  AC pi U. service in the Balkans within throe weeks U. undertook to confirm with the Balkans Section that this was the case  7. P.W.H. AD/U explained that P W E Headquarters In London had decided to send its own P W E Mission to the U 3 A Shis would be under the charge of David Bowes-Lyon. We had asked Bowes-Lyon what his ideas were for the future organisation in America Bowes-Lyon had intimated that P.W.E desired a separate office and would like to take at least two of G s S 0 Propaganda Staff  It was generally agreed that S 0 Hew York should remain P W E s agents in Hew York and that if Bowes-Lyon wished to make use of our organization he himself should work under G. in America If on the other hand P.W.E insisted on having their separate organization then we should say that we were unable to release our staff In ary case P W E. will want to make use of 0 0 communications  It was further agreed that it was necessary to retain G s Propaganda staff to attend not only to P W E s activities but also for work in South America which we anticipate carrying out in co-operation with the Ministry of Infcarnation. Liaison with P W D of the War Department which now comes under G 30 000 s control will also require to be carried on  8. FIMAKCS AD/U said that D/FIN. was most anxious to discuss financial matter with G and this would probably take about an hour. ICTIONI It was arranged that D/PIH. would make his own appointment with 6  9 W/T HETWORK -WESTERH HEMISPHERE.  It was arranged that this should be discussed in conjunction  CTIOHl with Al/Z and a time for this discussion will be arranged by AD/Z. G however handed us a rough estimate of costs which shows a total capital cost of /102 000 an estimated running cost of /8 Q00 per month It was agreed at this meeting subject, to AD/Z a Viewa tbat iix spite of the unhappy jcporienoea In the past in joint arrangements with for w/t oomunioafciono it would be advisable to have a joint arrangement in Amorlea Any past disadvantages of this  joint working having arisen elsewhere should be eliminated  in the Americas owing to the fact that both organisations worit unaer 0.  I IGHI This will have to be discussed with M but as far as the  m. ap/U Directorate is concerned it is felt that the time has  arrived when we should close the school Moat of our own agents have been through courses and 0 50 000 Is establishing his own schools It was agreed that S.T S 103 had been of immense value both to us and in starting the Americans off on the right line  is 0 s view that it is impossible at the moment to say what the fate of the 'school should be but he is very much against the immediate closing down He thinks that in some form or other it will have valuable duties to perform for some time  to coma He pointed out that as the main line station for communication with England was being erected at the school certain personnel would be required there in any case It is  our recommendation that this question should be definitely reviewed again on 1st August  11. LIAISOH WITH AMERICA IN REGARD TO MANUFACTURE STORAGE XiTp SHIFMENT 0 DEVigM We explained to 0 that this had been discussed thoroughly, between 8 f andAMUandwrittenminutes  had been prepared for Q T 3. to take back to jy&eriea wltb  a view to settlpg up the requisite maehlnsry for eoordlmting those supplies  as smfiQH m  6 felt timt we ould keep the Station In 'loronto available but agreed that it was impossible to urdortaice a genoral forgery ass lgn Se stressed fcue facilities  available and tiiouglit that tiiey mlgtxt be useful to us on tills side on occasions  ACflOSt in regard to the forging of Batik lotos.

I feel the right procedure would be to get the Americans to agree to the compromise before we submit it to the Chiefs of Staff. This will of course involve certain minor amendments to the attached paper. 3. If we do not adopt this course and the Americans fail to agree to the compromise we shall make ourselves look very foolish., S.O.E. ACTIVITY IN NORTH AFRICA ... .  GENERAL  1. RepreseatatIvoa of the British and U.S. organisations for special operations have been discussing joint cooperation throughout the world and as a result of these discussions a considerable measure of agreement has been reached except in the case of North Africa. BRITISH Vllv.'/S 2. British representatives suggested that North Africa should be regarded for the present as a British sphere of influence. If this principle v/as acceptable to their American colleagues the British representatives proposed that the whole of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa should be grouped together as a single mission with headquarters at Gibraltar and should be controlled from London. 5. The factors which influenced the British representatives in making these proposals were that a The present Allied O.-in-C. in this part of the world the Governor and C.-in-C. Gibraltar -is British.  b Gibraltar forms a natural base for such operations into North Africa.  o The present facilities for operations into North Africa are almost entirely British the W/T stations are at Gibraltar the supplies of arms and equipment and the shipping facilities for their introduction. Moreover some of these facilities such as the ships are not under the direct control of S.O.E. but of the British Naval and Military authorities.  d London is probably the better operational head quarters for controlling these operations at the present stage both from the point of vie / of distance and the facilities for consultation of the interested parties.  e The Iberian Peninsula is closely linked with North Africa since the British Ambassador in i. adrid V L has a direct interest in Spanish Morocco and an indirect one-in the French North African situation.. AMERICAN VIEWS  4. The tf.S. representatives expressed the view that North1 Africa should be regarded as a predominantly American sphere. They proposed that an American mission with headquarters at Gibraltar should control all operations under the direction of Washington. They felt that North Africa should be separated from the Iberian Peninsula and that separate arrangements should be made for Anglo-American cooperation in the latter area. nsdf'T.I ' .ijtf-cM eiv   5.

NOTE ON CONVERSATION tITH G.SO.OOQ.  1 I asked G.50 000 whether he approved my memorandum In principle which I had sent him through G. he replied that he did and that he had shown it to General Chaney who had also approved it. He was going to show it to Winant to-night or tomorrow to make sure that the State department were committed  I asked whether he would allow some members of his staff to get down to it with my staff'in order to s.gree the detailed arrangements by regions taking the general principles as their guiding note. He said that he would instruct Colonel Goodfellow to get in touch with AD first thing in the morning.  We then I'fen through the countries in which there might be any difficulties and it was agreed that thepEr East including China and Burma in so far as it was controlled from China were obviously American spheres of hfluence where the British Missions would work under the general guidance of  the Americans. It was also agreed that the Atlantic Island would be pre dominantly under American influence but special arrangements would have to be made in the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. G.50 000 explained that here  the. feelings ofthe State Department would have to be taken into consideration and also the fact that in Vichy France and in North Africa the Americans were more popular rdth the pencil and were.in a stronger position to put things over  then the British. He agreed however ' that for the present at any rate the general supervision of the Mission should be British with the head in Gibraltar with guidance coming from London and that the Americans on the spot although  they were officially controlled from New York would not take any action without authority either from London or the British head on the spot.  G.50 000 then said that he was going to withdraw G.50 Q0 homej he was afraid that G.50 200 would do both of us harm owing to his extreme un popularity with the State Department and the fact that his position was so well known to the Vichy authorities he feared he might blow both of us if left there and he had therefore decided to send Eddy back in his place. AB AD/W and AD/B must go very carefully when negotiating this situation and  must be broad minded on paper relying on the goodwill of those on the spot to make the machine work under the British supervision. Although G.50 000 agreed to what I said I am not sure that he was very happy about it and I think he would like to see things in a little more detail before finally  committing himself.  2 G.50 000 was very keen on Italy. He has sn expert on Italy and wants us to help him to infltrate and communicate from Egypt and Malta. He hasalso got some plan for attacking the Italian Feet at Taranto I think it is al together pretty vague and has been put up to him by one of his pals. I told him I would get one ofthe experts to talk to him about Italy and investigate how we could co-operate.  The head of the American Mission in the Middle East would probably be the late American Military Attache in Rome who has many acquaintances among captured\4rmy/Ttslian 0fficers.  5 As regards the Missions in London and New York his ideas were that he should have the Mission here with a responsible head working along side us but in addition to this he should send bitches of Officers say 10 to 15 at a time to get thoroughly acquainted in the way we did things and fcuireturn to America  to train his people. He was very anxious that they should see the way tre organised ourselves as if we were operating in the field and not as they do in America as if they held a nbig business organisation at their disposal. He  liked the way we made single tilings do our -work for us  'JIsjL tcLliujj fce. Iu-uju . l/ffe r 4 -Aii rngarde hi . ihIh . iftr'.i ftiwm cnmrnr-.qr hi on he agreed that he should concentrate on preparing American personnel with knowledge of languages to infiltrate into Europe and Africa just before or just behind the American Array proper. He felt that the maximum co-operation with the American Army was essential as he was now. under the direct control of the Chiefs of Staff. He, was therefore appointing a first class American S 0.E lielson Officer with the American Army headquarters over here.  5 I urged that his English Mission should be housed in the same building as ours on different floors. I stated that I thought I could provide them with accommodation if he would agree to is. He agreed that the two  as possible together hut I gather that he is   Jissions s as clo ---but  bins Me I.S. and S.O.E. Missions in the same   inclined t lea ofpu   building wo that we may not Be able to get what we want in this respect unless we can cajole David Bruce.  6 As regards our representation in New York he was very keen that  we should have a Mission working alongside him but I explained that ss far  as we were concerned G. was head of S.O.E. and I thought that all that was  necessary was to give G. a first class man with full knowledge of affairs  here to take charge ofS.O.E. administration under him and it would be up to G.S0 000 G. and. this man to agree how theiW fixed up their Mission in America.  I said that I thought 1 would be the best man to send as far as we were con  cerned He asked whether I had got G. s approval but I said that I had not yet put the question but I hoped he would help in putting the question over. He agreed to do so.  7 Finally it was agreed that I should circulate my memorandum to Ismay and Cadogan as having been agreed by hhim and he having agreed it with General Chaney would so the same thing with Win&nt.  3 He promised to instruct Goodfellow who would he his man to get in touch with AD so as to start discussions at 11a.m. tomorrow morning., 14th June 1942  I enclose herewith a copy of the documents that are Inside the letter to G.50 000 also enclosed .  Just before he left us last night 0.50 000 told ise that as he was lunching with Cheney tonorrow it would help to have sorte idea of what was in our rinds. As you know I carried him & good way in conversation during dinner so you may not think it necessary to go much further.

AGEM3A FOR G.  1 set out hereunder the subjects which as a result of the replies to the circular sent out to Directors appear to require discussion with 0. I am adding my comments as to how 1 would suggest they should be discussed attaching relevant papers.  1. ORGANISATION OP S.O.E. OFFICE IN NEW YORK AND S.O.E. MACxlINE GENERALLY IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  xhis involves the whole question of sending out Louis Franck to work under G. as officer in charge of S.O.E. activities in the Western Hemisphere. These discussions will of course have to be undertaken personally by you with G. There are no papers to be attached on the subject as we are quite clear about what we are aiming at and the whole subject must be a matter of rather delicate negotiation.  2. POSITION AS REGARDS S.O.E. ACTIVITIES IN SOUTH AMERICA. You will undoubtedly want to handle this question your self with G. putting him In the picture as to the way in which the situation is developing this end and hearing from him his view as to the probable course of events in Washington. It will also be necessary to reach agreement with him on the lines on which we should carry out the recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff which can now be regarded as having the approval of the War Cabinet. I therefore attach hereto at 2. the Chiefs of Staff paper in question.  We should also discuss with G. the immediate outlook in South America with particular reference to telegram No.   at 2b 104/105 of 9.6.42. I would suggest that apart from perhaps a general reference by you this matter can best be handled by A/DU.  3. FINANCE. D/FIN wishes to discuss finance with G. and I attach hereto at 3. his note on the subject.  4. W/T NETWORK FOR THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. The position regarding this problem is briefly set out in paragraph 8. of the attached memorandum from U. at 4. I suggest that this can best be discussed by G. with A/DU MS & A/DZ and that there is no need for you to worry about it unless they come up against some Issue of principle which must be decided by you., 2  5. LIAISON YifITH C 1H SOPTxl AlVlfiRICA. The position is as set out in a memorandum from A/DU attached at 5. I suggest that this can he left for A/DU to handle with  G. 6 FUTURE OF S.T.S. 105.  The situation in regard to this question is set out in three memoranda which ere attached two from G.T.l at 6a and 6b and one from MT at 6c . I suggest that you should leave it to A/DTJ and M to broach this subject with G. keeping you advised on the course of the discussions.  7. LIAISON WITH AMERICANS IN REGARD TO MANUFACTURE STORAGE AND SHIPMENT OF DEVICES. This arises out discussiore held with G.T.l a record of which is attached in a memorandum at 7. I suggest that discussions on this subject should be left to A/DU and A/DZ.  8. STATION M. This was another question raised by G.T.l and Is covered by a memorandum from U. attached at 8a. This can be left to A/DU.  9. ACTIVITY' PICTURES. This was another matter raised by G.T.l and the substance is given in a memorandum from U. attached at 9a together with copies of telegram from New York 99201 and telegram 2063 to  ew York attached at 9b.  10 S-O.E. IN PARAGUAY.  Substance of this matter Is covered by telegram No.04505 from New ork attaahed at 10 and discussion can be left to A/DU.  11. MASS MANUFACTURE OF PISTOLS FOR DROPPING OVER OCCUPIED TERRITORY. Substance of this matter is covered in No. 83819 from New York attached at 11a No.2021 to New lork attached at lib. No. 94628 from New York attached at 11c. and No.2079 to New York attached at lid. This can be left for discussion to M. and A/DU.  12 COOPERATION WITH M.O.I. IN LATIN AMERICA.  It has been agreed in principle that the M.O.I should send us some general suggestions as to how we can assist them. The substance of the matter is contained in a memorandum attached at 12. and the whole subject can be left for discussion to A/DU., ADU1/AMS/90 4.6.42. To AD/U. From AP/U.l  As a result of a letter dated. 1st June to O.B. from the Minister of Information in which he approves the suggestion that conversations between the South American organisations of S.O.E. and M.o.I. should continue U.l. and I today had an interview with Mr. Bonham Carter head of the Latin American division of the M.o.I  1. . ..'e explained that as our further consultations were now approved we wer6 anxious to co-operate in any way in which we could help M.o.I. in Latin America. Bonham Carter knew of the letter from his Minister to C.D. and had been instructed to get in touch with us for the same purpose. 2. He said that they particularly required assistance in activities which the M.o.I. could not undertake themselves. He mentioned securing the arrest of Axis agents whether by bribing the police or otherwise the bribery of other persons in the Police Press and Radio Services v/hom M.o.I. could not approach directly assistance in the spreading of rumours and contacting of minority movements particularly the Basques whom he consi dered to be one of the strongest influences in Latin America and the possibility of organising letter-writing campaigns by persons with relatives in Europe. He said that in certain cases the M.o.I. had been over ruled by the Foreign Office and prevented from pursuing projects which they had formed in Latin America.  Be added that he was in the process of writing a brief for S.O.E. setting out the lines on which they thought we could help them.  3. We agreed that we could certainly help the M.o.I. but we pointed out that for all action in neutral countries we are our selves subject to the F.O. ruling. We said that we would await his brief and then explain more fully what we could do immediately and in what respects we would have to approach the F.O. ourselves. 4. We then discussed the dissemination of rumours for which M.o.I. have their own organisation but it was agreed that we could be of great assistance in this work through our own channels and in countries to which their organisation does not extend. We pointed out that we should need to be fed with material which we are not at present receiving. The 'rumours which we now send to lew York from F.W.E. are for European pur poses and ..o.I. say that they have great difficulty in getting anything from P. W.E. specifically for Latin America 5. M.o.I. will in future send us copies of their weekly directives for Latin America and it was agreed that when we are able to start co-operating \ ith M.o.I. in the field we should instruct our agents that in addition to receiving specific rumours they should keep themselves informed of the M.o.I. directives sent each week to the Press Attaches in each country if they are not already doing so 6. Bonham Carter told us that M.o.I. are producing a detailed plan of propaganda for each Latin American country analysing the country /, country indicating the propaganda objectives and the means which it is proposed to employ against the various sections of each community. These plans will be approved by the F.O. and can then be taken as representing the policy of H.M.G. with regard to each country.  The plan of the Argentine is now in the hands of the F.O and those for Chile and Brazil are well advanced. As each plan is approved M.o.I. will send them to us and we expect then to be able to suggest other ways in which we may help  7. We referred to the possible suppression of Axis agents and it was agreed that though our list is probably fuller than M.o.I 8 they will let us have the names of their particular aversions 8 Bonham Carter concluded by saying that in any approach we had to make to the F.O regarding any project put forward by the M.o.I. we should have Mr. Grubb's full support and indeed if we  ever thought it would be of use to us to have the Ministry of Information's support for any of our own projects they would be glad to help us., //  LOCAL NO.465.

To AD/U From U  ACTIVITY PICTURES  The following has been reported to me by G.T.l.  In November G put forward a scheme for the production of activity pictures in Canada for dissemination in Latin and North America. This was agreed to in London subject to the approval of the produced article by London and this decision was conveyed to Major Maschwitz who went back together with an expert photographer to set up the S.O. machinery. While this was in the course of preparation G1 decided -in view of America's entry into the war and the cessation of our activities in North America -to drop this type of activity.  G.T. attached so much importanceto this activity that he offered to raise the necessary funds himself in Canada in order to carry it on. 'G' then said that if Col. Donovan'.s organisation was prepared to come into partnership with us and take responsibility for the production of these pictures he would be prepared to reconsider the situation. G.T. then put the proposal to Taylor Stanley and Barnes who are three of the top people of Donovan's F.I.S. side. These three were enthu siastic and perfectly willing to co-operate. A committee was formed consisting of these three G.T.l. and G.101 who were to supervise the production which would take place in Canada. I understand the type of subject which it is proposed to produce is as follows  1 Pictures alleged to have been taken by a Polish woman in a brothel in Poland into which she had been forced by the Germans  2 Pictures showing the ill-treatment and degradation of the Jews in Poland  3 Starvation scenes and prison scenes in Greece  4 Pictures of execution scenes in Poland and elsewhere. The distribution of these pictures was obviously the crux of the matter and we would be asked to help in the distribution of the film say from Lisbon Scandinavia and elsewhere.  G.T. states that 'G' himself is satisfied that this should be allowed to proceed and asked for our views., 'U/us/1799 26.5.42.  To AD/U From U.  Reference the attached record of a conversation with G.T. there are obvious points of high principle involved.  I also found out in conversation that while the three members of G.50 0001s organisation were in enthusiastic agreement they had not consulted Sherwood the head of the F.I.S. or Donovan. This seems to me an obviously very dangerous position as if an exposure occurred in North America Donovan could completely disown any arrangement we might have made.  I am not at all clear as to the value of this type of activity and I feel that if the Americans want this sort of thing to ingress their own people they should produce it themselves and we should not in any way be connected with it. If however it is thought that M.o.I. think as I have some reason to believe they might that such stuff would be useful in South America there is some reason why we should continue with it though I am doubtful if the  M.o.I. would agree to use faked material of this sort. It seems to me that we should discuss this with G when he comes over as I have a feeling that he is not fully aware of the facts that I have given., lyir  LOCAL NR. 553 CIPHER TELEGRAM DESPATCHED TO NSl YORK.

TP AT t 08.16 2.6.42. J.C., U/US/1800 26.5.42. To AD/U. Fromi U.  G-.T. also raised the broad question of Station 'M .  Station MI was set up in Canada and is in a position to produce any type of paper printing or forgery required. Its use has been discussed with the G.50 000 organisation who in theory are very keen to use this weapon but in practice -like most of us -have no concrete suggestions to make of the method by which it should be used.  G.T. asked if we had anybody here who specialised in this type of work and I replied that any work of this sort would be initiated by the Country Section concerned and in occupied territories in conjunction with P.W.E.   I think that the Americans loo upon it as an attractive toy but I personally feel that while it would be useful to keep the facilities available it is not possible to set out on a deliberate career of wide-scale forgery. Opportunities may occur from time to time whereby a specific operation can be carried out.  I do not know if you would like to raise the question of the utility of Station M at the Directors Meeting and whether we should give any assistance or directive to the Americans as to the way in which operations of this nature would assist us. I feel it very doubtful that anything of this sort could be done., 4th June 1942.  MINUTES OF A MEETING HELD IK AD/Z S OFFICE TO DISCUSS T'-flC QTTTUnTION or6eneral Liaison t3et een s.o.e. London and s.o.u.y. REGAPb to MANUFACTURE STORING & SHIPPING OF DEVICES.  The following were present t   AD/S AD/Z.l.  G.T.l. AD/U. S.  1 It-was decided that liaison in respect of toys devices between our two organisations should be done direct with G.T.l and E. Wireless equip ment is to be dealt with by B/Y Section. As and when ifi forwards information to G.T.l he will then decide what information should be passed on to G.50 000. S.O.E. London will not deal direct with any Americans either in Great Britain or U.S.A. Action. 2 Liaison with Commandos. on his return to New York c.T.r. G.T.l.will pursue enquiries in regard to Commando training and will advise London. Action. 3 It was laid down that we should advise the Ministry G.T.l. of Supply as to the address of our office in the United States i.e. Director of Security Co ordination Room 3553 630 Fifth Avenue New York City and also arrangements made between S.O.E. and G.50 000's organisation in respect of supplies. E undertook to see that the Ministry of Supply advise the British Purchasing Commission over there and G.T.l will also contact them so that the whole matter is tied up. Action. 4 It was suggested by G.T.l that a joint committee U T.1. consisting of G.50 000 s representatives and G s representatives should be formed so as to co-ordinate supplies coming from North America. G.T.l undertook to discuss t his with G and he will advise us.  5 Plastic Explosive. G.T.l and E visited Dr. Armit of the Ministry of Supply on the 30th May to discuss the question as to whether G.O.E. London or Canada would be able to obtain supplies of Plastic manufactured In Canada. In brief it was laid down that London would be responsible for the allocation to British Forces of all the Plastic Explosive made in England and Canada and conse quently should we require supplies then the indent should go to the Ear office and in turn they will pass it on to Dr. Armit who would arrange alloca tion. G.T.l however voiced the opinion that the Canadian authorities wish to allocate their own supplies but Dr. Arnxit stated that he would be responsible and not Canada. should G.T.l however require merely a few hundred lbs. for training purposes he would no doubt be able to draw this locally from the Canadian manufacturers. Action 6 Subject to security it was thought desirable that G.T.1 both sides should pool their production and, Action G.t.I  Action  G.T.l  Action  0.7.17  Action. &T /  Action.  E. Action. E .   9   -2   conseouently both America and England should be informed of their respective production possibil ities. It was agreed therefore that we will send our figures to G.T.l who in turn trill obtain the American figures and forward them to us. Tfhen this information has been exchanged we can decide as to what devices will be manufactured in each country.   7 G.T.l asked whether trained personnel who have had operational experiences could pay visits from time to time. it the moment he pointed out that It Is not necessary but he envisaged t at it would be most desirable at some future date.  P Wireless. G.T.l pointed out that there existed an enormous production field in America and was of the opinion that we should send a fully trained man out to act as adviser on manufacture. a'D/7 pointed out that we could not spare trained men from -Station IT so C.T.J stated that flea York could very easily take on a first class man and he would then send him over here for training so that he could later return to take over this work.  9 Finance. In oagland supplies of toys and devices etc. are paid for out of sr Office funds and the-question arises as to hat the procedure will be in regard to payment of stores supplied to us by the Americans and vice versa. As we do not pay for supplies we will not charge the Americans and S.Q.T.T. will approach G.5Q Oho with a request for him to approach his Finance Officer to see whether similar arrasgmorits can be made at.his end. In the meanwhile l after diseussion/3/STN will inform N.G.O. F.A. that we shall be supplying the Americans with stores in future.   10 Shipping goods ex Canada and America. G.T.l. will undertake to make suitable arrangements and will advise A/DU as to the outcome.  .11 It was suggested that there should be a permanent Liaison Officer dealing with the general question of supplies of toys and devices who should visit the U.S.a. at periodic intervals. AD/2 will endeavour to find such a man. .   12 Inorder to ensure that there is no loss of time it was decided that G.T.l. and I should be in direct telegraphic communication.  13 A monthly letter is pro ueed by Station XII which is then passed to AD/f.l and after vetting same forwards it to G.50.000. AD/ .1 will now pass this letter on to s who i ill forward it direct to G.T 1. It is also understood that 1 will send to G.T.l copies of drawings and literature which he considers is of interest.  14 Samples of made-up Gharges. G.T.l requested that a ifull rans e of dummy samples together with liter ature should be forwarded to rf.T.S.103. 1 Undertook to see that they would be sent., 4 ihiA  GTi/oH/1840. 5.6.42. To AD/U. Copy for G. -held for arrival From G.T.l.  Copy for M. in London I have noted the memoranda passing between you and M as well as the telegram sent 'G1 in reference to S.T.S.103. I hope the following facts and opinions will be helpful when further discus sion takes place.  1. The School has admirably served three purposes a It has trained a considerable number of S.O.IT.Y officials and G-land agents.  b It was almost the only means by which the Q1 organisation could have been persuaded to open similar schools and its facilities speeded this development by many months. It also was of inestimable value in developing liaison not only with 'Q but F.B.I. as well. The'School officers by ability and tact did a splendid job in furthering Anglo-American relations.  c It enabled S.O.N.Y. to establish the main station of its communications network with absolute security and also to train W/T operators. Now with regard to the future   a Almost all S.O.N.Y. officials and important agents have now been trained and further training requirements depend on an extension of activities of the type envisaged in   G s telegram 47 -50 inclusive. With any such develop ment a reasonable possibility it would seem desirable to postpone a 11close-down decision.  b It is quite true that Q schools are in operation but they lack trained instructors and I foresee the likelihood of Col. G.H. Williams realising this when he completes his present mission and that as a consequence he will ask for additional help. Furthermore other U.S. bodies such as F.B.I. are apt to request the use of our facili ties and we should be able to serve them.  c The W/T network has every chance of being a large-scale operation. A transmitter house has been erected at S .T.S.103 and in it will be two transmitters 10 k.w. and 2 k.w. standby as well as accommodation for four operators. If the proposed receiving and interception operation develops we may need to build a house and quarters however if the school proper is closed some of the present buildings could be used for this purpose . By August 1st the school vail have trained some 25 W/T operators. Regardless of the future the W/T operation has already proceeded so far that while training may cease the property must be maintained. 2. The decision may be to maintain S.T.S. 103 'as is' for the moment. However the decision may be to close down training and maintain only the W/T operation. In this event personnel changes will be necessary. Obviously the decisions involved are for 'M but my views thereon may be helpful. The Adjutant Capt. Bushel is a highly competent officer and quite capable of acting as 0.0. should G.T.2 and G.T.3 be brought back to the U.K. Oapt. James Adams R.O.S. is doing a most satisfactory job and I know that G.142 desires not only to keep him in charge of the technical phases of the operation but to extend his responsibili ties as the network grows provided 1M' is agreeable. Capt. Adams would /, -2   would be fixLly competent to act as 2 i/c to Oapt. Bushel. Oapt. F.S. Milner will no longer be necessary if the school is closed but I should point out that Ool. Williams would welcome his services on a temporary basis having already spoken to me twice on this subject.  3. On the basis of the school closing down O.R. personnel could be treated as follows - The S.M. and sergeant instructors including W/T could be returned to U.K.  Present staff of about 30 could be substantially reduced.  4. Finally there are in my judgment most important security and policy reasons for keeping at least a part of the operation in existence. S.T.S. 103 is the only secure place we have in  1-land for highly secret stores. While in London I have asked for many samples of various stores devices camouflage etc. Such could not possibly be sent to the U.S. without serious risk of exposure and we are fortunate in having such arrangements with the Canadian authorities that goods of this kind are admitted without any examination or detailed customs entry., OTi/cjj/1854. 8.6.42.  To' U. Copy to i&/Z From G.T.l In answer to your general query concerning the present status of the wireless developments at S.T.8.103 I give you the following facts   1 There has been erected at 8.T.S.103 8.T.8 103 layout in possession of MT a transmitter house approxi mately 45 x 23 ft. in size. This house will hold one 10 k.w. transmitter and fox standby use one 2 k.w. transmitter which has already been installed and I think is in operation. The transmitter house has in addition to the space for the transmit ters a modest but adequate store-room and sleeping and toilet facilities for 4 operators.  2 v/hen I left Canada the iignals Officer at 8 T. 8 103 who is in general charge of the installation under the direction of 0.142 waa erecting aerials which were beamed at the tl.K  3 i.T. .103 has already trained approximately 18 operators. These operators were recruited in Canada and have been passed out as fully competent by the Signals Officer. They have been ham operators for many years and all are competent to build install and operate wireless equipment of almost any size. In addition to these it is intended to recruit another 10 or 12 operators and give them the same kind of training which con sists of security weapons unarmed combat map reading and of course a general refresher on all phases of //T work with parti cular emphasis on interception codes and ciphers and the little tricks of 5.0. and 8.1.8. secret operations.  4 Purpose of the operators is threefold a to operate the Station at S.T.8.103  b to carry on Interception work  c if and when final plans are developed to move into  Latin America and operate our secret stations which  may be cloaked under Legation or Embassy cover to do  interception work in these localities and to tr4ain  local agents.   5 It ms the intention to do all cipher work in the Hew York office with messages being fed to and fro on the T.K. secret wire connecting 3.G.H.Y. and Ottawa a loop being thrown into 8.T.8 103 which is practically on the direct line between the two points.  6 It is my understanding that O.T.S.IOJ i/T Station is to be the main line station of a possible Western hemispheric wireless group. The final details of this group have not been established and I am afraid that any indication of the line it 'Is to follow would have to come from G.142 because as is obvious many changes may have taken place since 1 left New York.  7 It is my understanding that this operation as far as capital cost is concerned is a 3ointment between 8.0. and 3 1 3 and that operating costs will be decided by usage as between the two organisations.  8 There has been some discussion between Ab/U and M concerning the possible cloying down of S.T.S 103. In a memorandum to AD/f I pointed out that the f/T development at S.T.8.IO3 has already advanced so far that while the School may be closed down it seems that the n/T operation could not be and that some provision for its maintenance must be made.  9 //, 2   9 Xou asked me specifically concerning reception on this side and transmission from here to 3.T.S.IO3. 1 regret to say that 1 am completely Ignorant oh this stage of the operation and can give you no advice., MT/856  6th June 1942  To -M  Prom -MI  Visit of Gr and G-.50000  Reference MS/MX/57/MG dated 6.6.42.  Prom IvIT Section point of view the chief item for discussion is the future of S.T.S.103 and the Instructors and staff there.  I am strongly in favour of closing the school and re-calling the British Instruction staff within the near future for the following reasons  1. I consider that we have now given all the help which S.T.S.103 can provide to G.50000's organisation. 2. Should G.50000 require further Instructors to be trained they would presumably be specialist Instructors who should receive more thorough training than can be given at S.T.S.103. They should therefore be sent to England for training here at the proper school. 3. Col. Garland-Williams told me when I was in the United States that he would be sending no further parties to S.T.S.103 in any case. 4. I understand that no furtherJL . operators or officers will be trained at S.T.S.103 for oorroparSticm in the western hemisphere. It has been ruled that Post-occupational work in Canada comes under the control of the Army and not S.O. and therefore there will presumably be no requirements for training Canadian personnel.  5. It would not appear that the training of as P.B.I. Canadian- Mounted Police and the P.W.D. are a proper commitment for this Section. As to the disposal of the training staff I suggest that at the conclusion of the present course all Instructors should be re-called to England with the exception of Maj. Brooker who should be permitted to remain for one or at the most two months more tp assist Col. Garland-Williams.  As the communication station at Toronto seemsto be much more an S.J.S. than an S.O responsibility and as now we also require Signal Instructors very urgently in this country I do not consider that Capt. Adams should remain in Canada.  Should G. require to use the present school Other Rank Adminis trative Staff or use at the Wireless Station I see no objection from the point of view of this section nor is there any objection to the retention of the present Adjutant Capt. Bushel with them., ADU/AMS/29 l6th May 1942.  To O.D. From AD/U.  Oo-operation with 11Q11 In South America  There is no doubt that in theory the desirability of using  C to obtain all our intelligence for us is sound. The reasons are so obvious that they do not need'recapitulation.  In practice however there are many difficulties. The main one is that while we are agreed that it is desirable and  0 here are also in agreement our New York office would most undoubtedly say that the O organisation south of the Orinoco is quite incapable of doing our intelligence work. I quote from a report to G from G.100 dated February l8th   For the time being the principal task would appear to be the collection of intelligence. .In view of the fact that in Argentina ' Chile Bolivia and Peru S.I.S. have no intelligence organisation which is worthy of the name the task of providing this intelligence will naturally fall upon the various 8.0. representatives.  In any case however 8.0. intelligence would appear of necessity to be more all-embracing than 8.I.S. intelligence since S.I.S. in those countries do not in a general way consider that they are concerned with political intelligence and appear to confine themselves primarily to what may be called police intelligence i.e. dealing with personalities rather than movements and tendencies.11  It does not seem likely that we shall persuade-G by cable that 0 is in fact capable of doing this work and the only practical solution is to let C persuade him when he comes over here. I do not think that there is any doubt that the 0 organisation will need a great deal of strengthening before it is in a position to render us the service that we shall want.  The financial provisions in s draft telegram were entirely his idea and are ridiculous. Any financial readjust ment that might be necessary would have of course to be arranged here., MOST SECRET  ADU/AMS/25. 13th May 1942.  To O.D. From AD/U.

Organisation in South America  In view of our recent conversations and the conversations at lunch yesterday with other members of your organisation I was left with the impression that S.O.E. wishes to continue to control their South American organisations through 48000.    I  I am wondering whether you would agree to our both sending a telegram to our representatives in South America on the following lines -   IIThe following instructions to their representatives in South America have been agreed on by S.I.S . and S.O.E. headquarters.   A. S.I.S. is responsible for obtaining all intelligence including intelligence required by S.O.E.   B. If any area is insufficiently covered for the requirements of S.O.E. their local representative will ask S.I.S. to strengthen the organisation where required and if necessary indicate suitable persons for agents. Such agents should be contacted by S.I.S. organisation and if considered suitable for employment should be engaged and paid out of S.O.E. funds if agents are employed principally on collecting their intelligence.  0. Any S.O.E. intelligence service at present in being in South America should be turned over to the local S.I.S.man who should continue to employ the agents if considered suitable  S.O.E. providing the funds.  D Anyqperation which may be carried'out by S.O.E. in future should be communicated by the S.O.E. representative con   1 ducting the operation to the S.I.S. representative in the area in order that the latter may take steps to safeguard the intelli gence organisation either lay withdrawing his agents temporarily from the area or by any other suitable means.  Do you think your department would agree to sending a similar telegram to your local representatives and to 48OOO who controls them You will probably readily agree that it is not much use our sending a telegram unless you send one also and 48OOO must be told all the general principles., 2   operatore in the various countries. This was to be a joint 8.0 and 0. venture. We then asked for financial details and whether S.O. was committed New York replied that 3.0. was not in any way committed but that it was felt that we should bear a fair proportion of the cost. We replied agreeing and asking what proportion New York considered 8.0. should carry. They replied 50 of capital cost.  All the figures that are available at the moment are as follows  Capital cost  3 Main line Stations at 20 000 60 000 300 Suitcase Bets at l60 as ZfigpOO  130 000  Running costs  3 Main line Stations at 600 per month 1.800 p.month  30 British nationals in field at 160 per month -4.800 6 600 New York also anticipate employing an unknown number of  foreign nationals in the field. \  The position is very undetermined at the moment and I feel that we should discuss it with 'O' to settle the ' following points  1. Is it intended to use the network for routine commu nications as soon as set up or only in case of emergency. 2. Is it intended to use the Toronto Station for communication with S.O. London 3.

The following io a fairly full summary of the agreement reached in the course of discussions between officers of the British S.O.E. and the American S.0 between the 16th and 22nd June 1942.  This agreement was confirmed by Sir Charles Hanibro on the one side and Colonel Donovan on the other on the under standing that it would be submitted by the former to the British Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office and by the latter to the American Chiefs of Staff at the State Department for their approval.  The principles on which this Agreement are based are -as followss   1. Co-operation at Headquarters London/Washington The object of such co-operation is to achieve a common policy and to avoid crossing of lines in regard either to policy or to the supply of materials. For this purpose close liaison between headquarters is essential.  This liaison will be effected by a British liaison section working alongside Colonel Donovan's headquarters in Washington and a similar American liaison section working alongside S.O.E. Headquarters London. The duties of this liaison section would bo  a To represent the views of their respective headquarters on all policy matters so that a common policy for every theatre can be decided on.  b To discuss with the headquarters to which they have been accredited. cases of dispute in the field which have been .referred to that headquarters.  c To exchange information and to keep thoir headquarters fully informed of matters of interest.  d To qor-ordinate the production demand and supply of equipment from British and U.S. sources.  e To exchange both operational and technical in telligence and information on methods of training.  Such a liaison section might consist of one head liaison officer v/ho would bo a high level roprosentative charged with executive functions supported by requisite staff., f  2  2. CO-OPlORATION IN THS FIELD It i essential to avoid the situation where there will ho two completely independent organisations working in the field with all the consequent dangers of crossing of lines competition for agents and material etc. and inviting attempts hy foreign governments or groups with whom both organisations would ho dealing to play one off against the other.  In some cases the problem will ho dealt with by assigning a given region exclusively cither to the American or British organisation the organisation which agrees to stay out being represented at the most only by a liaison officer and a small staff.  There will however bo very few of these simple cases and in most areas the position will be that whilst an area is pre dominantly a British or American sphere of influence both countries will have some interests inside it and will need to establish some sort of representation and possibly a system of agents..  It is agreed that the general principles to be adopted in such cases should be  a Each area should be defined as being cither a British or American area.   To bo inserted at the request of the Foreign Office It is understood that in allocating an area predominantly cither to the British or American organisation a main consideration will bo tho system of military command pre vailing in the area in question. Thus normally where the local command is American tho area will -unless some special over-riding consideration applies -be allocated to American S.O.. whore tho command is British the allocation will.be to tho British S.O.E.  It is further understood that such allocation will be re viewed in the light of any development in the military situation thus a change in command from American to British or vice versa will be followed by a corresponding change in tho allocation of tho area.  b Inside a British area it will be agreed that the control and direction should be British and that the policy should bo laid down and all instructions to the Mission or Missions in that area should be issued from London. In an American area the same procedure would apply as regards Washington.  c In the field in a British area there would be a British Mission the head of which would be Controller for the whole area and who would look for his direction and instructions to London If the Americans so wished there could be an American Mission in the same territory which would have its own headquarters its own stations and its own agents but tho American Mission and its head at those headquarters would work under the direction and control of the British con troller. The hoad of tho American Mission could report direct to Washington on any matter he wished with a copy to the American liaison mission in London but ho would receive his instructions from London and through'the British controller and would only act on communications received direct from Washington with the agreement and consent of the British controller. In an American territory tho same principle would apply with the roles reversed.  d In the event of a difference of opinion arising botxTOon tho British or American controller and tho head of the British, -3  or American Mission inside his territory which could not  he settled locally the issue would he referred to London or Washington respectively and it would he the responsi   hility of the headquarters in question to settle it with the liaison mission attached to itt  Even these rather general principles may not ho able to he applied strictly in all eases and it may he nec essary to make exceptions in certain countries to meet special requirements. y  It was agreed that the following areas could he allocated in accordance with the foregoing principles without raising any vory serious problems.  1. INDIA It was agreed that India should he regarded as a British area where all operations would he carried out by the British Mission with control being exercised from London. The American S.O. would have the right to send out a liaison mission to he attached to the British Mission for liaison purposes hut not for operational purposes.  2. CHINA It was agreed that this area of which the headquarters would he at Chungking and which cover the whole of China in cluding Japanese-occupied China Manchuria and Korea should he regarded as an American sphere of influence. The American Mission would he established at Chungking and would direct all S.O. activities in this area. It would ho controlled from Washington. The existing British Mission at Chungking would he reduced and would he turned'into a liaison mission attached to the American Mission. The British liaison mission in addition to its liaison duties would render any assistance which it could to the American Mission hut only at the latter s request and under the letter s control.  3. AUSTRALIA It was agreed that British S.O.E. would have no res ponsibility for and would take no action in the area covered by General MacArthur's Command and that of the American Naval Command in the South Western Pacific. This area would he considered as covering New Guinea and the islands of the Bast Indian archipelago up to and including Java and Borneo. It would he for the American S.O. to make its own arrangements with the I.S.D. which already exists in Australia under General MacArthur's control. British S.O.E. would continue to give any assistance asked for to this Mission.  1 . To ho inserted at the request of the Foreign Office  BURMA  It was agreed that Burma should ho a British area hut that American S.O. should have the right to work into it as convenient from Chinn.  5. SIAM. INDO-CHINA. MALAYA AND SUMATRA It was agreed that those areas should he regarded as a no-man's-lnnd which could ho worked into os convenient by the British S.O.E. Mission in India the American S.O. Mission in China and I.S.D. in Australia. Line crossing inside this, -k   nrcn would hnvc to to nvoidcd Toy close Unison 1 Gtwoon those  three missions.  6. EAST AFRICA It was agreed that the area covered Toy the British S.O.E. Mission which already exists with its headquarters at Durban charged with working into Madagascar and Portuguese East Africa should ho regarded as a British area. American S.O would have the right to have a liaison mission attached to  the British Mission at Durban.  7. WEST AFRICA -PRAVi'EST and NEUGOLS Whilst it was agreed that the area covered by these two existing British S.O.E. Missions -namely the West African colonies from the southern boundary of Morocco to the boundary of South West Africa with Portuguese West Africa -should for the time being bo regarded as predominantly a British sphere it was recognised that the American S.O. had a very definite interest in this area since if any military action on a larg scale were to be undertaken by the United Nations in West Africa such action would predominantly be the responsibility of the American military authorities. The American S.O. therefore consider that they must place themselves in a position to be able to carry out S.O. services for the American Command if such a situation should arise. The following procedure was accordingly agreed upon.  American S.O. would establish Missions corresponding to our Prawcst and Neucols Missions. The programme of these American Missions would be worked out in as much detail as possible between Washington and London. Copies of this agreed programme would then be sent to the Heads of the American Missions and the Heads of the British Missions with clear instructions in both cases that the execution of this programme by the American Missions would be discussed step by step with the Hoads of the British Missions and no action taken until agree- ment had been reached with them. If such agreement could not bo arrived at the point at issue would be referred to headquarters to be settled between London anc Washington and until decision was given no action would be taken by the American Missions. It was con templated that the programme which would be worked out between London and Washington for these American Missions would be essentially preparatory in character consisting of the placing of American representatives at appropriate points the establishment of dumps of materials the collection of information and operational intelligence and the working out of plans against appropriate targets.  It was agreed that as had already boon arranged with the Minister Resident the situation in West Africa would as regards him be analagous to that existing in Cairo and that the Head of the British Mission in West Africa would act as the link between any American Mission and the Minister Resident putting up-to the latter the requirements of the American Mission and convoying to them the decisions of the Minister Resident  8. ATLANTIC ISLANDS It was agreed that those islands comprising the Azores Madeira the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands should bo regarded as an American sphere and operated by an American Mission controlled from Washington. The British S.O.E. would have the right to attach liaison officers to the AmericanA., -5     ...... . ..  organisation.  9. FINLAND It was'agreed that Finland should.he regarded ns an American sphere and that the British S.O.E. should place all facilities and contacts useful for this country at the disposal of their American collcnguesv  1Â°. RUSSIA-   S.O.E. having explained the position regarding their liaison mission in Moscow and their agreement with the  N.K.V.D. that neither party would carry out any operations in the territory of the other except Toy mutual arrangement it was agreed that as the American S.O. had no intention for the present at least of dealing with Russia there was no need to work out any arrangements for collohoration for this area ' A more detailed agreement was come to in regard to the following areas which present somov/hat complicated problems.  1. BALKANS and THE MIDDLE EAST It was agreed .that in view of the fact that all Military Commands in this area were British Commands that the principal political authority was the British Minister of State at Cairo'and that the whole of the territory other than Turkey -within which and from which operations could take place or he based -was wholly or partially under British military occupation the area at present covered by the British  S.O.E. with its headquarters at Cairo should be regarded as predominantly a British area. At the same time it was appreciated that there were many ways in which the American S.O. could be of great assistance in this area It could call upon resources in regard to equipment materials and possibly personnel which were not available to the British S.O.E. and in certain area -for example Turkey and Iran - American personnel could in some respects operate more easily than British personnel. It was accordingly agreed that the set-up should be as foHiowa -   The controller of the existing British S.O.E. Mission would be regarded as being in charge of all S.O.E. operations in that area and would be responsible for all S.O.E. activity to the local authorities -particularly the S.O. E. Sub-Committee of the Minister of State's. War Council -and to headquarters in London. An Amorican S.O. Mission should be set up in Cairo with the.object of providing such assistance as it could to the British S.O.E. and of contributing to the British  S.O.E. services which would only be available from the American side. The form and extent of the organisation of tho Ameriqan Mission and also the scope and character ' of its activities -would be discussed and settled by tho Head of the American Mission with the British Controller under whom he would be   working. In the event -of failure to reach agreement the issue would be referred to headquarters to be settled between London and Washington and in the meantime the views of the Controller would prevail. The Head of the American.Mission would communicate direct with Washington on any matter ho pleased but it would bo clearly laid down that as regards any action the American Mission would look to the Controller for direction and instructions and would take no action except with,    6  i.ls approvol.  With regard to ouch cor.raunicntions hetv/een Washington and the Head of the /.merican Mission in Cairo it was agreed that all such telegrams -whether originating from Washington or Cairo -should he repeated to the American Mission attached to S.O.E. London. It was also agreed that it v/ould he the responsibility of the American Mission in London to keep British S.O.E. informed as to the content of all such messages which/'affect British interests. It was agreed that if the American Mission set up their own War Station in Cairo it would he used only for coramunicatione with Washington as the War Station belonging to S.O.E Mid-East is already adequate for handling all communications with agents in the field.  The substantial effect of this arrangement would be that there would be a single S.O.E. machine in the area at the head of which would be the present Controller but that under him there would be two organisations namely the existing British S.O.E. organisation covering the whole area of the Mission and a small American organisation which would be fitted by the Controller into the general programme wherever it could help.  In regard to the question of supplies of equipment from America to S.O.E. Mid-East it was pointed out that such equipment comes under two categories namely  a Service equipment including aircraft naval craft arms ammunition medical stores building materials transport parnchutos containers clothing and field telephones and  b Non-Sorvicc specialised equipment including explosives sabotage devices W/T sets War Station and broadcasting equipment otc.  With regard to the former it was pointed out. that S.O.E. is the British Government department created for waging subversive warfare but that the C-in-C Mid-East is responsible for all operations in that thoatro of war. S.O.E. plans A must therefore conform to C-in-C's operational requirements and to the strategic requirements of the Chiefs of Staff. . Thoy arc therefore submitted to G-in-C for his concurrence and I in carrying them out S.O.E. arc acting ns his agents.  It was remarked that this machinery has boon set up to enable the combined Chiofs of Staff to pool the resources of the United States and Groat Britain and allocate them to the various theatres of war having regard also to transport facilities. It was accordingly agreed that it will therefore be impossible for S.O.E. Mid-East to make direct application to the American S.O. for equipment of this type. It was con sidered however that if the American S.O. can become possessed of aircraft soaernft etc. it might be possible for them to send thorn to thoir own Mission in tho Middle East and place thorn at the disposal of the British S.O.E. organisation. In doing this however it would bo necessary for tho American S.O. to send thoir own crows and spares etc. so that the aircraft could be serviced as an independent unit and it is clear that oven this plan would involve negotiations with the military authorities in Egypt. Nevertheless it was agreed that S.O.E.. London should make up a list of equipment in this category of which they stand in need and supply it to tho American S.O.  Regarding Non-Service equipment it was pointed out that tho British S.O.E. are themselves manufacturing all thoir own special devices and W/T sets. At the same time it was agreed, -7  thnt there v/as n shortage of certain types of W/T sets and broadcasting equipment. Accordingly it v/as agreed that S.O.S London should make up a list of their requirements under this heading and supply it to the American S.O. and it was agreed that so far as this equipment was concerned there could b'e no objection to the American S 0. either  a Despatching it to their American Mission in the Middle East or  b supplying it direct to S.O.E Mid East.  Regarding personnel it was explained that there is believed to bo a shortage of '7/T operators in the Middle East and that it would be useful that if say 10 trained V//T operators could be attached to the American Mission for work in the S.O.E. Mid East War Station near Cairo. It was also pointed out that S.O.E. Mid East to-day recruits the majority of its Greek \and Jugoslav personnel from their respective armies and that it was desirable to obtain nationals of these two countries and of Bulgaria Roumania and Hungary from other quarters. Such personnel should be trained as W/T operators and as export organisers for infiltration into occupied countries where they can assist friendly elements to organise passive resistance sabotage and revolt.  2. WESTERN EUROPE It was agreed that in any attempt to arrive now at arrangements for co-operation in this sphere it was necessary to take into account the distinction between countries likely  to be invaded by the Allied forces and those not likely to be so immediately affected and also to allow for at least two distinct phases in the development of the situation set out below.  On this basis the following detailed agreement was reached.  A. INVASION SPHERE This sphere covers Norway Holland Belgium and Prance.  Arrangements for collaboration would have to go through at least two phases of which only the first could be discussed in detail at the present time. This first phase would bo one in which the British S.O.E would continue very much as it is at present working both on the development and operation of a field force of agents in each of the countries concerned and on the building up of an S.O.E. liaison organisation for attachment to the appropriate Military Commands to accompany them to the Continent whilst the American S.O. concentrated on preparatory work at the same time giving such assistance as they could to the British S.O.E. in its task of operating the field force abroad. This phase would end as soon as the stage was reached when the question arose of an S.O.E liaison organisation attached to an American Command taking over the actual operation of a field force abroad  FIRST PHASE  a Organisation in the Field  It was agreed thnt it was essential that the field force in each of the four countries concerned should continue to be treated as one whole the object being to create throughout the area likely to be invaded by Allied Forces a single, United Notions Fifth Column organisation to he at the disposal of the Allied invading force -whether American or British. This would mean in practice that the American S.O. Mission in England would not with the exception of the case referred to at the end of this paragraph put agents of their own into these countries who would function separately from the existing field force and who would he operated separately hy them from London. If agent personnel were available from American sources it would he treated exactly like agent personnel available from other sources and infiltrated hy the existing headquarter organisation into the appropriate country to work as part of the one existing field force there. In effect during this first phase there would he no change in the character or method of operation of the field force abroad the American S.O. simply contributing such assistance as they could in regard to personnel equipment facilities intelligence etc.. The type of assistance particularly envisaged hy the British S.O.E. representatives was passports air transport and assistance regarding dollar transactions.  The exception referred to above is the case of American representation at Vichy. It was appreciated that as long as the United States retain diplomatic relations with the Vichy Government it was possible for the American S.O. to have an organisation based on their diplomatic mission inside Vichy France and in fact they have made all arrangements to establish such representation. It was further recognised that American S.O. representatives in Vichy would inevitably make contacts and create though perhaps not on a large scale a system of agents. It was agreed that such a field force should not as far as could at present be seen have any direct connection with the normal S.O.E. field force in France. At the same time to avoid confusion it was agreed that  i this Vichy organisation would be operated by the American Mission in London and not by Washington direct and  ii that the S.O. Mission in London would operate in closest collaboration and in accord with the general direction of the British S.O.E. French Region.  b Liaison Organisation  It v/as agreed that the American S.O. Y/ould concentrate primarily upon the recruitment and training of liaison staff v/hich vYOuld eventually be attached to the American Commands in order to provide for the latter S.O. services in the areas in Y/hich they would be operating. It v/as envisaged that the American S.O. v/ould recruit this personnel in the United States give them preliminary training there and then send them to. England for further training. Such recruitment and training v/ould of course be tl e responsibility of the American S.O but the British S.O.E would place all training facilities in England at their disposal. The American S.O. would of course only require to recruit liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands with qualifications for operating in those countries which would be invaded by American forces It was considered probable that a sufficiently definite indication of these countries could be obtained at an early date. As soon as such indication had been given British S.O.E. would cease  to recruit and train liaison personnel for those countries which had been allocated to American Commands.  At least a certain proportion of the American S.O. liaison personnel v/ould have to be given as part of their training an, intimnte knowledge of the field organisation with which they would have eventually to work and this could only he done hy  training them in the country sections concerned at British S.O.E Headquarters.  SECOND PHASE  This phase would commence as indicated above when not only had there been a definite indication between British and American forces but when also the American S.O liaison personnel for attachment to American Commands had been more or less completely organised and the question arose as to whether they ought not to take over the operation of the field force in the areas in which they were going to function. It was agreed that it would be impossible at this stage to lay down arrangements to cover this contingency since so much would depend upon factors which are at present unknown e.g. the actual allocation of the Commands the imminence of the invasion itself etc.  Thus if Norway were allocated to the United States Forces it would be comparatively simple once they had reached the necessary stage of development for the American S.O. liaison organisation attached to the American Command for this area to take over the operation of the field force in Norway absorbing for the purpose as much as was necessary of the country section which had hitherto been running it. On the other hand it would almost certainly 0 impracticable to split up the control of the field organisation in the area comprising the Low Countries and France since not only would the field force in France form a whole which could/not be divided between two separately controlling headquarters'in London but also' the activities of the field force throughout this area once the invasion had started would be of more or less equal importance to all parts of the Allied Line except in the areas immediately behind the actual fighting. For example sabotage activities in the area of Liege of Luxembourg or of Chalons could bo equally useful to British forces fighting in the Low Countries and North-Eastern France or American forces fighting in the region of Rouen or Amiens A good deal will obviously depend upon the form of military command eventually established and it might be found that if the supreme Command headquarters for the whole area were established in England the concentration of the whole S.O. Headquarters with that Command would be the best solution. It was accordingly agreed that the way in which the control of the field force which during the first phase would be concentrated in the British S.O.E. Head quarters should be allocated between the British and American organisations and would have to be worked out gradually as the situation clarified.  B. NON-INVASION SPHERE . This sphere covers such countries ae Germany Italy Switzerland Poland Czechoslovakia and Sweden. The con clusions reached regarding the way in which collaboration should be effected in these areas can conveniently be set out under the three following headings  Poland and Czechoslovakia  In regard to these two countries the secret armies and other underground resistance organisations arc operated by the Governments of the countries concerned so the role of S.O.E. whether British or American Will continue to be essentially that of providing them with all possible assistance. It was, recognised that the British S.O.E. have already Been working for a considernhlctime on the joh of assisting Poles and Czechs and co-ordinating their activities with the strategic policy laid down hy the Chiefs of Staff Committee and that at any rate for some time to come the role of the American Mission would only he that of providing assistance which they could make available more easily than the British.  It was agreed that in order to avoid line-crossing  a all dealings with the Poles and Czechs in regard to S.O.E. activities would he carried out hy the American Mission in London and not hy Washington direct and  h whether as a result of an approach hy the Poles or Czechs or on their own initiative the American S.O. Mission in London would not make any arrangements for the giving of assistance to these Allies without first consulting the British S.O.E. and concerting the a measures proposed with them. â„¢ Germany and Italy  It was agreed that at any rate at the present stage there was no need to insist upon a single S O.E. field force in ticse two countries and that there would prohahly he room for a long time to come for separate British and American organisations working in these areas. At the same time it was recognised as obviously essential if line-crossing were to he avoided that there must he some clearing house for the operations of the two organisations. It was agreed  a as far as American S.O. was concerned Germany and Italy would ho operated hy the S.O.E. Mission in- London. and not hy Washington direct.  b that the American S.-O. Mission and the British S.O.E. Headquarters should work in the strictest collaboration in regard to these two countries keeping each other â„¢ fully advised as to progress and policy and that they should endeavour as far as possible to allocate exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channels available. Sweden and Switzerland  Special problems arise in connection with these two countries since they represent bases from which work can he carried on into several areas.  a Sweden  It was recognised that the American S..0. would wish to establish representation in Stockholm It was pointed out hy the British representatives that their present Mission in. Stockholm was engaged on four separate functions namely work into Norway work into Denmark whore we work for S.-I.S as well as for ourselves and preparations for post-occupational work in Sweden itself and work into Germany. It .was pointed out that whilst with work into  Germany the general principle laid down in paragraph h above could have been easily applied and would have involved no very close connection between the American S..O. represent ative in Stockholm and the British S.O.E. Mission there work into Norway Denmark and Sweden itself was a much more delicate business. As regards Norway it was clear that activities in this country must he governed hy the arrangements, for Invasion Countries set out above in Section A and that it would be impossible for the American S.O. representative in Stockholm to operate any field force in Norway.  As regards the other three countries it was -agreed that he should work in the closest possible collaboration and in accordance with the general direction of. the head of the British S.O.E. Mission in Stockholm.  b Switzerland  Switzerland is a base for work into Germany Italy and Prance It was felt however that unlike Stockholm it would probably be sufficient if it were agreed that any American  S.O. representative in Sv/itzerland should be operated by the American S.O. Mission in London and not by Washington direct and that the. American S.O. Mission in London should in this connection work in the strictest collaboration with the British S.O.E. Headquarters each keeping the other fully advised with regard to progress and policy and that they should endeavour to allocate as far as possible exclusively to one or the other the various contacts and channels available. With London thus being used as a 'clearing house' it was felt that it would not be necessary or perhpas not even advisable for the local representatives in Switzerland to have any connection with each other.  3. NORTH AFRICA AND THE IBERIAN PENINSULAR A North Africa and Gibraltar  The following provisional arrangement was arrived at in regard to this area  i North Africa including Spanish Morocco to be regarded as predominantly an American sphere of influence.  ii The American S.O. to establish the Mission for North Africa the head of which would be responsible for S.O.E. activities in that area. The existing British organisation would continue and its personnel would remain administratively and operationally responsible to a British head but the latter would operate under the general direction and control of the American head of the Mission machinery will be set up to this end.  iii General policy would be agreed between Washington and London and instructions would be issued by Washington to the American Head of the Mission a copy of any such agreed instructions would be sent from London to the head of the British organisation.  iv Gibraltar as an S.O.E. base from which supplies of arms and equipment transport facilities and W/T facilities are made available would remain outside the area of the North African Mission and under the control of the head of the British S.O.E. organisation.  v In order to ensure the closest co-operation and liaison between the Mission and the local British civil and military authorities machinery will be set up which will enable the Governor and C-in-C Gibraltar and the British, -12 -   Gonsul-GGncrnl Tnngier to oxcrciso the neccssory supcrviGion and co-ordination.  B SPAIN AND PORTUGAL  In view of the fact that S.O.E activities in Portugal w  other than the uso of Lisbon as a base for'the creation of lines of communication into Prance have been practically reduced to nothing by the decision of the British Ambassador and the Foreign Office and of the fact that British activities in Spain arc to all intents and purposes directed and controlled by the British Naval Attache in Madrid it was agreed that there was no need to come to a detailed agreement regarding collaboration between the British and American S.O.L.s in this territory in the course of the present discussions. Such collaboration as was possible could be worked out in due course on the spot between the present American S.0. re presentative at Lisbon and Madrid -or by his successor if he were removed -and the local British representatives.    It was indicated by the S.O.E. representatives that it might bo very convenient to have the American S.O. handle the few W/T contacts left to the British S.O.E. in Portugal.  It was made clear that the section operating in Lisbon on linos--of c-ommunieation into France would not be included in any arrangements for collaboration in the Iberian Peninsulr  proper.,  6h' Local nr 95a  CIPHEI TEI-ECRAM.

Copies to Ayftl fi through 1 U Section .1 File 1 Spares 3, , To. D Prom. A.D.4.  I attach an appreciation which the L. Section has done for your approval of the meaning of certain telegrams from New York as to the G.50 000 set-up.  I asked U. if he agreed with the L. interpretation and he replied that he did not. At my re'quest therefore he has done his appreciation .  Both are incomprehensible to me., e fi GFT/2S10. 10th July 1942 I write to confirm our conversation of yesterday on the subject of the agreement recently c me to between us and Colonel Donovan for collaboration between British and American n o. organisation My understanding is that tier were only two joints which you would 1 ke to se amended in the agreement contained In tb Record of our hlscusaions with Colonel Donovan s staff officers na nely   1 DUAuA. You wished duraa to be described as a British aphere of Influence into which the Amorloan S.O would be free to work from China instead of a in the exalting Accord a no-nan s land into which both the British organisation in India and the American organisation in Clilne were free to work.  li You wished it to be explicitly laid down in the Principles that in the allocation of territories us either exclusively or predominantly ritish or American the factor of Military Coraaftada in the area I -b l -principal coi It r 61 on and that the allocation of ter itorles on this basis should bo reviewed from time to time In the light of the development of the military situation. Thus for exam Is if ritish forces were some day to operate in China In circumstances which i ht. anount to this area coning under British .Military Command we should have the right to claim that the present allocation by which China is to be treated a-..-an American sphere of influence should be reviewed in our favour. It was further agreed that the procedure to be adopted in regard to any modification of the existing record of Discussions with Colonel Donovan s staff she id be as follows - . As soon as we had d the corsaents of both the Eld tli Chiefs taff. tn the iiecord we should advlss our Amerloan oolleagues of all the changes which were desired by our people. Colonel Donovan would presumably do the sme after he had received the ccEKaente of the Chi' fa of Staff ani the State Department. At that stage the question would arise of drawing up an amended agreement to bo accepted and signed by oth parties. llxis opportunity would b taken to draft an Agreement in a simpler and ..ore condensed fora that the existingrecord. r. o., In the -meantime w undertook to prepare for you a simplified and consolidated state ant of the conclusion embodied In the hecord of Diseuaalona and thin will be sent to you as soon as .-oselble . Loxley Esq Foreign Office Lon-ion . . .1. A V' I, Al/XX/l  13th July 1942.  TO V p PROM A.D  I refer to L s inemorandiMa L/XX/123 to me attaching an appreciation of the meaning of a series of telegrams from New York on the Psychological Warfare Committee.  This memorandum arrived during my absence on leave and was passed by A/D 4 to the U. Section for their comments the latter did not altogether agree with L's interpretation of the telegrams and produced an alternative chart copy of which is attached hereto .  Doth from the documents in question and from the fact that the U Section had the advantage of frequent conversations with 0.50 000 s officers and G.50 000 himself on the subject of the Psychological Warfare Committee of which G.50 000 was fully aware even though the President s Executive order had not then been issued I am quite satisfied that the U. Section s interpretation is the correct one.  As the position in Washington is now so extremely confused I do not think that it would be advisable for any appreciation of the position to be circulated to other Sections for the time being.  oQO', /xy /-i  Many thanks for your letter GFT/2510 of the 10th July about the agreement between yourselves and Colonel Donovan for collaboration between the British and American 3.0. organisations.  The two points which you mention in the second paragraph of your letter were I think the only two specific changes in the agreement suggested at the last Foreign Office -S.O.E. Meeting. At the same time as Sporborg and I explained to you a good many other ideas and suggestions were ventilated on both sides. Most of the discussion was however either inconclusive or of a preliminary nature due partly no doubt to the fact that it was not entirely easy to study a series of documents in which some of the later papers amended or superseded points agreed in the earlier papers. It was therefore suggested at the end of the meeting that a single document should be prepared for further consideration and that in the drafting of it regard should be had to the various views expressed during this preliminary discussion.  When this new single document is ready it will obviously have to be considered here in detail and then discussed with you at one of our meetings and I should think it is quite likely that further amendments may then be suggested.  I do not suppose there is any misunderstanding between us on this but I think that I ought to make it clear that the points which I mentioned to you at our talk are by no means necessarily final.  Colonel G. F. Taylor. 1/, I imagine that it would probably be useful to discuss at a Foreign Office -3.0.E. meeting the future procedure to be adopted as between yourselves and Colonel Donovan but for what it is worth I agree with you that the procedure which you suggest in the third paragraph of your letter is probably the simplest and best., w /  4378  16th July 1942.  From W/s.  P  For your information Bill Bullitt told Morton  that Psychological Warfare had been removed from control of G.50 000. It was G.50 000 himself who thought that one up and who got the Chiefs of Staff in Washington to sign the order giving him this responsibility. I understand that the first paragraph of the order drafted by G.50 000 himself made G.50 000 solely responsible for defining what Psychological Warfare might Bob Sherwood however managed to get through at the back door at the White House and showed a copy of the order to the President before any damage could be done. The President has signed a blanket order as Commander in Chief of the United States Army and Navy to the effect that any propaganda activity allocated to G.50 000 by the Chiefs of Staff fcros to be cancelled automati cally.  Roger Makins is leaving to-day for West Africa  where he takes post under Swinton expecting to arrive Accra on Tuesday 21st. After some vreek or two there he goes on to Madagascar. Part of his Job there will be to resolve the LushGraffley- Smith problem.  A copy of the first paragraph above has been s ent to U., AD/ifeiC/14. 18th July 1942.  TOs A/r' . Caesar FROM A/D. As you are aware u strong Liaison Mssion has been sent to Washington to work with G.SO.OOO'a organisation. The purpose of this hiasion is both to discuss with 0.50 000 8 organisation any matters of mutual interest throughout the world and also to assist the 0.50 000 organisation in building up and operating its machine in the light of the experience of 8.0.0. over the last two years.  It is obvious that ior the successful performance of these functions the Mission must be kept as fully as possible in the picture regarding the activities of S.O.E. in all areas so as to be in a position intelligently to discuss all problems which may arise. u. Section is respcnslfcle for feeding the Mission wi h the necessary Information and keeping it fully up to date. ror this purpose he .ruot depend largely on what he is told and what is made available to him by other sections and the object of this memorandum is to impress upon all sections tiie necessity for the olcteet cooperation with If. in this matter.  There .ust be no question of holding back information for fear of it being used in the wrong way. In the first place it should be made perfectly clear that the information which If requires is for our Liaison fission in Washington and not for G.50 000 s organisation itself. Secondly if a section wishes to attach conditions to the use of the information this can very easily be done by the mems of a eraorandum which will be passed without alteration to our Mission in Washington. Finally if a section considers ih.ct the information is in its opinion too secret to be conveyed even to our Mission in Washington they should not make the decision on their own but should refer the issue through their Director to me  oOo, LS/ 1/1009 20th July 1942. Ftljl.  TO FROM L/S.  Communication of Information to Officers of the Office ofStrategic Services. The desirability of issuing some rules to guide Sections upon the above matter arose recently and it v/as decided to set up a small Committee to consider the problem. This was while A.D. was on leave and just before the new organisation grouping the Missions under him became effective. Reference was therefore made to AD/iJ. who appointed U. to sit on the Committee. The Committee decided that it was necessary for certain rules to be issued to act as a guide until the position was further clarified and AD/P. has now issued these recommendations in the form of a circular a copy of which I attach dealing with the matter from the Operational Security and Intelligence aspects. I thought it as well to put you in the picture as to how the circular comes to be issued as I do not know whether AD/U. will have thought it necessary to trouble A.D. on the matter and he might wonder what the history was., Uo  MOST SECRET  r - 1-.T r y y-yr 'r' Rt  2.Q. X.j  From AD/P  To All Directors Regional Heads and Section Heads.  Officers of S.O.E are likely to be called upon to an increasing extent to discuss matters with officers of S.O.E. s American counterpart referred to below as O.S.S.  Questions will arise as to the extent to which information may be disclosed to them particularly where the information is obtained from or affects other services.  The following rules are issued as a guide unMl relations between S.O.E. and O.S.S. are further clarified or until a general directive is issued by the J.I.C. when a further circular will if necessary bo issued   l Policy. S.O.E. policy may be fully discussed with the appropriate officers of O.S.S. No reference should however be made to future operations to be carried out by other ser vices save in areas where the U S. forces were likely to be involved or where subversive operations are the primary respons ibility of 0 .S.S. S.O.E. Projects and Operations. These should not be discussed with officers of O.S.S. in detail unless they are being called upon to play an active part.  Intelligence.   a From Most Secret Sources Intelligence obtained from these sources may not bo  communicated without express authority from AD/p. This author  ity will not be granted unless the intelligence affects theatres  in which the O.S.S. has a primary role or where it may affect  some major decision on combined S.O.E./O.S.S. policy. Where  authority to communicat is granted the intelligence will be  passed in a paraphrase form and no mention will be mad'1 of the  sources or method by which it is obtained.     k Other Intelligence. Other intelligence unless excluded by the proviso of paragraph i above may where necessary be passed to officers of O.S.S. This may include information from official summaries except those portions specifically excluded from communication to lower formations c.g. the sidelined portion of the War Office Summary and intelligence from S.O.E telegrams. When it is necessary to communicate intelligence contained in copy numbered OX reports or Foreign Office telegrams the gist of the intelli gence and its degree of reliability should be communicated ver bally but the document itself should not bo referred to.  2, 2   iv Technical Equipment a nd listhods. There ie no objection to showing or explaining exist ing equipment and methods to the appropriate officers of O.S.S. or discussing equipment or methods under development except that equipment and methods-on the most secret list of other departments must not be disclosed.  v Sabotage Handbooks. There is no objection to allowing appropriate officers of O.S.S. to. sec those books.  vi Syllabi cf Instruction and Details of Training. There is no objection to communicating those to offioers f -O.S.'S to the sam extent as to officers of S.O.E i.o details can be oommunicat d to those officers of O.S.S whose duties render-it desirable for them to be so informed .  vii Codes -and Cyphers. Thor is no obj ection to communicating the general linos upon which we work to appropriate officers of O.S.S. Details should not be communicated., KiY/us/ise 24th July 1842  tour ADj/ii3/l577. 1 'mvQ spoken to U regarding th arrange jent8 tidiiohwe should put in force for keeping the  v-.

Dear Loxlej  1 attach hereto copies Sos. 1 2 and 3 of a suBjat&ry in the form of an agreamant of the record of discussions oetween British S.Q.E. and Aaerlean S.O. which took place during Colonel Donovan s visit to London.  As you will see I have provided for the insertion of paragraphs to meet the two points raised by the Foreign Office in the course of our conversations.

' ven thm rather general prinei let nay not be able to be applied strictly In all cases and it may be necessary to make exceptions in certain countries to meet special requirements. XI. It was agreed that the following areas could be allocated in accordance with t x foregoing principles without raising any .very serious problems. 1 hebia  It was agreed that India should be regarded as & British area where all operations would be carried out by the iritish idssion with control being exercised froa tendon. Tiw Mmriemi S.O. would have She right to send out a liaison nission t toe attached tp the British Mission for liaison purposes but not for operational purposes. 2.

The American fission would be established at Chungking and would direct all S.O. activities in this area. It would bo controlled fro Washington. The existing British Mission at Chungking would be reduced and would be turned into a liaison mission attached to the imerican Mission. The British liaison mission in addition to Its liaison duties would render any assistance which it could to the American fission but only at Kti latter s request and under the letter s control. 3.

This area would to considered as covering l ew .'Juinoa and the Islands of the hast Indian archipelago up to and including Java and Borneo. It would be for the American S.O to amice its own arrangements with the I.S.P which already exists in Australia under General MaeArthur & control. Writish 3.O.E. would continue to give any assistance asked for to this Mission. 4 To be inserted at the request of the foreign Office '  BUKMA  It was agreed that Bums should be a British area but  that Auerloan S.O. should have the right to work into it  as convenient from China., 4  5.

The profirsams of these American Missions would be worked out in a much Detail as possible between Washington and London.

A More detailed egreeaeat was ccets to in regard to the following areas which present somwb&t ec lioatod problem . i. BALiiAMs Am tm Mimm eaiv. It was agreed that. In view of the fast that all unitary Co.usaaade in this area were Britieh Sossa&ads that the principsl political authority was ti'i British Minister of State at Cairo and that the whole of the territory other than Turkey -within which and frm which operation could take place r be based -was wholly or partially under British military occupation tlse area at present cowered by the British 'v. with its headquarters at Cairo should be regarded m predominantly a British area. At the mw tine it was appreciated that there were aay waye ia wh ioh the Auerloan 8 0 eeeld be of great assistai in this area. It could call upon resources in regird to equipment materials and possibly personnal which were not available to the British S.O.S. and la certain areas -for exa le Turkey and Iren - American pertooael could ia erne respecie operate more easily than British personnel. It was accordingly agreed that th aot-up should he as follows s-   Si controller of the existing British  C E Klseim would be regarded ae being in charge of all n.o S. operatic in that area and would he responsible for all S J E. activity to the local authorities -particularly Urn 3 0 S.  aub Co ffldtte of the Miniate of ftate s via Council and to headquarters in Tondon. An Ab&ricmi S b Mission should be set up ia Cairo with the object of providing such aselstanoe as It could to the British .3 E. and of contributing to the hritish C.o E. service which would only be available from tius heeriesn side fli forsa and, / iei aYlwn  6  extent of the orgaiiiaetlon of the itoaerloan 'laaioii and ale th& cope ftnd e reoter of It festivities would be discussed end settled by the ]ie d of the Mmvictai lesionwith tii British Controller under whm he would be working.

With regari to such Q&xmmlomtlom between Sasliington and fclio oed of the Smarlomi i'.is ion In Cairo It was agreed that all such telegram -whether origina ting froa Washington or Cairo -should be repeat to the itaaerlcan Mission attached to L.u L lozidan. It was also agreed ta&i It would be the rfeeponaibliity of ti /mmrlotmmission In London to keep British 5.0 1 informed as to the content of 11 such maaa.ges which affect British interests. Xt was agreed that if the Anarlean PiesIon set up their awm war Station in Cairo It would be used only for emuiiieatIons with Washington as tiui war station belonging to 5 0.S hid-Sast i als ady adequate for hundling all 3osatsmications with scents In the field ' The substantial effect of this arraiigaMint would be tiiat there would be a single 1 . aacLino in the area at the head of which would be tbs present Controller but that under him thei-e would be two orgnalsatlo ui mmX the existing British G I organisation covering tlw whole area of the .11 .salon and & snail steer can organisationwhieh would be fitted by the Controller into the gsmral  proiiraisam wherever It could help. in regard to the question of supplies of quiwaentfrom kmrlcm to d C S.

In doing this however It would be necessary for the American S 0 to acod their own crews and spares etc. so that the aircraft could be serviced an Independent unit and it i clear that even this plan would Involve negotiations with the military authorities in Bgypfc. nevertheless it was agreed that S 0.B. London should make up a list of equipment In this category of which they stand in need and supply it to tiie feerlcan L 0  Regarding Sc -S rvi e equipnent it w&a pointed out that the Eritiah 3 o s. arc thaiaaelves manufactwing all their own special vices and Vl/7 sets. At the settle time it w&s agreed that there was a abortage of certain types of /T acts and broadeasting equipment. Accordingly it was agreed that S.i.i'L London should make up a list of their requirements under this heading and supply it to the AswrlUan S 0 f and it was c e d that so far as this equipment w is concerned there could be no objection t the American g. . either  a hespatching it to their American liasion in tlie middle Last or b supplying It direct to S.o.E. Kid Bast. Begarding personnel it was asplained that there Is believed to be a shortage of /T operators in the ii ldle East and that it would be useful that if say 10 trained n/7 operator could be attaohed to the African fission for work in the s.o.E id Last war Station mar Cairo. It was also pointed out that s.l.E LM Last to-day recruits the majority of its Greek and Jugoslav personnel from their respective armies m& that it was desirable to obtain nationals of these two countries &nd of Bulgaria Kouxaaaia and liungas y rroa other quarter . Such personnel should be trained as operators and as expert organissrs for infiltration into occupied countries whore they can assist friendly clesients to organise passive resistance sabotage and revolt.  2. bLSTLhL LUKJfE It was'agreed that in mj attciapt to arrive now at arrangements for co-opsration in this spiicre it was necessary to take into account the distinction between countries likely to be invaded by the Allied forces and those not likely to to so Ismodiately affected and also to allow for at least two distinct phases in the develop ment of the situation as set out below.  on this basis the following detailed agreement was reached.  A. IIIVASiaM SfliLRE This sphere covers Norway. Holland Selgiusa and Frame .  Arrangemats for collaboration would have to go through at least two phases of which only the first could be discussed In detail at the present time. This, flrafc phase weald be om In willoh ttm iJritleh ' . ' h. would continue very rruah as it la at present workl M both on the development and operation of a field foroo of agents in each of the countrie eoncerued and on the building up of an r .0 E liaison organisation for attachment to the appropriate Military Commando to accompany them to the Continent whilst the American  S.o. concentrated on preparatory work at the aa e time giving such assietanee aa they could to the Srltleh S.u.h in it task of operating the field force abroad. la phase would end a aosm as the star was reached when the %ue tlon arose of an 3 0.E. liaison organisation attached to an Anorioaa Cosasand talcing over the actual operation of u field force abroad.  vnm u ornfenisatloii In fell .field It was gr d that it was essential that the field loro in aoh of the four countries concerned should continue to be treated e one whole the object being to create throughout the area likely to be invaded by Allied hare a single United MatIon Fifth Column organisation to be at the disposal of the Allied invading force whether Ansarlean or britlah. Thin would mean in practice that the Amrlcan . fission in -nglaad would not with tins exception of the case referred to at the end. of this paragraph put agents of their own into these b . .nirl e who would function separately fro the existing field force and who would be operated separately by them fro -lendon If agent personnel were available from American sources it would be treated exactly like agent personnel available fro other a. -ureas and Infiltrated by the existing head quarter organisation into the appropriate country to work as part of the on exitting field force there. In effect during this first phase there would be m change in the character or method of operation of the field force abroad the American 3.0 imply contributing such assistance as they could in regard to personnel equipment facilities intelligence etc . The type of assistance particularly envi aa d By the brltleh f -. representative wee passport air transport -and assistance regarding dollar transactions  the exception referred to above is the case of American representation at Vichy. It was appreciated that s long e t ie united State retain diplomatic relation with the Viehy Oovemaent it was possible for the American 8.0. to have an organisation based on their diplomatic mission inside Vichy Prance and in fast they have mad all arrangemonte to eetablleh such representation. It was further recognised that American 3.0. representatives in Vichy would inevitably make contacts ansi create though perhaps not on a large calc a system of agents. It was'agreed that such a field fore should not ae far a could at present be seen have any direct connection with the normal f.O.S. field force in France At the same tin to avoid confusion it wee agreed that  1 this Vichy organisation would be operated by tiie American klsalen in London and not by laahlngton directj and  ii that the S.d. fission in tondoa would operate in closest collaboration and in accord with the general direction of the British s.o.E French Legion., -  b U.ftl qn -Jy -milMat.ion It Agreed th..at the & irieaa S.o. would eoaoontrato prlmtlly upon the r crult5a at end training of liaiaon staff which would eventualiy be attached to the Aimrio&n Co.-ar.aMe in order to provide for the latter . services in the areas In which they would be operating. t was envisagedthat the American &.0 would recruit this personnel in the . United States give ti s preliminary training there m& then send tbesa to ..r land for further training. Gueh reerttitawmt and training would of course he the reeponaibility of the American s.o but the liritieh 3 0 6 would pirn all training facilities in Lngl&nd at their disposal. She American .0. would of course only require to recruit liaison personnel for attaoheamt to American CoTaands with quAlificatio.as for operating In those countries which would be invaded by M&rl&m forces. It was considered probablethat a sufficiently definite indication of these countries could fee obtained at an early date. As soon e. such indication had been given British I 0 S would cease to recruit nd train liaison personnel for those countries which had been allocated to Americaa Coataands At least & certain r .-orfeion of the Jtmrietm S.O. liaison personnel would hum to fee gives as pert of their training an intimate knowledge of the field organisationwith which they would have eventually to -.vork &n& this could only be ia fey training them is the country seetlozte coneoraed at Iritial. f.i.r . j ad uarters. S.SCU31 PSASS Shis phase would eceamenee as indicated above whan not only had there been definite indloation between brltieh and Mmrlmn force but when also the Mmrlcm S.o liatori personnel for attachment to American Camtmx s had been more or less couplet-oly organised and the question arose a to whether they ought not to take over the operation of the field force in the areas In which they were going to function it was agreed that it would be impossiblt at this stage to lay dawn arrangements to cover this ecntlngeney slnee to mmh would depend upon factore which are a.r at preterit ymlmmm Â§ tlis actual allocation of the Ccmiruinds the imlmmtt of' the Invasion Itself etc. Thus If fiorway were allceated fee the United ftafees force it would be c p rAtiV8ly eisple once they liad reached the meaaaary atage of developaent for tbe AHerlaiai s.o. liaiaat organlaation attached to the eserioan demsod for this area to take over the operation of the field force In no w y absorbing for that purpose as auch cm was-neeassary of the  ouatry eeetion whleh had hitherto bean running it. On the other hand it-would almost certainly be leprae15cable to split up the control of the field organisation in the area eoaprlaiAg the Lew fountri-e and ' rwmw since not onlywould the field force is i'ranoe fora a whole which could not fee divided feotwean few. separately confcrolli ig headq-sarterei feondOB but also the activities of the field form throughout this &rm one the invasion had started would be of acre or-loss equal importano to all parts of the Allied line except in the areas lassedlatelj behind the actual fighting for example sabotage activities in the srsa of Lie gw of Luxembourg or of Chalons could be equally  useful to British forces fighting In the Low Countries and POrth Sastem France or American forces fighting in the region of houen or Amiens. A good deal will obviously depend upon the fom of .military soaataad eventually established and It might well be found that If tbs supreme Command, 10  he idquart ers Tor tlie wiiol io were ost&bllth&d In En-lwxd tlas Ji ntrfttion of fcht whole le idqu rt aniwith th&fc Co4-sa S. would Ve the beet solution. It wos ftecordlagly agreed that the way in which the c nfcroi of the field force whlc '. during the -first phase would be concentrated in the a iti Vi D E. Headquarters should be allocated between the British and Aaoricaix organisationsand would have to be to rk d out gradually as the situation clarified. l. Sfn.'.q This sphere severs such eountriee as berasay Italy twlftrliwlj NdrtWl SgeehceltWhta mid wed n. The conclusions reached regarding the way In whieh collaboration sliould be effected in these areas can conveniently be act out under the three follow 1 and djBeehoslovakie In regard to these two countries the secret armies and ether underground resistance organisation arc operatedby the Oovernments of the countries concerned so the rol of S.b.E. tehethsr British r American 111 confelnu to be essentially that of providing them with all possibleaseletsnee. It was rocognised that the British r.i h. have already been wox'.clng/r'xr a considerable time on tli& job of assisting roles and. Gseche and co-ordinating their activities with the strategic policy laid down by the Chiefs of Staff Committee and that at any rate for sesae tine to oceae the role of the AnarIcar. Issiim would onlybe tJxat of providing aesistanoe which they could .aak available saore easily than tbs Dritish. It was agreed that in order to avoid lino-erosslngj a all fisalings with the Poles and Csechs in regard to S.J.3h activities would be carried out by the toarioaa Mlssloa In London and not by fe-ashington  direeti ami b whether as & result of an approach by the -olee or Cseoha or on their own initiative tiw .American S j. Mission In London would not 1-s.ake any arraagesionts for the giving of assistance to these Allies without first consulting the British 8 0 1 and concerting the amiasures proposed with them It was agro l that at any rate at the present stage there was no need to insist upon a single .u E. field fores In these two countries mad that th r would probably be rom for & long time to ooc for separate British and teerican organisations working in these areas. At the a ecu thus It was recognised &a obviously essential if lias-crossing were to b avoided that tlx re must be some clearing house for tbs operation of the two organisations. It was agreed a os far a .mcrlo&a 3.0 was oeneemsd leraiBiy and Italy would be operated by the . ' . x.lsaion in London and not by Washington direct. to that the Jteerican f ..

I could not attempt to put you In the picture by tele gram for the txiro reasons indicated in Ho.2775J firstly the security aspect is being very vigorously stressed in London at the moment and we have been strictly forbidden by our masters to pass on to anybody the various things which we learn in the course of discussions at which we are present. This diffi culty can be I hope partly overcome by the exercise of care in a letter but would have been quite impossible in a telegram secondly the situation is very complex far from clear and changing daily. If I had attempted to summarise it in veiled terms in a telegram I would probably only have succeeded in thoroughly misleading you.  As I told you in Ho.2775 is leaving today by plane and you will have to obtain from him both general information about the operation in question which you will need for under standing the rest of this letter and the answers to the specific enquiries made by you in your Ho.82210.  Dykes oould certainly have given you the general picture and that he has not done so is evidently due to the same security instructions which are sealing my lips even tighter than Mr. Baldwin's.  Assuming that you can find out from X the general back  ground you should know the following, U/US/2l8 5 Sheet I 12/8/42 182. 3107 48146 09095 50812 56103 03914 77848 93103 74595 63129 92966 9677 32016 98979 39299 52068 86001 07256 95219 47203 18580 . 38888 1031S 07602 75735 -74079 06659 59096 76317 84972 75560 45320 13462 59081 26299 80541 58305 97891 01885 55068 12156 42047 46922 43357 64614 34896 29047 05169 11655 41023 58585 37776 79302 07278 49154 03547 21060 75244 94989 55243 56906 97815 86049 . 65212 10746 68513 20583 60466 06704 89403 99631 85494 88725 57057 66931 74061  71189 12956 99894 82577 81461 23561 12229 67208 64690 39572 56905 64964 85397 00546 85970 20041 70054 78106 41395 15031 21837 03382 96086 36487 51188 41167 19535 17719 93824 67466 51871 07168 88930 42581 734.42 33706 82015 77020 45206 40033 . 87425 38589 35082 85401 45646 32742 88640 66120 59254 56033 72599 59897 27941 21006 17333 84237 01462 83689 49815 74051 40655 41403 93188 54408 74008 98951 29035 65048 96320 71S0S 55737 91241 89654 02840, 26720 65134 12429 68250 35505 83113 98489 18949 58850 97810 38843 84504 52295 61364 00465 80641 79251 76243 80558 61332 00806 46308 70955 97643 51447 99848 22939 35069 26559 46719 90490 04533 59275 31093 83642 17480 03027 04444 18340 43804 29411 85325 23065 49090 86347 53352 27253 18764 84189 37597 52675 46384 72353 20974 91821 29830 91371 35939 22067 56321 47205 28640 95935 79395 88963 30892 84386 64742 17310 25543 82653 33205 56986 04809 57886 26806 53047 44683 93930 18151 28690 40490 07128 80685 23932 91249 39312 36164 08309 05012 94551 63437 84120 88615 02578 13309 35472 69334 96969 81309 81368 43128 36809 91312 10437 05290 36997 38342 02147 63178 69778 37091 97232 05320 54618 89365 73166 78016 37025 28031 38018 49448 95051 56912 57569 58603 55669 44425 69836 86122 16667 30758 21006 49795 49620 71355 70793 13498 47187 93887 9146a 33104 03591 78028 48255 77909 66702 70868 81346 17352 75035 21374 14471 13886 46234 \ i \ 90134 83029 98504 99752 39906, 60000 39815 64113 57585 92080 12984 09991 35230 30544 50625 11791 59002 78667 44343 50445 71460 27153 19824 77276 25110 12044 72749 66415 32225 98759 31970 17474 04076 43773 52732 31410 56116 02C22 77204 44720 61955 35818 76544 59747 64190 72562   ' 88568 32518 23767 53412 97044 02898 61951 S2108 06453 41976 359S1 27660 59973 41213 20069 60422 23414 64176 73678 07051 06986 19814 48749 16194 47918 15044 55012 21457 88717 58887 72200 50126 28989 00415 27513 94329 57820 54080 51993 59014 29789 38772 25575 81915 91156 79742 43801 30004 64617 06415 12506 73440 32803 41895 48966 93361 5602S 16361 24101 96555 39625 32369 97631 36307 04375 97543 41052 63051 22255 52082 90155 30058 30816 58551 42372 30722 24693 20316 05271 50125 51230 25282 17462 18673 60831 57341 66707 45863 88756 07198 10365 73432 19282 52125 13246 42621 71772 10149 37343 62197 73991 67575 58970 77892 54901 59065 63727 03234 04873 030 Â§5 09942 26345 77841 87770 17372 816 51 70619 91016 99146 60351 37418 75274 12935 62430, 58625 25066 56699 56897 30241 08760 17580 03595 66161 08748 78994 52910 88000 67443 21906 16422 34363 80266 31625 33399 36467 07786 23129 08594 78612 71522 44103 S35G7 08674 57981 87422 79689 42314 84855 58134 82657 65808 99433 38766 80523 45090 17884 41699 45654 26596 97175 41388 42438 90556 03883 74699 05617 28238 33456 57137 12528 61537 24070 89138 3107 78205 02529 01299 31420 27324 72173 55S56 79224 27474 76013 20962 85026 09105 87676 88235 11973 23037 02534 82018 04285 52344 04637 43737 3C4SS 66053 05820 97885 87709 56242 620 79495 53246 8004C 11168 80208 37977 26299 63498 27865 18315 89274 55587 48160 64901 48398 25776 04395 63904 94030 06614 4490 39709 26559 23205 44442 9176 4 46536 60346 7G643 24934 950 GO 41550 65121 41581 24528 53695 27224 94064 22492 08112 26527 51093 33414 55567 79378 37534 85246 70226 62116 35022 56829 60 697 34798 18531 71886 14692 99296 00318, SECRET.

It was most useful in giving me the necessary background and atmosphere on your side of th water both in New York and In Washington.  The situation as you describe it in New York la on th whole substantially what I expected. The line which G.h. is taking is also what I would have expected and I think he is right.  does not seem at the moment to be anything we can do from here to help except   a bear in mind the absolute necessity of giving CUM. the maximum support and never saying anything which could by any chance give the impression however unintentionally of lack of confidence in him. This has been very carefully noted here and we will act accordingly.  b address all telegrams to G. . . even if they are  for G. This will be a rule in the Missions  J henceforth and I shall do ay best to get G.D. to adopt the some practice.  As regards Washington pleas assure G.M. that wo fully appreciate his position and we quite understand the difficulty of trying to build up his own   relationship with 0.50 000 and that of the Mission generally with G.5O 0QO s organisation if we are continually screaming about breaches of the agreement which are at the most only threatening. I am quite -laaepared-to ceept your view that we should not worry too much about reported intentions on th part of the American 5.O.E. which may be contrary to our interests and to the agreement but which ' G.iU In th last resource would be able to scotch with G.50 000.  At the same time you must not be upset that we should tell you quite frankly and if necessary in rather strong terms our reaction to thee reported intentions. This will not mean that w will expect you necessarily to pass on our views either immediately or with the same strength to the Americans. That is a matter for G.h. s discretion aslong as he gets th result that we want he is the Judge of the means and the tempo which he should adopt. He will constantly be confronted with th problem of balancing th effect of protests by us on his relations with 0 50 000 against the  P.T.O, risks of allowing tlae G.50 000 organisation to oomit tiienselvos In scxas oonsidsrabls degree to a line of action which la contrary to our interests I do not see however -how he can hop to strike this balance unless he gets from u a pretty clear Indication of our reactions to reported teerlcan intentions and the degree of serious-w ness of our opposition to sorao contemplated A-erican action. I hope this is quite clear If you and he do not agree with what 1 say pleas write and tell me so  We are somewhat concerned here regarding both the degree of-internal confusion in 0 50 000 3 organisation and the apparently crippling restrictions which are being imposed upon the 0 3 S by a recent Directive issued to G.50 000 and telegraphed to 0 0 3 by'J 5 K. Washington in J S M. 350 of 12 8 42. 1 entirely share your view that however tiresome the O.S.S may be at present and whatever diffi culties they may cuase by rushing-into natters which they do not underatand it would be wholly contrary to the interests of .O.K. if anything serious were to happen to 0.50 000 or his organisation .g. if they wort wound up or portitlono fc or even hopelessly crippled  is no special news to give you from. Imre -or   to put it the other way there is far too much even to begin to write It. At any rate there have been no disasters lately nor anything to worry me real y seriously.  Please give our very best to G.b and assure him of our absolutely-unlimited confidence. At a recent meeting at the Foreign Office the whole assembled body of Assistant under Secretaries broke out into a song of praise of him  Pleas remember ms to all the other members of the Mission and particularly to the old Master.  1 0    4., U/XX/2222.  To A.D. through AD/U  I sent a copy of that part of the revised version of the Progress Report applicable to 0/00 0 's section to M.G. and a copy of the full report to AD/P asking for authority to despatch to New York.  I have been informed since by M.G. that 0/00 0 has written to 0.0. stating that he does not feel that we are justified in sending any reports of this nature to New York.  f Z/wC T\kinM r . f mj-\, PERSONAL.  ADP/US/18S3 21.8.4S  TO A.D. FROM AD/P.  I send back herewith the condensed Progress Report which 0. sent to me and which I have examined myself and had examined by the security people. I have already expressed rather strong views about the despatch of a report of this nature to G.M. and am most anxious naturally not to appear obstructive but quite frankly I cannot see any object in sending the majority of the revised report in order to interest G.M. and I am prepared to make a case if it is necessary for reference to D/CD A and/or C.D.  I have pencilled lightly those parts which I consider should not be sent though some are naturally on the border line.  I think you said that G.M. would Squire documents of this sort for his own information but the tendency always is I think to pass on interesting snippets whereas surely his functions are not the transmission of snippets but guidance on main lines of any organisation which eventually may be established in U.S.A. Many of the items in the attached paper seem to be merely of gossipy or passing interest and I repeat I think it is a mistake to send them., mss&m 1. m&m  saloli Gcoaittee.

O.S.S will not engage in any activity which has not been approved by the J.C.S. and/or the Theatre Oornnander.

Lt.-Col. Huntingdon -who until now has been Security Officer for the whole ox J.C.S. hes been designated his successor. The latter in an interview with G.M stated that in Ms view Goodfellow had been working upon the wrong lines and had been creating a guerilla organisation rather than an S.O. H Huntingdon intended to start anew completely and with the exception of one man. Commander Vanderbilt would hand all the existing B 0. organisation over to the guerilla side of 0 5.5 Att he same time we are advised that Lt.-Col. Garland Williams who had been in charge of training was leaving the O.S.S. and no successor is designated., As Lomgfcingdon In Ms interview with O.M intimated that the existing training arraiigouent of the 3.0. aide would have to be drastically revised if not scrapped this does not appear to affect the situation a iy aat deal.  In brief the situation ixi regard to 0.3.S. 3.0 branch appears to be that aJ.l existing organisations such as they are will be handed over to the guerilla side . A new chief who has not had my S.O. training takes over .with one assistant of whom our hew York office has always spoken very highly. It' is not clear as to whether any or all of the various American officers who have or are being trained here will remain in the new 3.0. organisation or not. A cable has -teen sent to clarify this  It must 1-fear be assumed that starting again from scratch it will take a considerable time to build up any sort of 3.0. organisation especially as wo know that there never has been even the nucleus of head Office organisation in Washington.  On the erdit side however it can be assumed that It will be much easier for G.L. and the wainingtan liaison party to influence and guide a new organisation as it is being formed and that in the. long run it will be probably to our advantage inasmuch as a prooor .0. will be created controlled by men who think in terras of S.O. work and not in terns of ar led thuggery upon an Empire State building scale.  s, COP 1%  0 60 000 G&GA.1IS ATI OK.  0 T- L Cnfier taa latest dlreotlTO iaaued by the AaBricar.

To C.D. Proa D/GD 0  Copies to S.&nd SH By arrangement with General dansteen 1 took Colonel Guenther to see Mis this morning as apparently the Americans have raised with the Norwegian representatives in the United States the possibility of evacuating a certain number of Norwegian officers from Stockholm in order to embody thorn in tiie Norwegian Nationalist Unit that is being raised In the United tatas.  I took the opportunity of pointing out that the first practical difficulty WAS the question of aircraft %and suggested to Colonel Guenther that he should press'for a certain number of American aircraft to be used on the Stockholm line in addition to our own and the Swedish.  General Hartsteen and rayself questioned Colonel Guenther on the actual use that was to be made of these officers whether they were to bo used as Oonbatanfc Officers or. Inter preters whether they were to retain their Norwegian citizen ship or take on American citizenship or what. General Hansteen agreed with Colonel Guenther that. If any were' suitable for it they could well be used even to ' 0 - ttnct platoons axkl companies. General Hanstee was anxious to know whether Colonel Guenther .foresaw tills Unit supplying men for S.O.U work and whether the Americans Intended to undertake that' type of work generally in Norway. I pointed  .out here that we had a definite agreement with Colonel Donovan and Colonel Goodfellow that no work would be under taken by the Americans In Norway without tt ootiv co-ordinated fully both with us and the Norwegians through the Am-lo- Korweglan Committee so' that there wduld oe no possibilityof confusion and also so that the Norwegiah Gmsttmmt might know exactly what was happening or being -planned for their own country. Colonel Guenther confirmed that this was the erel policy and I suggested that the best means of Implementing it was when the time earns for an American officer to ait on. the Ang1cEorweg1an ommittee. Colonel  .Guenther did point out however that the primary purpose of this Nationalist Unit was to be useu in conjunction with & proper military invasion of Norway. Colonel Guenther and General Hansteen are old friends they were both I .A. s in pre-war days in trie Baltic states so know eachother well. The up-shot of the saectin . was that Colonel Guenther would first press for American partici pation in extending facilities for Stockholm flights officers and sergeants could then be brought over here from Norway and from them would be picked such men as would volunteer and were suitable for embodiment in such a unit. ., Reference cable Ho.OJOl from Cairo Para. H ffe have already asked Hew York to clarify the position of Parker and Gordon our 333 of 2nd July . The answer which came on 10th July in cable 439 was as follows   PARA. A. GORDON IS A F.I.S. MAH AND N0 LONGER RESPONSIBLE TO G.50 000.  PARA. B. PARKER IS BEING TAKEN OVER BY  G.50 000 FOR S.I.S. PURPOSES.  It looks as if both O.W.I. late F.I.S. and the S.I.S. branch of O.S.S. may be indulging in a little S.O. work on their own.

A. SCOPE AW CONTROL OF ACTIVITIES Under the latest directive issued by the American J.0.8. to the O.S.S. its functions and powers have been defined clearly. Generally speaking O.S.S has been put directly under control of the Joint Psychological Warfare Committee J.P.W.C. . G.50 000 is Chairman of this Committee but the M.I. Department of the War Department the D.H.I the Operations Department of the War Department and the Plans Division of the staff of the C.-in-C. are also represented.  In the directive it is stated   a All plans for action by O.S.S. will be submitted to the J.C.S. through the J.P.W.C  b Ho commitments will be made by O.S.S. to Foreign Govern ments or agencies on plans or projects prior to the approval of the J.G.S  c Direct liaison will be maintained with military or other Government agencies involved in the execution of approved plans.  d In theatres of operations or in operational areas of Task forces all officers and agents of O.S.S. will be under the direct control of Theatre or Task Force Commanders. O.S.S. will not engage in any activity which has not been approved by the J.C.S. and/or the Theatre Commander. In theatres of operations therefore all O.S.S. activi ties will be under the control of the Theatre Commander elsewhere all plans must first of all be approved by the  J.P.W.0. and the J.C.S. Presumably G.50 000 as Chairman of the J.P.W.C. can refer a project turned down by J.P.W.C. to the J.C.S. B. REORGANISATION There appears to be in progress a complete reorganisation  of the S.O. branch of O.S.S, -2'  Colonel Goodfellow who was in charge of S.O. has been made a Deputy Director of O.S.S. and has been placed in charge  of all purely military activities of O.S.S. 0.11. interprets this to mean that Goodfellow will in future look after the guerilla commando side of O.S.S. Lt.-Ool. Huntingdon who until now has been Security Officer for the whole of O.S.S. has been designated his successor. The latter in an interview with G.M. stated that in his view Goodfellow had been working upon the wrong lines and had been creating a guerilla organisation gather than an S.O.

Lord C-lenccnnar points out that cardinal factor is that Wellingtons from bomber pool can be used for brief sorties but sorties to Jugoslavia can only be undertaken by Liberators specially adapted so shat they cannot be used for other operations. Consequently A.O. C.-in. G. is not in favour of Americans using their Liberators for sorties to the Balkans. Further more A.O. c.-in-c believes that Americans could only get aircraft as a political stunt and. on strength of our using them for Jugoslavia. He would not therefore look on Colonel Donovan s machines as extra to total number in Middle East but as a deduction from number that would otherwise be available for routine operations. We agree with Lord C-lenconnor s tabgram and suggest that you got Colonel Donovan to telegraph to Captain Robert Lov/ to the effect that he should submit to Lord Gleneonnor s authority until real Head of i 'scion arrives. Furthermore that Captain Robert Low must not repeat not initiate any plans without Lord Glenconncr1s ap roval.  V e also view with some anxiety the suggestion that Americans 'should drop their own personnel to Eihajlovic particularly in view of the Jugoslav Army crMs in Egypt where Mirkovie and other rebel officers are only too likely to play off British and Americans.

B. Colonel Donovan's representatives here have never discussed with us again this agreement and we still await Colonel Donovan's confirmation and ratification which lie promised after submission to A. and State Department. C. he have submitted agreement to our own Chiefs of Staff and to Foreign Office. Foynor have given blessing which is rather vague but which definitely authorises us to go ahead with execution of the agreement. Foreign Office have so far suggested on. two very minor amendments. Firstly description of Burma as British sphere into which 0.3 .S. free to work from China instead of as Ho-Man's land. Secondly more explicit provision that allocation of spheres open to review in light of development of military situation. Foroign Office advise us they have some further minor suggestions to make but we. can safely assume no material change will be proposed. D. 1. S.O.para-military activities in B. have almost been reduced to nothing more due to C opposition than to policy of handing over to Colon-el Donovan. 2.

It may of courso be that there is some secret u derstandin Captain Robert Low and Washington. Hy i ipression is that Capt. Robert Low believes i -trying to get on by getting things done. Hone though he is on his own admission in reality only liaison officer attached to this mission he is initiating plans of his own on strength of information ho learns from us and other sources and Ms contact with General Brereton. He then telegraphs Washington for necessary equipment and personnel. B. Trouble is that though ho appears quite willing to cooperate with us he professes to be ignorant of terns of our agreement with American S.0. and states he Ms had no instructions regarding it. C. He sees no reason therefore why he should not get busy in Greece and Turkey as well'. In t nis regard he tells me ho Ms two assistants one of whom he is now proposing to said to Turkey to investigate and the other to Cyprus. D. I am prepared to regard this as harmless for the present for unless he is playing doublegame or bre ks faith with me he will not do anything without my knowledge and consent. E. It is clear that this state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue and tMt his principals must either appoint him as head of merican Lissim advising him of terms of our agreement and instruct him to negotiate with me or tactfully tell him he should submit to my authority until re&l Head of Mission arrives. This latter would be most preferable. F. It is breach of agreement and unfair on Capt. Robert Lew if his principals encourage him in his projects without giving him necessary status and keeping hli. in ignorance of true position G He also points out that A is soon to come here as Head of U ssion with his own assistants several Arabs fourteen Yugoslavs and ten Greek agents recruited and trained in United States during last three months. This would not seem to tally with out previous information or tMt in your telegram to the effect that ttAB is still preparing his own instractions. E. Finally De Chaetelaine Ms reported B and wGtt are now in Istanbul and seem to be dealing with S.O.E. matters. Capt.

As you agreed with me on the telephone this can best be done by authorising our Liaison Mission in Washington to exchange ratifications with Colonel Donovan s people without raising any amendments at all. The American Joint Chiefs of Staff have approved the London Agreement without amendment and this offers us the chance to get the whole thing signed sealed and delivered before any of Colonel Donovan s people can attempt to wriggle out of it. In our opinion any delay and above all any proposals for amendment on our part which would inevitably give rise to further discussion of the Agreement as a whole would be most dangerous.  The. need for the earliest possible ratification is of course best illustrated by the Middle Eastern position where it is absolutely essential that Colonel Donovan should give clear instructions to his people both in Washington end in the field within the next week or so if independent action by Captain Low in Cairo and the despatch of Hoskin s Mission from Washingtion are to be avoided. I see little chance of such instructions being given unless the London Agreement is ratified and brought into immediate operation.   . Loxley Esq. Foreign.Office., 1st September 1942.  CH/2S43  Further to our exchange of letters -mine of the 6th August and yours of the 9th August our liaison mission in ashington 1ms now been officially advised that the Joint United States Chiefs of Staff have approved the agreement between S.O.E. and O.S.S. negotiated in London during Colonel Donovan1 s recent visit. They have suggested no amendment at all and their only comment Is a recommendation that the more detailed arrangement covering Spain and Portugal forecast in the London agreement should be negotiated as soon as possible.  We are extremely anxious to bring the London agreement into operation as quickly aa possible in order to have a firm hold on the proposed activities of Colonel Donovan s organisation in various parts of the world and it is therefore a matter of urgency that the ratification by our respective Chiefs of Staff should be exchanged at the earliest possible moment.  In authorising our liaison mission in Washington to proceed with this exchange of ratifica tions w should like to give them some formal document from you which they could if they thought necessary hand to O.S.S. in exchange for a similar letter from the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.  I should be most grateful therefore if you could agree to send me a letter more or less in the form of the attached draft which would merely be confirming in a few words the substance of your letter of the 9th August.

I write to confirm my telephone message to you of September 2nd that my Secretary of State agrees that you should ratify your draft agreement with Colonel Donovan without amendment. You know already of two of the points which we here made namely that about Burma and that about the basic principle on which areas should be allocated to yourselves or to the Americans. We should be grateful if you would bear these in mind and put them to the Americans at an appropriate moment. The other two comments which have since been made here are as follows   l The section relating to East Africa describes your mission at Durban as being charged with working into Madagascar and Portuguese East Africa . This description strikes us as somewhat inaccurate since in fact your mission is only authorised to use Portuguese East Africa as a base for work in Madagascar and for watching Axis agents. As East Africa is laid down in the agreement as being a British area and as Colonel Donovan's organisation have no more than the right to attach a liaison mission to your people at Durban there should be no fear of the Americans engaging in any independent activities in Portuguese East Africa. You may however think it wise as and when opportunity offers to dispel any possibility of misunderstanding with the Americans by making it clear to them that the activities of your mission at Durban are in fact circumscribed/ Colonel G.P. Taylor, circumscribed within narrower limits than the v/ording of your agreement with Colonel Donovan would seem to imply.   2 The comment has also been made here that it seems anomalous that the Canaries should fall within Colonel Donovan's sphere of activity when this is still a British military responsibility. On the other hand we regard it as being to our general advantage that the Americans rather than ourselves should be responsible for underground activities in Portuguese and Spanish territory. This is not a view which requires to be communicated tp the Americans but you may like to have it on record and to communicate it to Louis Prank for his own confidential information.  \  l, Ref CD/2864 To DCD/A Copy to PCl A Prom CD a.o0 000 imd G. are expected to arrive on September 8th returning to America on September 11th.

I am happy to be able to advise you that I have received formal confirmation from both ur Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office that they are agreeable to the arrangementreached in June coming into force as a binding agreement on both Ofue with no amendments of any sort.  I understand your authorities have taken up a similar  attitude.  I therefore suggest that by an exchange of lette s such as this one of mine to you and a confirmatory reply from you If you ore in agreement the June agreement should be fomally ratified betxveen us and come into full operation immediately.  The agreement in its original form is not a very con venient one for reference consisting as it does of a record of day-to-day discussions in which the conclusions of one day are sometimes modified by the decisions of the next. I have therefore had my people get out and attach hereto a con solidated version which whilst retaining the exact language of the original eliminates those parts of any discussion  which subsequently modified by further conversations-and if you agree   the A could be accepted by both of us os governing document for  future reference., OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES  UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT 72 Grosvenor Street  LONDON  COPY OF THIS LETTER SENT TO C.D.

We recognise at the same time that G.50 000 s  Mercy Ship project offers good opportunities of establishing more or less permanent representation there with exceptional freedom of movement for the supervisors provided its cover is assured. we feel some misgivings on this score and believe that the first trip should be used to test the cover and should not be marked by any active S.O.S. work in the Islands. In the meantime we would welcome ft.50 0 s agreement to our proceeding with our efforts to put a Neucols representative in St Vincent both to cover the interim period and later on to act as a liaison officer with J.50 GOO s organisation in the Islands when it has established itself. In our view an S.G.S. man on the consular staff at St. Vincent could be of great assistance to the -umericjah project. We are also interested in the American project to cover the coast of P.io de Oro with a Gaboverdian fishing vessel and would like to render any assistance in our power to forward this venture.

[ M . 15 3   j sm.   A 14/8/48. noye ok i kdikg Recent negotiations In America for the provision of dollars for the fBig Scheme have shown that it is time w con sidered in greater detail what form 3.0 B co-operation with 0.3.3. should take in the support of the underground action in Poland and Czechoslovakia. 2. It is clear that we must adopt no dog in the manger attitude since there is ranch that the Americans have to offer both in the political and the material sphere. On the other hand any ill-considered intervention by the Americans at this juncture especially if it were not co-ordinated with our own efforts might easily prejudice the smooth working of the organisation which is at present in existence for amintaining liaison with these Secret Amies. There is another point j both Poles and Czechs are well aware that by making their own terras with the Americans they should be able to play 3.0.E. off against 0 3.3. thereby securing a double measure of everything. This is a pastime in which all Slav nations excel and in our view this unnecessary complication can only be avoided provided S.0.1 and. 0.8.3 consider all requests jointly and present an United Front. 3. The help which we want from the Americans is primarily material notably the provision of dollars and long range aircraft. Indeed a preliminary study of the plan put forward by the Poles to the Chiefs of Staff Committee for the re-occupation of Poland makes it clear that the material for cm operation on the scale envisaged must come mainly from American sources.  ' ' '' 4. In addition we cannot ignore the psychological factor. At a time when the countries in occupied Europe have almost given up hope of liberation. It would in our view be of immense tonic value for then to know that the Americans are interesting them selves directly in the underground war which they continue to carry on against the Germans and we would even go so far as to recomend that at least on of the Despatching Officers should be an American so that our abiturendi should see an American uniform just before their departure. 5. We therefore propose that the Americans should be invited to participate as much as they like in the training of our present students and particularly 3n the preparation of plans for the ultimate re-occupation of Poland and Czechoslovakia For our part we wish for the present to keep the actual liaison operations under our ovai control since we do not feel that at the moment the Americans are qualified to take this on but we are quite prepared to initiate them in due course. 6. As soon as the Americans can nominate who in their organisation will be responsible for Polish and Czech affairs. It is important that an emissary from our side should visit the TJ.E.A. and carry out the necessary negotiations 7. In conolxiaion I would add that we consider this matter  to be urgent and that unless we take up a positive attitude to this question in the very near future the Poles and Czechs will male separate approaches to the Americana on their own terms., ot r   LU.I I 'B DCDO/1304. 5th .September 1942 TO C.D.

Hydro-electric power station. TvamSoxmv station and hook Gates Shis is one of the largest iixstallations of its kind in Europe and is known to everybody in France Gemaany and Switzerland. It is just in Alsace which has now been officially incorporated in the Reich and its destruction would seriously affect Gertsen industry and in particular German transportation. She target is fairly isolated and is only about 10 kilometres from the Swiss frontier. There Is ample wooded cover mar it and the population is likely to be friendly. A large part of the electrical output of the station is fed Into Germany and the locks control the whole of the traffic up the Rhine into -iv'itzex land and their destruction would prevent this traffic particularly in the dry season. The attackers should have a reasonable chance of escape across the frontier. M3P.m M g   a Tim group consists of KRAESN I Mine KHABEN II Min  with one concentration plant FJoTIAHD Power Station and SKJERKA Power Station lying in an area approKiraately 50 Kiiles N.W. of KSISTIAHSAM S. The area is reached by a single road which runs from PIEKKEFJOKD about 40 miles distant. The mines are situated is an isolated mountainous region above the tree line  b The mines represent Germany e chief source of molybdenum. The Germans -Krupps are doing their utmost to increase the output to the fullest extent and it is estimated that the planned output of 1 500 tons may be readied in October 1942 This entails the mining and refining of some 1 000 000 tons of crude ore M.E.W consider that KNABEN is the most outstanding objective in Norway from the economic point of view. The Norwegian Government agrees with this estimate  e There is no practical prospect of the party being able to withdraw to the sea. The chances of escape into Sweden would be small. In accordance with the existing policy of attacking all fora of transportation w have considered the possibility of a raid on a large marshalling yard. Eueh a raid would be nothing like so -spectacular but skilful propaganda should succeed in emphasising its great importance. The target suggested is tli yard at GT PIERRE BB8GGRFS to the J.E. of TOURS which lies within 25 kilometres of the debarkation line and therefore offers a reasonable prospect of escape to the attackers. This yard is of the double fig 8 type with a hump and control tower in the centre. There is also a large locomotive running shed which should fora the principal target. The line is electrified and it is known that recent air raid damage took eight days to repair owing to a shortage of Insulators and electrical parts.. Furthermore the shortage of steam locomotives caused a complete stoppage of traffic until the electrical system could be repaired., r-r- T3  me- i ' .UJ u  o' iHJ sen II J/IT/3472. 5th September 1942 TO D/CD Q .

The school can be if necessary split into two parts but must be under unified control 8 lva.r Station Abroad As the Overseas areas will I understand be either under one or otter control the War Stations will fall into the same divisions 4 It is considered that on main line station alone should operate in this country to co-nunic&te with all the war stations 'mentioned in 3 above except that the communi cations with lew York will be carried by the existing link operated through Cf 5 American 11 0Q in England should appoint a C.G.O. forthwith so that no delay my be experienced In carrying out decisions arrived at 6 The extent to which G 60 000 can assist us in equipping min line and war stations should be ascertained both as regards equipment and personnel., u/xx/2305. 8.9.42. To AD/P. From U. At A.D. s request I enclose copy of the summarised Progress Report for the month ending 2nd September 1942 so far as the Missions are concerned. Will you please signify your approval of this prior to transmission to America., 3.O.E. PROGRjSBS REPOR1 Month-ending 2nd September 194E BALM8 & Ryj3lAll 3E0TI0I  YUGOSLAVIA  Good wireless contact has been maintained during the month. Numerous messages have been received and passed which show that A/H.31 has further strengthened his hold over MONTENEGRO SANJAK and SOUTH SERBIA and he has arranged successfully five reception areas. He has informed us that he is ready to receive material and train bodies with the specific object of attacking the BELGRADE-NISH Railway.  Plans are being made to drop numerous food parcels and leaflets over BELGRADE on the night of the King s birthday and during the month considerable numbers of leaflets have been dropped in various parts of Yugoslavia.  BULGARIA  It appears that certain Bulgarian guerillas are co operating with A/H.31 and that these guerillas are believed to be active in the area south of Sofia.  Bulgarian leaflets were dropped over SOFIA PLEYDIN and SQKALYAN during the month.  ABBMIA  We axe attempting to obtain contact by courier with MUHARREM BEJRAKTAR who we are Informed by A/H.31 is believed to be operating south of TETEVO.  GREECE  Wireless communication still continues extremely difficult and the only station operating has been working on reduced power and is very cautious., -2   fe have learned that one of our agents has been invited by the Russians to go to ISTANBUL and contact the Soviet authorities there  Colonel ZERVAO has approached us asking for a f/T Set for direct communications and although he is known to be untrust worthy in money matters he is reported to have a large and Influential following.  It has been agreed that Oomraander ZASGAS should establish an independent Greek service for escapees intelligence and sabotage  osm.  The situation in Crete has become obscure and our only remaining contact during the past fortnight is via O8 channels.  HgOMMIA .  a/H 25 arrived in ISTANBUL and gave a full report on the political situation. This shows that tension is developing between the Roumanian and German Governments due to increased economic demands and to the unsympathetic view of Roumania taken by the German Government in the Hungarian/Roumanian disputes.  A/H.25 returned to Istanbul at the end of the month.  The Turkish YP in BUCHAREST who is a friend of MYRON brought a message to Istanbul from MYRON that he would endeavour to leave by plane for ALEPPO in the middle of August but no news has been received of his arrival. Presumably the arrangements miscarried.  BERNE reports that the Chilean YB in BUCHAREST who is in Geneva stated that two Roumanians had arrived in Switzerland to contact the British with the consent of ANT0NE3CU. At the same time LISBON reports that a Roumanian Secret Service agent had arrived bringing instructions to Roumanian YP to pass a mes sage to the British that ANT0NE80U considers MYRON most valuable to Roumania and therefore guarantees his liberty even if the, 3  Germans should ask for reprisals against him. It is thought that both events may be an attempt to find out how interested we are in MfHOH.  mm.  Our cover in Istanbul has been changed from A.I.A. Shipping 1 to Shipping Department of British Embassy'1. Further W/T Sets have been sent to Turkey.  mm  There are reasonable suspicions that the Military Governors of ISFAHAI and of FiSHEIDAH who are both pro-German may have instigated the ambush which resulted in the death of our agent D/M.14 at the hands of brigand tribesmen near DGRUD.  A post-occupational courier service is being organised along the PERSIAM GULF.  IRAft  A detailed plan fox raising guerillas in northern Iraq using six British Kurdish-speaking officers lias been worked out. This has been approved by the 0.0 10th Army and the British Minister.  Courier services to PERSIA SYRIA and other points are being laid on and plans have been made for the Installation before the end of the year of a W/T war station and a main line  station at BASRA.  miA \Ij  In addition to the post-occupational sabotage organisation mentioned previously a Greek Levant network of cells through the LEVANT is being laid on. It will have Its own f/T and courier   t services.  CYPRUS  Plans as approved by the Governor and Military commander for Cyprus have reached us. They provide for the development of, a caique base to be used as a halfway house for siauggling into GHEKOS and a post-occupational network of celle for sabotage and propaganda. It is possible in the event of enexay occupation  that some Commandos will be left behind and these will be under  the command of our Field Commander.  In addition to the post-occupational organisation mentioned previouslyi CAIRO are considering the possibility of forming an Arab post-occupational organisation.  A pos toccupational courier service operating from EGYPT has been laid on already.  EGYPT In addition to the post-occupational organ cation mentioned already the Greek-Levant network will have cells in Egypt. The existing subversive propaganda organisation is being adapted to continue after occupation and hand presses are being Installed  -QJSM41CA  Our agent behind the enemy lines was withdrawn in the middle of August.  AMOhO-ECrYPTlAh StJDAlf CAIRO is being pressed to go ahead with the establishment  of an organisation at KHARTOUM with W/T and stores as an emergency  base for communications and possible operations in the event of  EGYPT or even ABYSSI.IIA being occupied by the enemy.  A plan is being made also for the installation before the  end of the year of a W/T war station and a main line station at  KHARTOUM. In the event of enemy occupation these stations will  be withdrawn to NAIROBI.

O., OBIHA  A report 1ms been received frcsa an agmut who visited r 7Ajra m0WAll French leased territory and MACAO Portuguese colony in South China where he contacted some possible and likely agents and obtained considerable information on local  conditions and on conditions at HOUGKOIIG. At 1IA0A0 he gave the British Consul a new code and introduced another in case the first  -  should be oozapromised. A constant flow of intelligence has thus been assured and the Consulate at MACAO lias been put into direct touch with the Embassy at CHtUIGICIMG.  The Chinese at CHGIIGMI-TC maintain their ready acceptance of gifts but continue their passive resistance to any active steps suggested by either British ox Americans. The latter are not making appreciable headway and have had some rebuffs. We have succeeded in consolidating our influence in the Chinese Resources Information Bureau whose workm are now subsidising. That the work is proceeding along definite S.O.E. lines and that the Chinese are not inactive in their own interests is proved by the Charter of the Bureau s Field Organisation which is charged with the establishment of a network of activity in HOFiTH CIUIIA NORTH M01TG0LIA MANCHURIA KOREA FORMOSA and JAPAN MOPM. Apart from establishing wireless intelligence and counter-espionage systems the Charter provides for the provision of lines1 into and out of Japanese-controlled territory the establishment of close connections with puppet 1 civil and military officials \ mercenary Japanese individuals and all Japanese revolutionary and anti-war organisations the location of enemy military and indus trial plants and drains for raiding purposes the collection of codes secret documents maps banknotes equipment books   \ circulars etc. etc.  Our two principal agents connected with the Bureau are t making successive visits to INDIA to establish liaison at MW DELHI, anti to ke j our Indian H.Q. informed of the extent of Chinese undergrouiid activities.

As a result of the discussion on Wednesday evening the 16-th instant I have reached the following conclusions as to the way in which the scheme for developing S.O.E. activities in South America in conjxmction v/ith a security plan for that area should now he handled.  1  The original plan put up to Duff Cooper for activities in South America envisaged not merely a limited security scheme for   the protection of certain vital British raw materials and transport facilities hut the extention of training and preparation to virtually all British interests in South America and the development of a British Conimunities scheme in this area. Furthermore the leading role in this programme was definitely Intended to he allotted to S.O.B. who in addition to heing responsible for training in their Canadian school would supply the very considerable staffneeded in South America and would in conjunction with the security Co-ordination pl ectorate in London undertake the work of contacting British interests and  generally dealing with the administration at tixis end. Finally . it was proposed that G.M. should actually direct sad maiiage the whole programme at the American end under the largely nominal authority of sir Canop Guthrie.  e In view of the reaction of Mr Duff Cooper to this scheme  when put to him it was agreed by all that it must be at least temporarily dropped and that S.O.E. must retire into the back ground in regard to the Security Scheme for South America and must not give any appearance of wishing to get control of It or to develop and exploit it for its own purposes.  We thus return to the original position position in which G in hia capacity as Director of Security Co-ordination in Mew York has been asked by the Security Co-ordination Authorities in London and by the Chiefs of Staff to undertake at once a, Security Scheme in South America for the protection of certain vital British interests there and to call for this purpose for such assistance from S.O.K. and S.I.8. as he may think necessary and desirable. As far as 3.0.I. is concerned I am naturally entirely agreeable that the S.O.B. Organisation both in the Americas and in London should provide any assistance required and G. will advise Duff Cooper of this when he seas him this morning the 17th instant.  As regards the American end the position will be that G. In his capacity as Director of Security Co-ordination will have e Charter to go ahead with the South American security Scheme.  .... . likewise have a Charter to 50 ahead with the development of their Organisation in South America subject only to certain limitations imposed by the Foreign Office in regard to the carrying out of actual operations and '. under 0. s general control is responsible for carrying out these functions. I fully agree that in his Joint capacity G. should integrate the   Security and 3.0. and if he wishes the d.I.U. Plans for South America and I also agree that as from its nature S.Q.K. Is much the most suitable Organisation for developing an Integratedscheme on these lines he should in the main use  S.o.B. staff and 3.O.B. facilities for.this purpose. It is recognised that ae the immediate occasion for the development of the South American scheme ie the security requirerwnts indicated to G. by Mr. Duff Cooper and the Chiefs of atafi Sir Canop Guthrie as the head of the Security side of G. s   Organisation should at least nominally take the lead in the execution of the Plan. I am quite agreeable however that in practice G.M. and his staff should do the real work either directly add when necessary with the knowledge and approval of Sir C. Guthrie or acting nominally on Sir C. Guthrie s behalf.  milst me cannot say at the moment how far it will be possible by this method to achieve the full programs originally put to Duff Cooper and outlined in Para. 1 above it seaas to, me likely that a very great deal can be done without raising would be any of the difficulties which x /breught to the for by persistence with' the scheme in its previous form. Should the 'Foreign Office decide to eetqp a Department to deal with the development of Xl Britie i aQtn mmity org Tiotrtion in rhmth  merica it would b neceseaiy for 3.0. . to tie in their work in this matter with the Foreign Office Department in the same way m it is now proposed to integrate the Beeurity and 0 0.K. Schemes. In the meantime 3.O.K.' con proceed with its prep arations for Jiritish Gcmmunlty Organisation as part of the joint security/a.o. . scheme. As regards the London end it would soem unwise unduly to pres a.0.services upon Duff Cooper and hlploek. Our asoistance will bo offered to them by O. at this morning s meeting and the possibility of using our machinery can. bo tactfully drawn to their attention froi time to time in future  as the opportunity preafrits itself by Al /0. As the Security Co-ordination Directorate in London is not itself organised to carry out the sort of work which will be ssauired at tlie London end for the execution of the South American sch ae and . as 1 understand Duff Cooper is not anxious to expand his Organisation it wo Id seem almost inevitable that they should eventually tum to us for help.  The above prograntno raises inevitably questions of Personnel  and Finance oh which 1 think i should ley down the procedure which I wish to see followed '  a  When it was envisaged that 8.0.15. would openly and with the full agreement of other parties concerned-take over responsibility for the Punning of the whole South American scheme it would have been entirely in order for G.M. in the course of his visit here to have made arrangements for the taking on of the staff required.  Under the revised scheme however as set out above it, k  G.M. It seems to me that it will be necessary for G./and Sir  C. Guthrie to work out carefully which ports of the integrated scheme would he curried out by 3.0. . Personnel and which parts hy security personnel and thus to determine how far the very aonsiderohle new staff rectuired should he taken on as .0.E. staff or security staff. /hen this has ail been worked out 0. should send hack hie proposals in detail so that I may authorise the S.o.a. staff increase as required and so that v/e here may collect such staff as should he sup lied from London. The interviews which G.M. apd AD/U have already held during the last -week will of course he useful for this purpose. b TIMHCS  The same principle ahould.be applied with regard to Q finance. G. with his' two managers ana-nir G. Guthrie shbuld work out what financial requirements should he home by 3.O.S. and what hy Security. Although the fundamental idea is that the scheme should he a single integrated on and that therefore its budget should he worked out as a whole it may for obvious reasons hav to have the appearance of being two schemes one tj.O. . and the other Security each with its own budget Mp own view-is that it will he an advantage for the   .u. side of the budget to be os large a proportion of the whole as possible for the reason that control of the puree ten to give control of operations The main item in the runAing cost of the Scheme will. tKidouhtedly h the cost of training which is estimated at approximately 1 200 dollars per head This should clearly appear on the 3.O.B. side of the budget  G. will accordingly produce a budget In the foiga that seems best to him and send it to London so that I may approve the G.O.G. contribution . f v . .  London. september 1942., TO C.D FROM VD Copy to A/DUj G M. Oaesur.  Tii Summary of Agreement between the British S.O.K. and Ataerican l-.O. 3.B . stated that there was no need to come to detailed agreement regarding collaboration of British and American orgfe isations in Spain and Portugal during the discusslonc of June 1942.  The American Joint Chiefs of Staff however in confirming to G.50 OOO their agreement of the arrangements made during the course of the June discussions urged that the agreement should be completed by early negotiations of en arrangement covering Spain and Portugal.  The following is therefore put forward as a basis of discussions with G.50 0GG.  C 5u OOo should appoint an officer with Service or Commercial cover preferably the latter in Lisbon who would also be accredited to i adrid so that he could visit that capital with diplomatic facilities. This officer would be regarded as the head of a Joint Anglo-Amerlean .0. organisation in Jortugal and our representative in Lisbon H.A would as far as hia work in Portugal is concerned   as distinct 3rrom work done in Lisbon for other sections operate under the direction and control of the American Head  of Mission.  The London Agreement of June 1942 expressly provides that a section operating in Lisbon on lines of coromunicatl n into Prance would not be included In any arrangements for collaboration in the Iberian Peninsular proper.  As regards Spain the American Lead in Lisbon when he visited Spain would undertake to act under the control of Y.L. and not to take any intitiativ'e without the latter s knowledge and approval.  We would inform .50 000 that apart from the above arrangements wo have sent an officer from headquartere on an exploratory tom in Portugal with a view to disvoering what economic action could usefully be taken by 5 0.T. e iher of a subversive kind on Its own behalf or on behalf of other depart ents of ii.h G. Any such action would be directed from London would have no connectIon wit' or be In any way under the j rltish S.O.F . representative In Lisbon and would not be considered as ebing covered by this Agreement. -o, , G. is c.ll out to win the Vfcr and G.M. hopes that G will re tain his post.  b t '.Washington there are DH/Y G.M.llO G.H.350 and G 11.1501 together with G.M.300 all working in h's offices.

He is liaison both for S.Ol and  S.'I. purposes and has two of Gfs S.I. men working under him.  c Relations with Y.P.9' Admiral Cunningham and F.B.I arc all good  The hew York office is nor/ satisfactory although about 12 men have been eliminated either for return to England or transfer to S.I. or transfer to Canada Relations between S.C. and S.I. are good All S.O.'telegrams pass through G.M. personally and all ..S.I. telegrams pass through G 6. ADMII'ISTRATIOITX Questioned by D/CD a G.M. said.that he proposed that BEhSOh should act as general assistant to G.M. particularly on administration finance and supplies. It was agreed that be fore leaving London he should get familiar with the work of all the Departments concerned. .. 4 7. SECURITYi  a G.M had tightened up matters and a proper system of office passes was now working . All personnel are duly sworn â„¢ in D/CD- a pointed out that retiring personnel must also be sworn out. G.M. and AD/U confirmed that all men who had left G's office and. re turndd to England had bfen s. worn out and their office passes had been withdrawn. r'  b Sc curity is the responsibility of S I G.M did not think that he ncedfed'r special S.O security officer. The security of all S.O. Missions is under G ' ''' i.1' .'  c Sir Connop Guthrie is in charge of security for all British Missions in North and South America. British security generally is bad owing to under payment of staff as compared with the cost of living which not only gets officials into debt but causes constant change of secretarial staff. 8.

C.D. tiicn rr.isGd following points for discussions  l Binr.ncir.l rosponsidilitys-G.K. said that he was not able to cope personally with the financial side hitherto'. he did not propose to investigate the past history hut generally speaking he was satisfied that nothing-was fundamentally wrong Then EBITSO joined him all financial matters would be subject to the sanction of him and G-.K. D/fin .emphasised the need for separating our-S.O. budgets from S.I. budgets G-.M. said that separate accounts were'..kept although both Organisations in New York were housed in the same building. Then 3ENS0N arrived he should ta-kc-full charge -of finance administration and supply which would ensure -proper separation from 8.1   2 0-ntrol of S.T.S. 105s-G M. pointed out that he had recent instructions that S.T.S. 103 was to be taken out of his province and handled .exclusively by D/CD 0 the main reason being that D/CD c objected to' his training personnel being interfered with by G/T from New York. He pointed out that G/T was. now leaving . It was .agreed that G.h. and D/Yin should discuss this matter. C.D ruled that subject to discussion with D/CD 0 on his return the intention was that while D/CD 0 should have exclusive charge af training at S.T.S. 103 financial administration should be done from Hew York It-would therefore have to be considered whether to reverse the recent decision to put into the -hands of D/CD 0 the administration as well as-the training arrangements for S.T.S 103 since the basis of that decision had been altered' by the retirement of G/T. D/CD a said that the only aTtcr eative s wcrc s    a Financial administration under G.'M or  b Financial administration from London through a local representative of D/Fin in Hew York -and that the-second alternative was probably not practicable.   5 SouthAv-mricanremittrnccss-D/Finand G.lvl.areto discuss this question.   4 Supplies -G.M. said th.c. position was unsatisfactory there were numerous contradictions in telegrams from London requests were -received in Hew York from several different See L.ions i O' was impossible lor G lo. personally to goondina.to the supply.problem there were important security aspects since many of our requests at present passed through the hands of the British Purchasing Commission. At thd New York end he pro poses to recruit a local man to work under BENSON exclusively on supplies. AD/U said that from'the L-hdon 'end. he was at present only a post-box for communications' on supply matters from E and other Sections and could not co-ordinate it himself This problem led to -discussion of a wider issue as follows  5 Heirtion between London and-Bchf York -C.D. said that Herds of Missions co-ord water and direct the work of Missions abroad. The responsibility for providing Foreign Missions ..ith supplies normally rests with London. G.H. pointed  out that his mission ..had two 'distinct functionss    a to deal with AD/U s territory Americas -and Far East as the Hew Y rk-rc-presentativcs-of AD/U .  b to ensure co-ordination with American 3.O.E. on all matters in all parts of the world acting in this respdet as the Hew York representatives of S.O.E. as a. whole He mentioned as an example, 's  -4   that he received direct requests from Cairo for supplies but it was agreed by all that direct  action by Cairo was v/rong in principle . -G-.J I. end  AD/U were to discuss this matter further and it  appeared from the discussion that it was necessac J  to consider a major change in the set-up at both  cndsi namely - a one officer in London and one in  hew York to deal solely with the v/ork of AD/U s  present territory. b another officer both in  London arid in New York to deal solely with the co-ordiriation of S.Q.E. and O.S.S   6 Poland  a Polish dollars -Agreed that G.M. and D/Pin should discuss this question of providing Polish dollars for the Poles which was essentially an obligation of the Treasury.  b C.D. said that it was possible that the Poles and the Czechs might try to negotiate with Q . independently of their arrangements with S.O.E and suggested that it might be a&visebl to have one of Q/s officers in London as liaison with IL.X. G.M. said it might be more important to have a representative e f M.X. in New York to be in touch with any proposals in co-operati on there between Q and the Poles and Czechs. Such a representativj could also look after the interests of D/R and S. aswell as MX C.D. emphasised that he would be under G.M's orders. The name cf MO/B was suggested as suitable.  Q/s Suicide Squad -C.D. said he would discuss this matter with Q on arrival.   8 Bag facilities to J.Q -The present position having been explained G.M. said it was worse than useless to ask Q . to approach the State Department on any matter relating to bags since in fact the State Department invariably opened all Bs bags. It was decided that no progress could be made on these lines.  8 Communications Signals and vif/Ti a G.M-. to dLscuss Signals with M/S.  b Regarding T-K communications D/CD a and AD/P to confer regarding the prospects of getting and installing T-K J apparatus and to get confirmation of its security.  c A war station for Western Europe to be discussed betwee.n C.D. and Q .  d W/T training of American operators to be considered by G.M. and M/S who should report to C.D. in time for discussion with Q .  e Main Lind Station -M/S and AD/Y to produce estimate urgently for Treasury purposes   9 Other Missions j/tj.M. to discuss with A.D. and AD/U questions regarding Cape Verde Islands Portugal Spain and Middle East.  10 S.O.E & O.S.S -A.D. and G.M . to settle suitable letters to be exchanged between C.D. and Q . recording ratification., ADP/US/1974 9th September 1 942 To DCD. A From AD/P. I am still not happy about this summary. thought it was agreed that a telegraphic periodical summary w as the ideal method and that the idea of a detailed summary was abandoned. I cannot believe that named agents and persons should be s ent in a document of this sort which may be useful qua its interest to G.M s mission but cannot and should not be a matter of interest in its detailed form to all the Americans. The proposal I would like to see adopted is for a fortnightly cable giving broad details of progress or set backs mentioning no names methods or detailed plans and prepared in such a way that G.M. can say to the Americans we are developing our organization in so and so have succeeded in opening new lines of communication have established contact with a new groupand so on.

Thank you for your note attached to the draft circular to he issued by C.D with regard to information for G.IJ.'e Mission. This is a distinct improvement and as I understand it the monthly report will be drafted for me by the various Section Heads. With regard to the weekly telegram can it be laid down clearly what exactly this is to contain i.e. if the Section Heads state that they have nothing for the cable does my responsibility cease and am I to take only what Section Heads give me for trans mission j  Also I should like it perfectly clear whether symbols are to be used and whether operations are to be reported or whether the material to be transmitted is purely that affecting general policy.  I am going away for three days leave and will be back on ilonday and provided the circular has been issued by C/D by that time I will approach Section Heads next week in order to inaugurate the weekly cable., , To.

Admiral Godfrey is going to the U.S.A. on the 21st September and has conveyed through D/Navy an offer to do anything for us in the U.S.A that is possible for him to undertake.

October To -ALL DIRECTORS and REGIONAL HEADS S SN. J. Erom -G.D DIRECTIVE PROGRESS REPORTS FOR G.M. TO SHOW TO O.S.S These Reports if they are to be of any value to G.M or O.S.S. must cover in a general way the following points  1 A general summary of the sabotage effected in each particular country provided that no mention is made of the place or district in which any individual act occurred  2 There might be special exceptions to this Proviso it. There is then ho harm in telling O.S.S at the proper time that it was an S.O.E. job.  3 We should give a general summary of progress made in delivering materials e.g. 4 successful sorties and the dropping of 12 containers but of course without indicating the district or the number of men dropped  4 We should indicate in very general terms the progress of our Organisation in occupied countries but without dis closing any particulars which could point to its identity or location.  5 We should mention progress in subversive propaganda  e.g. Distribution to German troops in the Balkans and any points of interest on the morale in any country and the development of German C.E  6 We should mention our relations with exiled allied Governments and interesting high lights on the progress made in training'students of various nationalities in this country or overseas  7 Generally we are aiming at producing a report which shows the part which S.O.E is playing in organising resistance in occupied countries and any general political social or economic survey should be of a specialised nature and should not include news which can be obtained in a better and fuller form from other sources. Our Progress Report must be treated as a report of one specialised organisation for the benefit of another. While we should record our failures which may be a warning for the future we should bear in mind that our first object is to produce a document to keep our own representatives up to date so as to give O.S.S. good educational information and sufficient data about ourown operations to help them and us to get what we want from the American Authorities., ]
