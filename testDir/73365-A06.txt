NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(а)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(б)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c) COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(a)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(b)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

DIE WO CHEN POST
Vein Dachau uacn
Mauthausen und Haunstetten
Von einem ehemaligen Insassen der Konzentralionslager Dachau, Mauthausen
und Haunstetten erhalten ivir den folgenden Bericht, der insbesondere durch die
konkreten Angaben und die genaue Namensnennung von dokumentarischer Be-
deutung ist.
V\TAR leh der Memung, dass das Konzen-
' ’ trationslager Dachau an Geraeinheit und
Brutalitat gegeniiber den Gefangenen wohl
nicht mehr zu uberbieten ist, so wurde icn
und mit mir meine Kameraden, 1 600 Mann,
welche am 27.9.1939 von Dachau nach dem
Konzentrationslager Mauthausen uberfuhrt
wurden, doi't eines besseren belehrt. Der dor-
tige Kommandant und seme SS-Leute stellen
die Horden eines Tchingis Khan im grauen
Mittelalter wohl weit in den Schatten. Ver-
nichtungslager Mauthausen, so war der
offizielle Name.
Fassungsvermogen:	Mit der Cbernahme
der Steinbriiche der Gemeindeverwaltung
Wien durch die SS-Gemeinschaft ..Deutsche
Erd- und Steinwerke A.G., Berlin, RSHA, im
August 1938 begann zugleich der Bau des
K.L. Mauthausen, welches Lager von der SS
selbst obigen Namen bekam.
Es besteht aus: 20 Haftlingsbaracken zu
zwei Wohn- und Schlafraumen mit ie 43
Doppelbetten, das sind 166 Mann pro Block
Oder 3 200 Mann Normalstarke. Durch-
sehnittsziffer Oktober 1939 bis Februar 1943
6 000 Haftlinge. Nationen: Oesterreicher,
Deutsche, Tscheehen, Polen, Jugoslawen.
Russen, Franzosen, Belgier, Hollander und
Spamer.	^

Der Vernichtungsbetrieb
Das K.L. Mauthausen hat den ihm von der
SS verliehenen Namen Vernichtungs-
laget Mordhausen mit Recht ge-
tragen. AHe Arten des vorsatzlichen be-
stialischen Mordes waren an der Tagesord-
nung. Die Opfer der Mordgier der SS-Leute.
anders kann man dies nicht nennen, wurden
erschlagen. mit den Stiefeln zu Tode ge-
treten, die Felsen des Stembruchs hinunter-
gestossen oder mit Schlagen gezwungen,
f r e i w i 1 1 i g hinunterzuspringen (die
SS nannte diese Opfer FallschVrm-
springer von Mauthausen). Beinahe
taglie-h um 21 LIhr oder etwas spater er-
schienen SS-.Blockfuhrer in den Baracken
und trieben einige von uns mit Stockbieben,
Fusstritten und ahnliehen anderen Mitteln in
den Elektroraum an der Nordseite des
Lagers. Besonders hervorgetan haben sich
hier die SS Leute Muller, Tord, Kor-
sitczki, Nippgen und Hase-
wend, diese und W e i s s e waren auch
die gefiirchtesten Schlager, wenn die be-
riichtigten 25 Stockhiebe ausgeteilt wurden.
Die in den Monaten Juni und Jul't naeh
Mordhausen gekommenen hollandischen
Judeh, ungefahr 1000 bis 1200 Mann starben
. restlos den Elektro- und Feteensturztod.
Nach und mit ihnen hunderte von Oester-
reichern, Tschechen, Polen, Jugoslawen und
Russen. Die tagliehe Verlustziffer Fels-
sturz betrug ca 50 bis 60, Elektroraum 10
bis 15. Im Winter 1939/40 starben t a g -
1 i c h an Hunger, Erfrieren, Seuchen, wie
Dysenterie, Typhus etc. 250 bis 300 Mann,
viele verfielen dem Wahnsinn, viele flohen
in den Selbstmord. Von den 1600 Mann, mit
welchen ich aus Dachau am 27.9.39 nach
Mauthausen gekommen war, lebten am
1.3.40, also nach 5 Monaten Mauthausen, mir
noch 52! Mitte Oktober 1939 begannen die
Ersohiessungen. In den 6 Wochen bis An-
fang Dezember 39 wurden bereits 544 Mann
ersehossen, durchweg Polen. Darunter ein
Mann aus Warschau, dessen Namen ist mir
leider entfallen, welcher neben mir im
Revier lag, schwere BeinopePation, er wurde
mit der Tragbahre auf die Richtstatte ge-
schlep.pt und dann erschossen. Dieser Platz
lag direkt neben unserer Revierbarackg, und
wir konnten alles durch das Fenster beo-
bachten. Diesen Polen folgten im Laufe der
nachsten Monate und Jahre viele andere
tausend Angehorige aller Nationen Europas.
Eine andere Methods war def Mord im
G a s k e 1 1 e r und G a s w a g e n . Der
Gaskeller ist ein kleiner Raum (Zelle) in der
neuen Haftlingsrevierbaraeke. Fassungs-
raum ungefahr 25 Personen. Es wurden nur
Neuankommling unter der VorspiegMlung.
sie gingen ins Bad, hier ermordet; '.inter
ihnen viele Frauen.
Der G a s w a g e n ist ein zu diesem
Zweck umgebauter Lastkraftwagen. Die
Gaszelle fasst ca. 12-15 Personen. Zwischen
den K.L. Mauthausen und Gusen war ein
regelrechter Pendelverkehr eingeriehtei Der
Wagen ubernahm in Mauthausen die leben-
dige Fracht und lieferte im Krematorium
Gusen die Toten ab, nun wiedevholte sieh das
Drama in umgekehrter Richtung. Tiiglich
wurden ungefahr 6-8 Fahrten gemacht. Den
Gaswagen fiihrte der Lagerkommandant SS-
Obersturmbannfuhrer Franz Z i e r e i s
immer selbst. So oft er mit seiner Fracht
an seiner Villa in der SS-Siedlung Maut-
hausen voruberkam, hielt ei’ an. Da eilte
seine Gattin Franziska Ziereis
aus dem Hause, sprang aufs Trittbretc des
Wagens und beobachtete durch das Tdeine
Guckloch (Spion) den Todeskampf der
Opfer. Mit hochrotem Gesichte stieg sie
jedesmal vom Wagen herunter und erklarte
des bfteren laut, dass der Anbliek der sich
in ihren Todesqualen windenden Men/chen
ihr schonster sei. Nicht unerwahnt darf
bleiben, dass ihr Gatte Franz Ziereis sich
selbst riihmte, dass nur auf seine person-
hebe Bitte bin der SS-Reichsfuhrer Heinrich
Himmler die Todesurteile gbgen die zwei
Fiuchtlinge vom 9.12.39 und die seeks vom
Mai 1942 unterschrieb. Alle wurden offent-
lich gehangt. Bei dem einen vom Ma; 1942,
einen Bayern aus Rosenheim, riss der
Strick dreimal ab, erst beim vierten Male
erstickte er unter den furchterlie^sten
Qualen. Der verhaltnismassig „ humariste ”
Massenmorder des K.Z. Mauthausen ist SS-
Sturmbannfiihrer Dr. Krebs bac her,
von uns Dr. ,, Spitzbacher ” geheissen.
Mittels Bezininjektionen hat er viele hun-
derte von Gefangenen in ein besseres Jen-
seits befordert. Er ist der Intimus seines
Kommandeurs Ziereis.
Ein weit in das Land hinein sichtbarei
Zeuge und Anklager fur die von den SS-
Verbrechern begangenen tausende von Mor-
den ist der Kamin des Krematoriums. Meter-
hoch schlagen Wochen hindurch ununter-
brochen Tag und Nacht die Flammen aus ihm
und erfiillt der Geruch von verbranntem
Menschenfleiseb und Knochen die Gegend
ringsum. Wenn es uberhaupt noch notwendig
ist, hier einen Beweis zu liefern, dann ist
die Todesziffer der schlagendste Beweis
hierfur: mit dem 11. Februar 1943 war die
Zahl 36 784 erreicht.
Ich will noch erwahnen. dass mit dem 1.
Oktober 1941 erstmalig fur ganz Deutsch-
land in den K. L. Mauthausen und Gusen
mit weiblichen Haftlingen belegte Bordelle
errichtet wurden. Fur Mauthausen waren
es 10 Frauen. Diese armen Opfer der SS
rekrutierten sich restlos aus den Reihen
jener, deren Vater, Sohne oder Briider als
politische Haftlinge in Konzentrationslagern
inhaftiert waren. Dies nur angefiihrt, um
das Kulturniveau des Dritten Reiches auf-
zuzeigen.
Am 12. Februar 1943 kam ich mit einem
Transport von 300 Mann (116 aus dem K. L.
Mauthausen und 184 aus dem K. L. Gusen)
nach dem Arbeitslager Haunstetten
Augsburg. Wir trafen hier schon 150 Mann
vor, welche einen Tag vor unserem Kommen
aus dem K. L. Flossenburg
gekommen waren. Dieses Lager trug nach
aussen hin die Bezeichnung „ Arbeitslager ”,
ist jedoch in.Wirklichkeit ein reines K. Z.
und untersteht in jeder Hinsicht dem K. L.
Dachau III K. Es ist dies die Abteilung, der
alle Aussenkommanden (Arbeitslager) unter-
stellt sind. Der jeweilige Lagerkommandant,
der jeweilige Schutzhaftlagerfuhrer, der
jeweilige Leiter der Politischen Abteilung des
K. L. Dachau sind die Funktionare aucb
dieser Arbeitslager. Schutzhaftlagerfuhrer
vom K. L. Dachau SS-Hauptsturmfiihrer von
R e d w i t z war 1943/44 auch der
Schutzhaftlagerfuhrer von Haunstetten, sein
Stellvertreter, mit dem Wohnsitz in Haun-
stetten, SS-Hauptseharfiihrer Wilhelm,
ein Tischler aus Munchen. Die Gefangenen
von Haunstetten waren restlos als Arbeiter
oder als Angestellte in den Messer-
s e h m i t t-Werken A. G. eingesetzt. Ich
selbst war vom 1.3.1943 bis 14.11.43 in der
Lohnverrechnung (den Hallen 4b, 4a, ^	4
Zuschneiderei) beschaftigt. Wir

Ende Mai 38 bis Mitte Feurua
neue Gefangene durch das K. L.
durchgegangen.	'r
Konzentrationslager Schwabmiinchen siidwestlich von Augsburg. Hier wurden beim
Herannahen von Truppen der 12. amerikanischen Panzer- Division 4 000 jiidtsche
Insassen in ihren Hiitten von den Wachmannschaften verbrannt oder zusammen-
geschossen, als sie aus den brennenden Gebaudcn zu entkommen suchten. Das Bild wurde
sofort nach Besetzung am 28. April 1945 aufgenommen.
Konzentrationslager
Erschiittert und betreten sind wir aus der
Kulturschau, die dp>* Lager 18 veraustaltete
hinausgegangen. Hier lernten wir durcb
Bilddokumente und Augenzeugenberichte die
deutschen Konzentrationslager kennen! Das
hat das deutsche Volk in seiner grossen Mehr-
heit nicht gewusst! Von meiner Familie war
ein als Kommunist bekannter Onkel in ein
schlesisehes K.Z. gekoimmen. Nach seiner
Entlassung ist nie ein Wort iiber die Vor-
kommnisse in dem Lager fiber seine Lippen
gekommen, auch auf dringendes Befragen
nicht. Er musste einige Zeit danach in eine
Hedl- und Pflegeanstalt gebracht werden, vfo
er auch gestorben ist. Nie bat er gewagt,
etwas zu erzahlen. Auch von Bekannten. mit
denen ich beim Militar zusammentraf. und die
in einem K.Z. gewesen waren, hatte ich nie
etwas fiber ihre Erfahrungen gehort. Jetzt
wissen wir ja, warum: die furchtbare
Drohung, die mit dem Verbot des Erzahlens
fur die Entlassenen verbunden war. versie-
gelte ihnen den Mund.
Die Masse des Volkes, selbst unter dem
Einfluss von Terror und Angst, kannte die
Tatsachen nicht. Deshalb muss ich mich
dagegen verwahren, dass die Verantwortung
ffir diese Taten das deutsche Volk in seiner
Gesamthe'it treffen soli, und dieses in Bausch
und Bogen ffir schuldig erklart wird. Man
ziehe d i e zur Reehenschaft, die die Schuld
trifft, man ziehe den Kreis weit genug, aber
man schone die Masse, die davon nichts
wusste und auch nicht handeln konnte.
Gewiss, die Kulturschau brachte Aufrufe
von Feldmarschall P a u 1 u s usw. die
besagen, dass man sich in Deutschland gegen
das Regime wenden solle. Leicht gesagt von
draussen! Warum haben diese
Verfasser solcher Aufrufe
nichts gegen das sinnlose
Blutvergiessen im Kriege
unternommen, als sie noch
selbst an ffihrender St e lie
s a s s e n ? Sie konnten es nicht—ihnen
war ihr Hals offenbar ebenso lieb wie anderen
Leuten. Wer von uns hatte es tun mogen?
Er ware ein toter Mann gewesen—wir kennen
ja die Falle aus der letzten Zeit, wie es denen
gegangen ist, die in den Stadten zur
Schonung der Bevolkerung zur Kapitulation
rieten.
Wagten es nicht die ffihrenden Personlich-
keiten der Wehrmacht, solange sie im Macht-
bereich des Terrors waren—wie konnten es
die einfachen Soldaten wagen? Ein Beispiel
ffir viele fiber den Terror, mit dem selbst in
der intimsten privaten Sphare personliche
Meinungsfreiheit unterdruckt wurde: In
meiner Einheit schrieb ein Landser erregt an
seine Frau, dass sein Kind die Geburtstagevon
Hitler und Konsorten in der Sehule nicht zu
lernen brauche. Die Gestapo hatte den Brief
kontrolliert und schickte eine Abschrift an
die Einheit. Der Einheitsffihrer reichte
wegen „ Zersetzung der Wehrkraft ” Tatbe-
richt zu einem Kriegsgerichtsverfahren ein.
Wenn eine solche private Ausserung zwischen
Mann und Frau schon als Staatsverbrechen
verfolgt wurde, wie konnte der kleine Mann,
wie konnten die breiten Massen des Volkes
sich zu mehr auf raff en? Kann man unter
solchen Umstanden ein ganzes Volk verant-
wortlich machen, well es die Terrorketten
solcher Regierung nicht gebrochen hat?
Kann sich der unter der Guillotine Liegende
aus eigener Kraft noch gegen das Fallbeil
wehren?—Wie kann sich ein Volk gegen eine
Regiierung stellen, deren Terror dauernd wie
das Fallbeil fiber seinem Haupte sehwebte?
Warum sollten ritterliche Gegner und Be-
sieger ein ganzes Volk ffir die Schandtaten
verwerflieher Kreaturen strafen? Schuldig
konnen nur die sein, die die Verantwortung
tragen und die dieses Treiben unterstfitzten.

Stabs-Ob. Gefr. Willi Ortwein
Augenzeuge aus Dachau und Debica
Als die ersten Berichte fiber die Zustande in
den Konzentrationslagern durch die Presseins
Lager gelangten, gab es auch in unserem
Lager eine lebhafte Diskussion und erregte
Debatten, denn einige der Kameraden konn-
ten sich fiberhaupt nicht vorstellen, dass diese
Schilderungen der Wahrheit entsprechen.
Dies veranlasst mich, hier wiederzugeben,
was ich mit eigenen Augen gesehen habe:
Im Jahre 1943 wurde ich auf Befehl meines
Kompagnieffihrers vier Wochen zur Er-
holung naeh Mfinchen - Dachau geschickt.
Wahrend nieines Erholungsurlaubes er-
krankte ich und musste mich in arztliche Be-
handlung begeben. Das Lazarett befand sich
im Konzentrationslager Dachau; hier hatte
ich Zeit und Gelegenheit, mich mit einigen
Mannern und Insassen zu unterhalten, sowie
einige Sachen mit eigenen Augen zu sehen.
Was ich horte und sah, war einfach unbe-
schreiblich. ein menschliches Gehirn kann
dies gar nieht alles fassen! Die Lager-
insassen mussten mit den - primitivsten
Mitteln Arbeiten verrichten, die grosste
Kraftanstrengung erforderten und dies alles
bei gering'ster Verpflegung und Schlagen.
Die tagliehe Ration bestand in der Frfihe aus
einer dfinnen Scheibe Brot mit Margarine be-
strichen, mittags aus einer dfinnen Brotsuppe
und abends wieder aus einer Scheibe Brot.
Ffir die geringsten Vergehen wurde die
Todesstrafe angeordnet. Auch sah und horte
ich, dass Waehmannschaften, die das Los
der Insassen lindern wollten, mit Konzentra-
tionslager bestraft wurden, in besonderen
Fallen mit Todesstrafe, auf Befehl des
Reichsffihrers SS. So wurden Tag ffir Tag
Menschen hingesehlachtet oder verhungerten
infolge der knappen Verpflegung.
Nur durch diese brutale Gewalt war es
moglich, dass sich das Nazi-Regime so lange
an der Macht halten konnte. Dies alles
mussten Menschen mit ansehen, ohne dass
sie etwas dagegen machen konnten. Tag fur
Tag wurden unsehuldige Menschen einge-
sperrt. Dies alles nur wegen einer Gesin-
nung, die den Nazi-Ffihrern nicht passte,
oder weil sie einer anderen Rasse oder an-
deren Nation angehorten, dies alles im so-
genannten „ freien ” Deutschland!
Ich war froh, als ich vollstandig genesen
war und die Statte des Grauens verlassen
konnte, Leider musste ich alles noch einmal
mitmachen und zwar in einem noch grosseren
Masstab' als in Dachau. Ich wurde als
Ausbilder nach dem Rekruti-ndepot Debica
kommandiert, demselben war auch ein Kon-
zentrationslager augeschlossen. Was ich hier
mit eigenen Augen sah, war so grauenhaft,
dass sich meine Feder dagegen straubt, so
etwas niederzuschreiben. Hier gab es taglieh
soviel Tote und Hingerichtete, dass man dazu
eigens ein' Kommando bilden musste, das die
Leichen mit Muldenkipnernzu den
Verbrennungstatten fahren musste! Auch
hier niussten klar und vernfinftig denkende
Menschen dies alles mit ansehen, ohne dass
sie etwas dagegen machen konnten. Im
Gegenteil: ffir das kleinste Vergehen drohte
ihnen dasselbe Sehicksal!
Mein Berieht soil kein Propagandaartikel
sein, sondern soil den Kameraden, die noch
nicht zur Erkenntnis gekommen sind. die
Augen darfiber offnen, welche Greueltaten
unter deni Nazi-Regime verbrochen wurden.
Kameraden, glapbt mir dies alles. es sind
Tatsachen, die nicht zu verwischen sind und
helft mit an der Wiedergutmachung der be-
gangenen Verbrechen!

Reduzierung der Rationen in England
Der britische Ernahrungsminister
L 1 e w e I 1 i n gab Dienstag bekannt, dass
die Regierung eine Herabsetzung ver-
schiedener Rationen vornimmt. Diese Herab-
setzung jetzt nach Ende des europaischen
Krieges wUrde notwendig angesichts der
grossen Notlage in dem kriegszerstorten
Europa. Zur Feststellung der Lebensmittel-
lage in der ganzen Welt batten die britische,
die amerikanische und die kanadische Regie-
rung eine Untersuchung angestellt, die das
Ergebnis hatte, dass angesichts der agrar-
wirtschaftlichen Lage in weiten Gebieten
Europas, die auch noch nicht entfernt wieder
im laufenden Ernahrungsjahr normale Pro-
duktionsmengen erreichen konnen, mit einer
allgemeinen Lebensmittelknappheit zu rech-
nen 1st. Grossbritannien wir'd zur Behebung
dieser Gefahren durch eine Einschrankung
der Rationen beitragen; diese bestehen in
einer Senkung der wbehentlichen Fett- und
Speckmengen, ferner durch Einbeziehung
einiger bisher frei erhaltlichen Lebensmittel
und Erhohung der Punktabgaben fur andere.
Auch die Geltungsdauer der laufenden
K 1 e i d e r k a r t e ist um einen Monat ver-
langert worden. Die im Verlauf dieses
Krieges gestoppte Versorgung der Privat-
autobesitzer mit B e n z i n — soweit es sich
nicht um Ausnahmekategorien wie Aerzte
ete.handelte—wird in sehr beschranktem Um-
fange am 1. Juni wieder aufgenommen.
30 000 amerikanische Beheifsheime erreichen
England
Der erste Schub Beheifsheime—30 000
Hauser—kam vor wenigen Tagen aus Amerika
in England an und wurde in Lastwagen an
die Baustellen herangebracht. Im nachsten
Monat werden regulare Sendungen beginnen,
die man im Friihjahr 1946 beendigen zu
konnen hofft. Das Behelfsheim ist ein ein-
stockiges Gebaude, hat zwei Zimmer und ein
Badezimmer; alle Raume sind so eingerichtet,
dass sie moglichst viel Tageslicht empfangen.
In der Kiiche befindet sich ein Heisswasser-
speicher und ein moderner Gasherd, der
Wascheshrank hat eine Helzrohre. Es gibt
sieben verschiedene Typen Beheifsheime, die
alle in handwerklicher Arbeit—ohne die Hilfe
von Maschinen — zusammengesetzt werden
konnen.
Die amerikanischen Verluste im Kriege
Wie Kriegsminister Stimson in Washing-
ton bekanntgab, betragen die amerikanischen
Verluste im europaischen Krieg rund 800 000
Mann; davon warden 150 000 getotet. Etwa
80 000 amerikanische Kriegsgefangene wur-
den aus deutschen Lagern ruckgefuhrt.
Der Luftkrieg gegen Deutschland
Der Kommandierende General der ameri-
kanischen 8. Luftwaffe Generalleutnant
James Doolittle gab vor einigen
Tagen zusammenfassenden tlberblick iiber
die Tatigkeit der 8. Luftwaffe gegen
Deutschland. Er sagte u.a., dass in 995
Tagen des Luftkrieges 4 377 785 Spreng-
und 27 556 978 Brandbomben auf Deutsch-
land gefallen seien. 15 439 deutsche Flug-
zeuge warden in der Luft und 3 073 am
Boden vernichtet. 4 660 Lokomotiven, 4 882
Fahrzeuge und 1 449 Tank-Wagen wurden
zerstort. Die 8. Luftwaffe verier bei diesen
Operationen 43	772 Piloten. ,, In 1944 ”
sagte Generaileutnant Doolittle ,, hatte die
amerikanische Luftwaffe nach der Invasion
des Kontinents ihre grosste Krise durchzu-
machen. Anfanglich waren .unsere Verluste
so gross, dass der Erfolg in Frage gestellt
schien. Aber die Flugzeuigproduktion in
Amerika hatte solche Fortschritte gemacht,
dass wir laufend eine grosse Anzahl Lang-
streckenflugzeuge nachgesandt erhielten,
durch die wie unsere Verluste wettmacben
konnten. Durch die standige Bombardierung
der deutschen Flugzeugfabriken wurden
mindstens 5 000 feindliche Flieger verhin-
dert, aktiv an den westlichen Landfronten
eiinzugreifen.
Der Postverkehr im besetzten Deutschland
Die britische Militarregierung hat die
totale Vernichtung und Einstampfung aller
deutschen Postwertzeichen und Versiche-
rungsmarken angeordnet, die Bilder pro-
minenter Nationalsozialisten zeigen, Kriegs-
parolen und -Zeichnungen enthalten und eine
Verherrliehung des Krieges ini allgemeinen
darstellen. Anstatt dessen werden Militar-
marken die in USA gedruekt werden, einge-
fflhrt. Die' wichtigsten Postdienststellen, die
die Auszahlung von Alters- und Invaliden-
,.-n und Steuern und Abgaben
neh, wurden wieder eroffnet.
sche Zivilbevolkerung besteht
i	ustverkehr, doch wurde zwischen
den .on _en alliierten Behorden eingesetzten
deutschen Beamten nahegelegener Landbe-
ziirke ein Kurier- Dienst eingerichtet, der
unter alliierter Bewachung steht. Ein Post-
karten System mit bereits vorgedruckten
Satzen wurde fur verschleppte Personen aus
Belgien, Holland und Frankreich eingeftihrt
und wird in Kiirze auch fur Tschechoslowaken
und Polen zur Verfugung stehen. Russen
werden von sowjetischen Verbindungs-
offizieren betreut.
Frankreichs Zukunft
Mit der Befreiung des letzten Stiicks fran-
zosischen Bodens von deutschen Truppen—
den Atiantik-Stiitzpunkten—ist die Frage der
wirtscliaftlichen und militarischen Zukunft
Frankrei'chs in den Vordergrund geriickt.
Man rechnet damit,—schreibt der Pariser
Korrespondent der Times — dass es ein
stehendes Heer von etwa emer Million Mann
aufrechterhalten wird; erstens, um das Mog-
lichste zur Erringung des Sieges im Fernen
Osten beizutragen, dann aber auch, um ge-
nilgend Besatzungstruppen fur Deutschland
bereitzustellen, da angenommen wird, dass
nach der Abziehung anderer alliierter Trup-
pen in Deutschland Frankreich zeitweise die
Besetzung dadurch freigewordener Gebiete zu
iibernehmen haben wird. Der franzosische
Informationsminister sagte in einer kurzlich
gehaltenen Rede, dass es zehn Jahre dauern
konnte, bis Frankreich sem wirtschaftliches
Gleichgewicht wiedergewinnen wurde.
Kriegsblinde als Stenographer!
Wie eine schweizerische Fachschrift mel-
det, hat man in Deutschland Versuche unter-
nommen, um Kriegsblinde die Aufnahme von
Stenogrammen und deren Ubertragung auf
die Maschine zu lehren; die Ausbildung
dauert etwa 1| Jahre. Die Blinden steno-
graphieren nicht in Hefte sondern auf lange
weiche auf einer Spule aufgewickelte Ban-
der. Zu der Arbeit ! rauchen sie emen
besonderen Tisch, der so eingerichtet ist, dass
sie mit den Fingern das Geschriebene ab-
tasten konnen. Die Schreibmaschine tragt
besondere Zeichen fur den Zeilenabstand und
die Zwischenraume der Worter. Einige
Stenographen brachten es bei Priifungen auf
120 Silben in der Minute, wahrend es
., Rekordler ” auf 200 brachten.
Tod eines Nobelpreistragers
Im 64. Altersjahre starb in Miinchen der
Professor fur organische Chemie an der
Technischen Hochschule, Geh. Regierungsrat
Dr. phil. u. med. Hans Fischer. Dr.
Fischer, der in Hochst geboren war, hat von
1916-21 in Innsbruck und Wien, sonst immer
in Miinchen gewirkt. Seine Arbeiten galten
vor allem der Erforschung der Blutfarb-
stoffe; mit der synthetischen Darstellung des
Hamins ist ihm ein entscheidender Fort-
schritt gelungen; im Jahre 1930 wurde e.r
dafiir mit dem Nobelpreis fur Chemie aus-
gezeichmet.
Liste der Kriegsverbrecher
Die polnische Regierung in London hat
eine Erklarung abgegeben, in der mitgeteilt
wird, dass die Liste der Kriegsverbrecher, die
sie aufstellt, bereits uber 15 000 Namen um-
fasst, nicht nur Mitglieder der N.S.D.A.P.,
deutsche Beamte und Vertreter der Wehr-
macht, sondern auch die von Arzten und Pro-
fes-soren, die verbrecherische, unmenschliche
Experimente an Polen in Gefangnissen und
Konzentrationslagern durchfiihrten; ferner
von Richtern, die liber gestohlenes polniscbes
Eigentum verfiigten, von Kommandanten und
dem Personal von Gefangnissen und Konzen-
trationslager usw. An der Spitze der Liste
steht Hans Frank, weiland Generalgou-
verneur mit alien seinen Beamten. Auch
Himmler, Goring, Darre, Frick, Funck und
Keitel stehen auf dieser Liste.
In Kurze
Die Sowjetunion und Finland
haben jetzt ein Abkommen abgeschlossen,
demzufolge Russland Getreide, Salz und
Tabak naeh Finnland exportieren und Finn-
land dafiir Holzblooke, Papier und Zellulose
an Russland liefern wird.

Vor wenigen Tagen warden die
schwedischen Hafen zum ersten Mai wieder
dem Wethandel geoffnet; vier schwedische
Schiffe verliessen den Gothenburger
Hafen. um nach Lissabon, Mexiko. Buenos
Aires und Philadelphia zu fahren.

Der Chef der Gestapo in Norwegen,
Fehlis, erschoss sich, nachdem er von dem
deutschen Oberbefehlsihaber nach Befreiung
des Landes den Befehl erhalten hatte, seine
Waffen abzuliefern. Sein Stab von 74 Mann
wurde den Norwegern ausgeliefert.
Huizingas Verm'achtnis
YOR wenigen Wochen ist der beruhmte
niederlandische Kulturphilosoph Johan
H u i z i n g a in der Stadt Leyden
gestorben, an deren Universitat er als Pro-
fessor gewirkt hat. Wir haben das Schaffen
dieses Gelehrten als Historiker und Kritiker
der Kultur bereits in einem Nekrologe ge-
wiirdigt. (No. 25.) Heute sei die Aufmerk-
samkeit auf drei seiner neueren Werke
gelenkt, die in deutscher Sprache erschienen
sind. Es entspricht den freundschaftlichen
Beziehungen, die zwischen dem Quellgebiet
und dem Miindungslande des Rhems,
zwischen der Schweiz und den Niederlanden
bestehen, dass alle drei Bucher in der vor-
trefflichen Ubertragung des Baseler Profes-
sors Werner Kagi, in einem Schweizer Ver-
lage erschienen sind.
„Im Bann der Geschichte ”1)
ist eme Sammlung von sieben gewichtigen
Essays betitelt. die sich mit den Probiemen
der historischen Wissenschaft beschaftigen.
Fiir diesen berufenen Betrachter bedeutet
die Geschichte eme Wissenschaft, die dem
Leben am nachsten steht. Darin erkennt er
ihre Starke und ihre Schwache zugleich. Sie
erscheint ihm als die ausgesprochen inexakte
Wissenschaft, deshalb lehnt er es auch ab,
Gesetze fur sie aufzustellen. Nur vage Fest-
steilungen einer vermeintlichen Regelmassig-
keit will er gelten lasseh.
Seine Neigung, stets den Mittelweg ein-
zuschiagen, verrat Huizingas Stellung zur
Bewertung der Geschichte als Quelle der
Erkenntnis. Trotzdem Descartes diesen
Anspruch bereits abgelehnt hat, ist er doch
im neunzelmten Jahrhundert durehweg
anerkannt worden, bis Nietzsche den Histo-
rismus an den Pranger gestellt hat. Als diese
Anschauung nach dem ersten Weltkrieg all-
zu heftig durchdrang, ist sie freilich von
einem Meister wie Benedetto Croce als
Barbarei abgelehnt worden. Huizinga nimmt
emen vermittelnden Standpflikt ein, indem
er zum mmdesten der Geschichte den hehen
Wert beimisst, dass sie den Menschen vom
Egozentrismus erlose. Den Ansturm der
Soziologie wehrt er ab, das neuerdings so
populare Eindringen einer romanhaften
Darstellung historischer Personlichkeiten mi
Emil Ludwig-Ton belachelt er als „ parfii-
mlerte Geschichte ” und entschieden bekiimpft
er jene „verzerrte Geschichte”, wie sie etwa
die potitische Doktrin des Faschismus be-
fiirwortet
Als eine Probe historischer Portraitkunst
bietet das Buch ein Charakterbild Philipps
des Guten von Burgund nach der bildmassi-
gen und literarischen Uberlieferung dar. Das
Kernstuck der Sammlung aber bleibt ein
ausgedehnter Essay liber ..Wachstum un,d
Formen des nationalen Bewusstseins in
Europa bis zum Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts ”,
Hier sehopft ein verbliiffendes Wissen aus
dem Vollen. Von der Friihzeit der Entwick-
lung her werden die Begriffe Patriotismus
unci Nationalismus untersucht, .ein gewiss
sehr zeitgemasses Thema. Bei den Hellenen
findet der Forscher einen stark ausgepragten
Patriotismus neben einem nur schwach an-
gedeuteten Nationalismus. Auch im
romischen Weltreich mit seinen Dutzenden
von Volkern bleibt kein Raum fur den
nationalistischen Instinkt. Ebenso wenig
befasst sich das Christentum damit.
Aber Huizinga teilt keineswegs die land-
laufige Meinung, dass der Nationalismus
erst in der modemen Zeit entstanden sei.
Schon im Mittelalter finden sich vielmehr
seine Spuren, etwa in dem Eifer, mit dem
sich die Franken in der Lex salica selbst ein
ruhmvolles Volk nennen. Aueh im Wider-
stand gegen die deutsche Kaiserpolitik der
Staufer findet er nationalistische Spuren.
Im 14. Jahrhundert fordert Pierre Dubois als
Todfeind der Italiener die franzosische Hege-
monie in Europa und in der Renaissance
paaren sich bereits die Ideen der Staatsein-
heit mit den Anspriichen des nationalen
Interesses. Oesterreich wird erst ein Staat
nach der siegrelchen Abwehr des turkischen
Angriffs und im Elisabethinischen England
sehliesst der Nationalismus ganz einfacb die
Forderung eines kraftigen Staatswesens ein.
In der franzosischen Revolution endlich
heisst die Theorie: allgemeine Menschen-
liebe, die Praxis jedoch: Nationalismus. Die
Schlagworte; Patrie und Nation machen
als treibende Krafte eine leidenschaftliche
Vaterlandsliebe produktiv. Napoleons Im-
perialismus erstickt diese Entwicklung frei'
lich zunachst, aber Europa, das sich mit den
Waffen gegen den Kaiser wehrt, drangt die
nationalen Krafte nun endgultig in den
Vordergrund. Diese Entwicklung wird von
der Romantik vollendet, die der nationalen
Eigenart, indem sie sie kiihn iiberschatzt, zu
einem vollen Bewusstsein verhilft. In
Deutschland war allerdings der Drang zur
Einigung der Stamme durchaus noch nicht
zur allgemeinen Forderung geworden. So
betrachtet. zu Goethes Zeit, der Historiker
Heeren die deutsche Einheit als „ Grab der
Kultur und der europaischen Freiheit.”
Sogar ein der romantischen Bewegung so
nahestehender Forscher wie Jakob Grimm
sah nicht Deutschland, sondern Hessen als
sein Vaterland an.
Bei der Betrachtung dieses Problems
verrat sich Huizingas eigene national-nieder-
iandische Bmdung an ein kleineres Staats-
wesen und so findet er die „ Grosstaaterei
schummer als die Kleinstaaterei.” Im Frei-
heitsdrang der Volker verschmelzen indessen
Patriotismus umd Nationalismus: Mazzini
der Kunder der italienischen Einigun"-’
schreitet hier den deutschen Revolutionaren
des Jahres 1848 voraus. Der Sozialismus des
19. Jahrhunderts sprengte die politischen
Grenzen nach den Worten des Kommunisti-
schen Manifestes:
„ Der Arbeiter hat kein Vaterland.” Aber
im Sturmwind des ersten Kriegsjahres 1914
brach der Internationalismus zusammen.
Weiter hat der hollandische Betrachter die
Untersuchung nicht gefiihrt. Was er jedoch
liber Europas Erlebnis des Faschismus
dachte, hat er in einer Rede des Jahres 1936
deutlich gesagt. Danials bekannte er seinen
Ekel „ vor der Luge, dem Stumpfsinn, d»-
Roheit und Bosheit, deren die WeP v
scheint als je zuvor.”
In seiner letzten Lebenszeit hat h.____
ein Werk vollendet, das einen seiner Lieu
lingsgedanken in breiter Ausmalung dar-
stellt. Er gestaltet liamliph den „ H o m o
1 u d e n s,”2) den spielenden Menschen in
einer Bestimmung des Spielelements in der
Kultur.” Seltsam, dass er Schillers Lehre
des Geistes ablehnt. Aber er erkennt dem
Spiel.eine ebenso wesentliche Funktion wie
dem Schaffen zu und er stellt fest, dass die
menschliehe Kultur sich gerade im Spiel als
in ihrer eigentlichen Grundlage so recht ent-
faltet. Er verfolgt das Spiel, das ihm alter
als die Kultur erscheint, im Tierreich uud
im Triebe der Naturvolker. Dieses Lebens-
element definiert er als ,, eine freie Hand-
lung, die als ausserhalb des Lebens stehend
empfunden wird, trotzdem aber den Spieler
voliig in Beschlag nehmen _ kann. Kein
materielles Interesse ist an diese Handlung
gekniipft, kein Nutzen wird von ihr er-
worben. Sie vollzieht sich innerhalb einer
bestimmten Zeit und eines bestimmten
Raums, verliiuft ordnungsgemass nach
fester. Regeln und ruft Verbande ins Leben,
die sich gern mit einem Geheimnis umgeben
oder durch Verkleidung hervorheben. Immer
bedeutet es einen Kampf um etwas oder eine
Darstellung von etwas.”
Wie das Spiel die arehaisehe Kulthandlung
durchtrankt, wie die Chinesen in Hoflichkeit,
die Araber in Schmahreden, die altnordischen
Volker im Prahlen wetteifern, wie der Richter
mit Talar und Perriicke einen Spielcharakter
annirht. wie sogar der Krieg dieses Element
erst im totalitaren Morden vollig einbiisst,
wie die Wissenschaft der Urvolker mit Rat-
self ragen spielt — das ist der fesselnde Ver-
lauf dieser Untersuchung. Schliesslich behalt
nur noch die Dichtung den Spielcharakter,
wenn Religion, Recht, Wissenschaft, Krieg,
Politik ihn abgestreift haben. Spiel nngs-
um; in den Frage- und Antwortspielen der
Chinesen, in den Liebesihofen der Trouba-
dours, in den Trommelkampfen der Eskimos
wirdeinleuchtend gezeigt, wie Poesie aus dem
^rwiiehst. So rundet sich die EntwicK-
fung les Homo ludens. des ..Menschen im
Sifiel ” ab.
Aus dem Nachlass des niederlandischen
Forschers hat Werner Kagi endlich einen
Samntelband „ P a r e r g a ”« herausgegeben.
Das' Problem der Renaissance unter-
sucht die Geschichte dieses Begriffs, von den
Tagen an da Vasari, der Zeitgenosse und
Bioo-raph der grossen Florentiner Meister ihn
zuerst angewandt hat bis zu seiner volligen
Entfaltung durch Michelet und Jakob Burck-
hardt endlich bis zu seiner Umkehrung durch
die neuere Forschung, die ihn immer Defer
ins Mittelalter zuriiekgeschoben hat.
Daneben portratieren zwei eindringliche
Studien Geister der Vergangenheit: Johann
von Salisbury und Erasmus von Rotterdam.
Der EnHander aus dem 12 Jahrhundert, der
Vorlaufer der Humanisten, wird als „ der
Mann mit dem ernsten Lacheln ” anschaulich.
als ein ritterlicher Kleriker, der in den Sturz
dr	ischofs von Canterbury, Thomas
itrickt, seinem Oberen bis tiber
^yrertod hinaus getreu bleibt und
nt zuni Bisehof von Chartres auf-
cher Landsmann Eras-
... ner Baseler Gedenkrede,
matte des Humanisten .feiert,
ze,. e sicher der Autor alien Gefahren
der Schonfaroerei ausweicht. Denn er be-
schonigt weder die menschlichen Schwaehen
des Rotterdamers noch den Mangel an Festig-
keit in seiner geistigen Haltung. Aber
gerade in der Gegenwart des bedrohten
Europa heisst er den Geist des Denkers mit
dem Hang zum Ebenen, Schlichten, Zarten,
heisst er die Einfalt und Klarheit eines Philo-
sophen willkommen. der nur als ein schwa-
cher Christenmensch geliebt werden will. In
dieser Baseler Munster-Rede aus dem Jahre
1936 findet sich ja auch der bereits citierte
Stosseufzer uber unsere Zeit. Er zeigt, wie
gewaltig ein wahrhaft edler Zorn selbst die-
sen Mann des stillen Mittelwegs zu packen
uhd aufzuriitteln vermag.

It is pleasing to reflect that the public
mind of England has softened while it has
ripened, and that we have, in the course of
ages, become, not only a wiser, but also a
kinder people. There is scarcely a page of
the history or lighter literature of the
seventeenth century which does not contain
some proof that our ancestors were less
humane than their posterity . . . Yet, in spite
of evidence, many will still imagine to them-
selves the England of the Stuarts as a more
pleasant country than the England in which
we live . . . But, in truth, there is constant
improvement precisely because there is con-
stant discontent. If we were perfectly satis-
fied with the present, we should cease to
contrive, to labour, and to save with a view
to the future. And it is natural that, being
dissatisfied with the present, we should form
a too favourable estimate of the past.
In truth we are under a deception similar
to that which misleads the traveller in the
Arabian desert. Beneath the caravan all
is dry and bare; but far in advance, and far
in the rear, is the semblance of refreshing
waters. The pilgrims hasten forward and
find nothing but sand where, an hour before,
they had seen a lake. They turn their eyes
and see a lake where, an hour before, they
were toiling through sand. A similar illu-
sion seems to haunt nations through every
stage of the long progress from poverty and
barbarism to the highest degrees of opulence
and civilisation . . .

Stttement ofs-
K. UEBER, on the CCSCENTE/TEON C/MP,
M1UTI1AU&E;S, O/D.
To conmence this ststeinGnt I would like to affirm that
I am a German who loves his country. I am making this statement not to
appear important, but to give the truth, my wish being that those who
are responsible fox she terrible conditions in Concentration Camps will
haught and brought to justice.
■•My name, is Karl liVEBEB , born on the C7th August 1902 at
RAMSCHEIB, Rhineland. I vns a member of the hStslheliB" Organisation. The
Organisation's policy was German SSatiom-l on Democratic Menarchic^ 1 lines.
The Stalheln organisation was suppressed, in 1935. I am a journalist,
married, and since 1932 lived in Hamburg, the native citj of mj wife. My
wife became-a member of the -Luftwaffe in 1940. Heflast duty was- inspectress
of the V,omen’s Auxiliary Force in Denmark. During the past six months I-
have not had news of her. My son, Hans Hermann EBER, 11 yraes old was at
a Home school at UCKIJIAHS, I.rlin, mnd I have had no news of him.
On the 'morning of 3rd Sept. 139 I was anTcstcd at 0700 hrs
by two Gestapo agents in-my own flit. I was informed that I was a danger
to the State during, the r, ana was taken tp a Concentration Camp. After
one week, on the 10th Sept., I was taken.along with another 106 prisoners
from the Prison at Berlin to the Camp at Mauthausen, where we arrived
after three days. There commenced a period of suffering and misery. Vlords
cannot express the conditions existing within the walls of Mauthausen
Concentration Camp. Mauthausen was arf extermination Camp and as such will
go down in history as a memorial to Nazi bestiality.
At the t^me of-my'arrival there were only German prisoners
at Mauthausen, and at we saw the first we knew precisely what fate was
to be ©urs. Along the Camp pazhs there w ere no human beings, but hollow-
( eyed and starved creatures staggering around, living painfully 'from day to
' day. Untersturmfuhrer SCHDLZ. in charge of the Political department,
kicked and otherwise ill treated every onr. On arrival- the prisoners* hair
was shaved off and they were dressed in striped prison clothes. Then they
werg put in one or the other of the two Barracks. These Barracks were
built to house 140 prisoners but 8.00 were squeezed in each. The Camp
0/uarry was the most important working place. Here the prisoners worked -
under the most terrible conditions from 0700 hrs till 20C0 hrs daily. The
ration was 1/6- kilo of bread and 3/4 litre of wa.ter soup. The death roll
mounted up daily, end the Camp Commander, S.Ch. Sts tide rdenfuhrer Franz ZIERE
EIS, was obviously pleased to announce this. Pie lived on the Mauthausen
estate. In the quarry the prisoners were killed in the following way:-
They were forced to climb a stone stairway of about 160 steps carrying
stones weighing 50 or 60 Kgs. Others were thrown in the river and held
under the water until they drowned. The official term to cover these deaths
.was "Voluntary Euicide." Many prisoners preferred to run over the bound-
ary chain and were shot by the sentries. This was termed: "Shot while
trying to escape. Jews lived a very short time. On arrival in Camp their
pc.'MSessioxis were plundered by the Guards and they were exterminated in thf.
following way:- In the quarry was a rock about 15 to 20. metres long and
the exhausted Jew^s were driven over the quarry edge in groups of 8 or 10
at a time, all holding hands, onto this rdxck ebott 50 metres below. They
called this form of death the "Parachute hunt." Broken limbs and pieces
of brain were scattered over the extent of this rock and other prisoners
were made to collect the pieces and carry them to the Crematorium. This﻿Pfege T'aq... '
was not exceptional, the killings were done thoroughly and calmly. Dur-
ing the ?,inter of 1939 - 1940 I was sent to the ”Lageraufb*u Gusen"
prison, where there were 400 prisoners. The cruelty meted out here was
horrible, every, morning the prisoners were sent 6 kms to the place of
work. On arrival they were made to remove coats, jackets, ear protectors,
and gloves in a temperature of 11 degrees below Zero. Only'the strongest
and firmest willed could hope to survive. In the evening the dying and
the dead were'heaped on • lorry like animals and tskeA back to Camp. The
survivors went back o,. foot.' Replacements kept the prisoner strength at
a constant 400. -
The most dreaded punishment was the "Isolation'’. Everyone who
could still creep was sent into this section, where they were separated
by a high barbed -ire fence from thexreSt. Even in the coldest pert of
Winter all windows were removed, nd the prisoner's Middled close togeth-
er on the stinking straw for warmth. Broken in tody arid spirit, and
without medical attention, they came close to death. That was the "Isol-
ation Section." In the lavatories tht dead were, heaped' up and sometimes
remained tv-o or three days before they were removed. It was not uncommon
for rats to start eating the bodies.
The least f-ult was r ever by planished. Those who put down their i
shovel or hot were punished on the following Friday by two famous sadist
£.3. men'specially appointed.. The vieiiarwas made to'lie-’ok a specially;
constructed cheir >lth their buttocks raised up end their hands end feet
were tied down. They were given £5 or more strokes with.a whip, the
blows usually’ falling too high so that the kidneys were struck. Often
the prisoners were allowed to free themselves, and preferred ts run onto
the electrically charged fencing,’ there to find surcease from their
pain. This was not, however, the worst of the punishments inflicted.
A worse one was called the "Tree hanging.® The prisoners arms were tied
behind with rope while the prisoner stood on a chair. Then the rope was
thrown over' • beam,■and tightened until the prisoners were hanging free.
The weight of the body .mode the- rope cut into the arms, and often dis-
located the. shoulder blades, the hands and arms became.swollen.•The
tormentors walked In front of the prisoners laughing .nd smoking, feme
times to acid weight they would swing on the feet of the victims, while
sweet and blood ran down to the ground..When the prisoners fainted they
were revived by a cold shower. Often after this ordeal they, were ’unable t
to move a finger for weeks and had to he fed like Rabies. At the begin-
ning, of 1941 [ was appointed block Friter, end shortly after that Camp•
writer. As such I was in a responsible position, and could ease in s.
small Tfisy the misfortunes of some of the nameless prisoners. At the
beginning of 194< the period of shooting commenced. On an average 30
Poles were shot each evening. These prisoners were taken .during the
afternoon from their work and in the evening were killed by shooting ss
they marched along. This continued for several weeks, and there were
streams of blood at the place of execution, behind the workshops. In
spite of all this the extermination machine was not running quickly
enough. ■	.
A plan was, therefore, devised without■parallel in history. At
noon on parade the prisoners were ordered to remain in place. The Com-
zander and about 15'civilians arrived,nd walked round the parade scrutini,
j’sing the men. Every third or fourth prisoner was called’out and the
Commander had « few words with him. He was then made to go back to his
p-i-sce in the line, or was called to one side where'the Political Dept,
took his name and number. In the front line they always put the oldest
prisoners: the weak and the undesirable prisoners came in for special
consideration, for they had seen too much. This parade lasted until
1800 hrs-by which time about 800 people had been specially listed. No-
body knew the reason for this. One day, soon after that, the first 70 prj﻿Three,

nightly transports arrived from everywhere, Germans, Poles and Czecns,
these latter being connected with the Heydrich affair. There were also
women who soon after they were arrested were shot, hit later on, to avo^d

8-10 pe©pic' drily. The most ing'enlous device was invented by the xom-
asnder himself. A hermetically seeled lorry was. leden with prisoners who

Through a small hole he threw e gss bomb into the interior of the lorry
where"the victims vcrc enclosed, and then he drove off. After about an noui

persons were killed ft 7r;uthr usen. from 19?9 to 1947. then prisoners r.rieo

READ THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY.
1. You are requested to set out, in accordance with the directions below, such knowledge as you may have on the subject
of War Crimes. By doing so you may be the means of establishing the identity of persons who have committed offences
against Prisoners of War and others, and the particulars you are able to give may be an important contribution towards
their subsequent trial and punishment.	,,
Therefore it is important that you should give your detailed information with the greatest possible care and accuracy
in the columns provided overleaf.
2.	War Crimes can be divided into two classes of offence :—
(a)	Criminal Acts in Transit or in Camp.
Examples are :—shooting and killing without justification, shooting and killing on the false pretence that the
prisoner was escaping, assault with violence causing death, and other forms of murder or manslaughter; shooting,
wounding with bayonet, beating, torture, unjustified violence, and other forms of ill-treatment causing the infliction of
grievous bodily harm; theft of money and goods.
Under this head give in the columns overleaf the most exact information you have as to any such case. State, if
you can, the names of those who committed the offence, as well as the names of any other enemy personnel such as Camp
Commandant, Superior Officers or N.C.O.’s who may in some degree be responsible. If possible, give also the names
and full particulars of any other witnesses of the offence.
(b)	Violations of the Geneva Convention and of the rules of warfare, whether in Transit or in Camp.
Examples are :—unjustified imprisonment; insufficient food, water and clothing; lack of medical attention; bad
treatment in hospitals; unhealthy conditions in Camp; employment on work having direct connection with the operations
of the war, or on unhealthy or dangerous work; being detained in an area exposed to the fire of the fighting zone; being
used as a screen; and such cases as attacks on hospitals or hospital ships, and on merchant ships without making pro-
vision for survivors; interrogation by third degree or other forcible methods.
Under this head, give brief particulars, with places and dates in the columns provided overleaf.
3.	The above examples are only given as a general guide, and if you have knowledge of different kinds of war crimes
committed (not necessarily against Ps/W only) you are requested to give similar particulars of them.﻿Date, Camp

(Gusen
Concentration
Camp).
During R.A.F. raid on Linz on or about 24th July, 1944} I
saw bailed out airmen who were coming down v/ithin 200 yds of
this camp shot by the S3 when they were within 20 yds of the
ground. Two others who had landed were taken and then shot
in the back of the head.
In March, 1945, we were taken daily to Linz to clear up v/rec
age on railway due to R.A.F. bombing. While there fresh
homhing of Hermann Goering korke at Linz and Steyregg cut the
line back to Gusen and we were kept in Linz No. 3 camp for
about three weeks. Food was very bad, there was no water for
washing. We slept on wet and muddy floors in our wet clothes,
no blankets were issued. The blocks vrere shock full of lice.
On the 21st April in the Infirmary at K.L.Gusen such as
were in a very had physical condition, terribly weak and thin,
and likely to cause embarrassment to the Germans when the
Allies arrived in the camp, were separated. They were placed
in Block 21 Room B and later that night were all gassed. Those
trying to escape hy breaking through the windows were shot by
sentries posted for that purpose. That night 350 died.

Statement of:- Karl YfflEElR,
Villacherstrasse 79> KLAGSHPURT
Employed by P.W.B. as Chief Reporter.
I am a German, born at REMSGHEID, Rhineland, on
the 27th* August, 1502, I was a member of the STAIiHiLH Organisation.
The organisation’s policy was Democratic on Monarchial Lines. This
organisation was supressed in 1939« I am a journalist, married,
and was living since 1932 in HAMBURG.
Cn the morning/of the 3r<3, September, 1939 > I
was arrested at 07.00 hours by two Gestapo Agents at ray flat. The
name of one of the agents was BERGER. I was informed that I was
a danger to the ■ state during wartime and was taken to the
Concentration Gamp at MUTMUSM,where I arrived on the 10th.
September. 10S other prisoners arrived there together with me.
There commenced a period of suffering and misery. Words cannot
express the conditions of this camp.
At the time of ny arrival there were only
German prisoners in MUTHAUSEIT and when we saw them we knew exactly
what fate was in store for us. The prisoners were hollow-eyed
and starved, were staggering around and were living painfully. I
saw Untersturmfuehrer SpKULTZ, who was in charge of the Political
Section, strike the- prisoners with an oxtail whip. , I myself was
struck at least 20 times by SCHULTZ and lost four teeth by his
beatings. Most of the 106 prisoners, who went with me are now
dead. I remember two who were still alive at the beginning of
I945, They were:-	y
Heinrich GAS!EEl©CRlER, a Communist from HAMBURG.
Dr. Med, ^ICHSELSDO’AER, from HAMBURG District.
Upon arrival at !,!AUTHAUSEH all prisoners had their
hair shaved off and received striped prison clothes. Later they
were detailed to one of two wooden huts. These huts were built
to hold 140 prisoners but 800 were squeezed into each one. The
Prisoners had to work from 07.00 hours Until 20,00 hours under the
most difficult conditions.
Our dailjr rations were l/8 kg. Bread and 3/4 litre
water soup. On these rations we had to perform the hardest work,
camp construction, stone breaking and stone carrying. I saw many
who died at this work by ill teatment, I remember that one morning
20 died from a section of 50 workers, T^.e Gcmnandant of the Camp
at that time was SS Sturmfuhrer Franz ZJffibllS. Rene KORSIZKI,^
S3 Untersturmfuhrer, was in charge of my Section, I have seen
K0RSIZKT knock prisoners to the ground and stamp on their faces
with the heels of his boots, I have seen prisoners killed by this
method, Heinrich GAMFSLD0R2ER was present when these cruelties
took palace.
I have also seen prisoners killed in the following
manner:- The prisoners, including myself, were forced to climb
up a stone stairway of 160 steps carrying stones weighing 150 to ■
160 Kgs, For this task superhuman efforts were necessary. Many
collapsed and I have seen thosp'who did so shot with a pistol by
S3 Unterscharfuhrer Peter i,Tj£J?GElJ, Many prisoners preferred to
run over the boundary chain and be shot.
To sheet 2/
am﻿2.
VJ
Other prisoners, in despair, clianbed to the head of the
cliff 8 to 10 at a time holding hands, most of them ^Tevre, and
leaped down into the quarry where they lay with broken limbs.
In an ironical manner GO Hauptscharfuhrer 3PAT2E13GGS1\T asked the
Jews to end their lives in this manner. In the *uamp this kind of
death was known as 'The parachute Jump'. The broken limbs and
parts of brains were removed by specially detailed prisoners and
had to be delivered to the Crematorium, Furthermore, these
specially selected prisoners had to clean the blood from the
face of the cliff, I have witnessed all these happenings.
S3 Unterscharfuhrer VIEniAIIER is responsible for the death
of many prisoners who were dr aimed in a pond, which was in the
Quarry area, I have seen VffiHIMJER and his mates throw prisoners
into the pond and hold their heads under the water with long
poles totil they were drowned. I do not know the names of the
mates as they were changed daily.

Otto KLEIHGUEFTHER, SDG, 33 Unterscharfuhrer, Commandantur-
stal, also .a member of the Management of MUTHAHSEi! Camp, told me,
in the presence of his friend BIKDER, that he has killed about'
1,000 prisoners in MAtfHAUSEN by injections of chemicals. I
know that, before Germany surrendered, ELE1NGUENIHER wras
employed by the 33 Feldarb§iter Sammelstelle BEHLII'T -
Lichterfelde His family is living in Vienna. The upper
part of his right thumb is totally deformed. The nail is
split and the upper part wider than normal.
During the winter of 1939 - 4-0, I ■went to the
Lageraufban, GWSEN, returning every evening to the MAUTHAUSEN
Camp, ?/e were 400 prisoners including myself. After arrival
at Lageraufban GWSEN, 6 kilometres from MAUTHAUSEN, we had to
remcyve our coats, jackets, ear protectors and gloves in a
temperature of 20 degrees below zero. Only the strongest
could stand this treatment. In the evening I saw the dead and d
dying loaded like animals into a truck and transported back
to the. camp. The survivors marched back. Replacements kept the
party permanently at a strength of 400 men.
Mostly the prisoners feared to be sent to the
"Isolation Section" at MAUTHAUSEN Camp. Everyone who could still
crawl was detailed to this section. This section was separated
from the rest of the camp by barbed wire fencing. In my capacity
as Camp Clerk I had to register, every morning, inside the
'Isolation', the dead prisoners of the past 21- hours. Even in
the coldest weather all windows were removed and the prisoners /

and the prisoners/
huddled together on rotten straw. I have seen, that in this
Isolation Section, the hodies of prisoners were heaped up in
the lavatory and abolution room. There were lying there
sometimes two or three days before they were removed. This
'Isolation', whilst not to be considered as a hospital, was
intended to take in the sick people of the camp, and all in
the same room were cases of T.B., broken legs, appendicitis
and abcess all together. SJo beds were available and only one
blanket. The straw was never changed. The responsibility
was Dr. KRUE 's, Lagerarzt, Gamp Doctor.
The least fault was severely punished. Those
who put down their pick and shovel for a moment were punished
on the following Friday by two famous sadist SS men specially
chosen for this job. It was not always the same S3 men who
dealt this punishment but the following S3 men were the most
frequently chosen. Commandant 2£EKSIS angfbinted thdse men. xy
Mostly theyj/dre:- 1EIS3E, HI&PGEN, SEIDEL, KORSTTZI, ECKERT
and 3TREITW3E3ER. The prisoner was tied to a kind of wooden
chair, the legs fastened to the chair by clamps, and he had
to grip a wooden bar at the bottom. On each side of him stood
an SS man,each one with an oxtail whip. Alternately they
struck the prisoner who had to count the strokes up to 25.
Mostly the kidneys were struck. This punishment was executed
during lunch hour when all prisoners were on parade. I saw
this every Friday until 192^. Later the punishment was
executed in a separate hut :ancl no more by the SS men but- by
the prisoners, I sat/ prisoners, in order to avoid this
punishment, run into the electric wire fence and commit suicide.
One of these was HERZ, the clerk of the prison clothes store.
When the punishment was finished the prisoner had to report to
the SS Commander concerned and had to say "Prisoner X Y punished
with 25 strokes because I smoked during working hours. I thank
you". I have also seen prisoner's, after receiving this
punishment, run into the electric wire fence to avoid making
this report. Assisting in the punishment were alternately,
As an alternative punishment, and for
interrogation purposes, another kind of punishment was ordered
called Tree. This punishment was also ordered by ZLEKEIS
and BACHMAYR. In this case the prisoner's arms were tied
behind his back with rope, then he had to mount on a ohair.
The rope was then fixed on a beam and the chair taken away,
leaving the prisoner hanging free. The. weight of his body
caused the x'ope to penetrate the flesh of his hands. The arms
swelled and the shoulder blades became dislocated. The
tormentors walked in front of the prisoners, laughing and
smoking. Sometimes, to increase the pain, the SS man hung
himself on the legs of the hanging prisoner. It was the
same people that did the whipping at the chair that hung
themselves on the legs of the prisoners. Yi/hen one of the
prisoners lost conscience by this punishment he had a bucketful
of water thrown in his face. Often after this ordeal they were
unable to move a finger or their arms and had to be fed like
babies. I have myself been tortured in this manner. I hung
for one hour on the Tree. I was sicj/^for three weeks and
could not move my arms, as a mattej^of fact I still feel the
consequences. Hauptscharfuhrer Y2EISSE and Unterscharfuhrer
VrSIEADER were responsible for the execution of this punishment
upon myself.

upon myself/
At the beginning of 1942, a period of shooting
commenced. At 18.00 hrs every evening, all the prisoners
were on parade. Before parade started named were called
out according to blocks. The prisoners whose names were
so called were paraded at the main guard tower. The tower
was at the entrance to the parade ground, visible to arerybody.
Shortly after, those whose named had been called and had been
marched away, I heard shots fired at regular intervals. I
was regularly present at these evening parades and heard the
names called out of those who were marched away. Later in
the evening I received a list from the camp Office with the advise
to cross out the prisoners on that list as dead. I had seen
these same people that evening as they marched away from the parade
to the tower. This lasted several weeks and concerned mostly
Polish students and Polish priests. The first times after these
parades I went the following morning behind the workshops in the
neighbourhood of the tower. I saw there pools of blood covered
with sand. In a sand wall near the pools of blood I saw bullet
holes at a height corresponding to the size of a human being.
The crematorium at IIAUTHAliSEN kept 14 prisoners busy,
including bpdy carriers and oven personnel. These 14 worked in
two shift/, day and night.	The foreman of the crematorium was
Franz SU30K, a German, a Cremator by profession, also a prisoner
at MAuTHAuSKR. After work finished the body carriers came to
their blocks and told us what they had seen during the evening,
meaning that they had to carry the bodies of young Poles with shots
in their back. I believe that the complete personnel of the
crematorium were shot before the Americans arrived.
At a parade held at noon on a day in the summer of 1942,
ZIEHEIS appeared with 15 civilians, who, I believe, were doctors.
Every prisoner" had to pass in front of these civilians.	The
prisoners went either back to their place or were separated and their
numbers taken by the Political Section. Generally the Y/eakest and
suffering prisoners were put separate, but also those were added whom
ZIEBSIS wanted to get rid of. A prisoner whose name was Karl HEEMAET,
a Medical Orderly of the Gamp, whose home is in VIENNA, was one of
those who were separated from us.	The parade lasted ’until 1800 hrs,
by which time about 800 prisoners had been selected and separated from
the parade. I do not know the reason why this separation took place.
One day, shortly after, the first TP of the 800 selected
were loaded into two buses and driven away wearing only shirt and trousers.
The windows of the buses were covered. During the following two and
a half Tveeks these transports of 70 prisoners vrere repeated daily. Later
the shirts and trousers of the prisoners were returned, but no prisoners
came back.	I am sure that the numbers on the trousers and shirts
were the same as the numbers of the departed prisoners. Haupscharfuhrer
WKEHE was in charge of these transports. I received daily a list
of 70 names from SCHULZ, Political Section, with the order to cross
these 70 names from the strength of the Camp. The names on the
lists corresponded with the names of the disappeared prisoners. The
trousers and shirts came back from the ex-asylum at YBBS, also there were
returned the Artificial legs and arms. Official reports state that
the cause of the deaths was T.B., heart trouble, appendicitis, etc.
TO Sheet 5/-﻿5.

appendicitis, etc./
In the meantime gas chambers were prepared in the
camp. The transport of prisoners was stopped and those people,
instead of being taken away, were put into this gas chamber.
I have seen this gas chamber and it was made to give the
impression that it was a modern shower bath. I have seen
40 to 50 nude prisoners go into the gas chamber with soap and
towel. Mien the prisoners had entered the gas chamber, the
doors were closed and hermetically sealed. It was reopened
after two hours and I saw the gassed dead bodies lying around.
The gas chamber was underground and connected directly with
the crematorium.
In the neighbourhood of the crematorium, connected
by corridors, were the so-called "Heckshot Rooms" The
prisoners were put into this room singly and told that their
height was going to he measured, their head to be facing the
wall. As soon as they were in this position they were
immediately shot through the neck. Nightly, there arrived
transports at MAUTHAUSEN, bringing Germans, Poles and Zcheos,
the latter in connection with the UETDRIGH affair. Also
Nollec women were brought. The men were shot in the neck shot
room, the women received towel and soap, told to take a bath
and were killed by gas. The murder of the Zchecs took place
on the 27th* January,1943«
a special
Also, in 1942, 50 prisoners were killed


system invented by 33- Sturmbannfuhrer Dr, Med. KBE^SAOII. The
victims were brought,20 at a time, to the camp hospital. They
were told that their bandages were going to be changed.
Singly, they were presented to the Doctor. The prisoner had
to lay down on a table as if he were being examined. Doctor
KREBSBACH thrust a needle into the heart of the prisoner, the
result was immediate death. One after the other they were
killed in this manner. I heard these facts from the prison
orderlies, who were present when these operatiorm/'took place.
The name of one of these two orderlig^was llOLLiTSCH, from
VIENNA. The other's name is Dr. RIGIITER from REIGHEHEES®,
Sudetenland. I have also seen bodies which have been killed
by these heart-thrusts. These prisoners were also struck
off the strength as having died through natural causes.
Later, a new method of killing commenced. The
victim was chloroformed with ether and was afterwards injected
in the arm with petx-ol or paraffin. Thousands of Poles,
Germans;, Zchecs, Slovenes and Jews were so killed. Besides
Dr. KEEBSJSACH, it was mainly SS Unterscharfuhrer KLEIlIGUSintlER
who took part in this,and who was responsible. KLEINGUEMHSR
killed daily 8 to 10 people. I have also seen these dead bodies
with marks of the needle in the arms.
Another kind of murder, invented by ZIERBIS
personally, was the following;- About 20 prisoners were put
into an entirely enclosed car, the ear moved away with ZINE3I3
driving. During the journey, a gas bomb was thrown into the
car, killing the prisonei’s inside who were later taken to the
crematorium. I saw when these people were put into the car
and saw also the dead bodies returned when the journey was
finished.
To sheet 6/﻿6
^	journey was finished/
When an escaped prisoner was recaptured, the whole
camp was on Parade and the prisoner's band was forced to play
a reception march. The recaptured prisoner was forced to say
"G-ood morning friends, I am back." The prisoner was then
fastened to the whipping chair and received 25 or mere strokes.
Then he was given three solitary confinement and then hanged,
the complete camp being on parade.
In one case I saw the body of a fugitive brought back
to camp fastened in an open coffin and exhibited for all to see.
The prisoners, band had to play a tango in front of the coffin
and during the playing the body was carried to the crematorium.
About the end of 1944 Dr. EEEBS^lcH had the devilish
idea to have lampshades and. ladies' hand bags made from tattoed
human skin. I saw the lampshades in the mess of the SS Leaders.
The tattoes were in the form of women's heads, flayers, animals
and obscene designs.
Another form of punishment devised by ZIEEEIS for
very minor offences, or interrogation purposes, was the
chaining of prisoners to rings fixed in a wall near the camp
entrance. The prisoners were chained with their hands behind
their backs to a ring which was about on the level with their
shoulders. In this position the blood circulation was stopped
and their hands became terribly swollen. There they would be
left for 24 to 36 hours, in terrible agony, and without food
and water. In every case one or more of these prisoners died
whilst chained to the ring. I have seen many dead prisoners
hanging from the chains. Should a prisoner faint or collapse,
ZIE3EIS, the Camp Commandant, would throw a bucket of water
in his face to see whether or not he had really fainted. I have
heard prisoners in/the chainswdry out and groan in agony. I
have also seen GG&L, and VElilAUER, and other SS men whose names
I do not remember, kick the prisoners in their stomach and
strike them in the face with their fists,without any reason,
whilst they were passing. Part of the prisoners punished in
this manner were Dutch intellectuals, mostly Jewish but also
Catholic. Chaplain SAELZLE from HJERTTEMBERG, and Padre
M003BAUER from Lins, CEERDCHAU, were also ill treated in this
manner and survived the punishment. These two underwent the
punishment at the end of 1942.
When visitoi’s were expected, specially chosen prisoners
were ordered to stay in groups near a Model Block (ho.2). They
were made to chat and smoke together and sat at little tables,
reading or playing skat or chess. These prisoners were taught
to reply to questions andcreate a good impression, I v/as
present on one occasion when an Oberstleutnant of the Welirmacht
was rather astonished when he saw the iron rings in the wall
near the camp entrance. lie asked the Gommandant what the rings
were for and he was told the peasants used them to tether their
horses to when they came to carry away the manure.
On the 2nd. June,1943, I was posted, together with
330 other prisoners, 300 French and 30 of other nationalities,
to LOIBL PASS to work on tunnel construction. Later, the
working party was increased to 1200. SS Hauptsturmfuhrer WIiaCGES
was Camp Commandant. I stayed at Loibl Pass until the surrender
of Germany. All that I know about Loibl Pass, I have told to
Captain DAWSON, 77 S.I.B., together with Mr. Luois BALSAM, who
was also a prisoner at Loibl Pass.

The attached copy of a German document
shows that J4.7 men were shot at MAUTHAUSEN on 6th and
7th September IsMt* Of these, 29 are Dutch nationals,
1 a l.S.A. citizen and 7 are hritish officers. The
7 British officers were employed by this section.
It appears likely that all the persons named
on the attached lists were formerly detained in the
camp at EAVITSGH, as it is known that in April ijkk a
convoy arrived at that camp consisting of 19 British
officers Including five out of the seven on the attached
list, and 52 Dutchmen. It is probable that the two
British officers not previously known to have been at
RAVITSCH (Lt. CU-fiENT and Lt. BLOOM) arrived at
KAVlTSCh in a later convoy which reached the camp in
May 19l4t.
The note appended to the list of prisoners
(dated 5th dime) executed at MAUTHAUSEN states thatj-
9Josef PilLEKK, Uenaan '‘Kapo" of the
Strafkompanie at Mauthausen, was present
on the 6th Bept. at these executions. He
is now in the American gaol at Mauthausen.
The executioners were -
B.B. man QOGKEL,/{Serman)
S.S. man KIS^H (Jugoslav)
under orders from damp Commandant 2EKEIS (in
U.h. custody now).9
I should welcome additional infonaa
these executions. (1 assume that the bodies
cremated arm that no personal belongings of
were found), or any other Information which
interest to the relatives of these victims.

Interrogation of Willi Rothenh6fer
bom iriaoT
Rastatt, Hochfeldstr
h
,	Source was arrested in January 1936 and confined in the Zuchthaus
at Ludwigsburg. In 1943 he was transferred to Ulm where he spent 14 days, and thence
to Natzweiler where he arrived on 23.3*43.
At Natzweiler he was first place in Block 1, then he fell sick and was
in the Revier. On discharge from the latter he was detailed to Block 8 (later
renumbered ll) as Stubenaitester. In August 1943 he became Barrackenfl-ltester, soon
lost this appointment, but was reinstated in November 1943. Source left Natzweiler
for Dachae in September 1944 and soon afterwards reached Mauthausen, at which camp he
was liberated.
I.	Natzweiler
(l) Source states that conditions were easier under Hartjenstein than Cramer.
Thinks that former was officer from Wehrmacht.
Lagerftihrer = Wolfgang Scuss.
The politische Abteilung
Wochner (home address Heilbronn)
Hoos
Plus Conrad Schultz (a prisoner of doubtful reliability.
The Crematorium
Peter Straub
helped by a prisoner Franz Berg of Lu&Yfigshaven/^iannheim, and by
two gipsies.
Source states that the staff of these two branches should best be.able
to give information on prisoners detained or killed in the camp.
(2) Allied Airmen brought to Nazweiler,
Source first heard of allied airmen from Franz Berg in February 1944.
Franz Berg said "Es is wie&er etuas besonderes gewesen, es sind welche
gefangene flieger angekommen".
Source states that Berg told him that sometimes these airmen arrived dead
at the camp, and sometimes alive, (he thinks that this conversation took
place later than Berg's first remarks in February 1944). In. November
1944 Berg told source that "mehrere Flieger" had been killed in the
crematorium building, and that Peter Straub had taken their valuables.
Berg had had a watch from an airman himself but had given it to Straub.
Source states that Berg said that at first all airmen were brought to
Sicherheitspolizei officials who remained to convince themselves that
not only the body but all clothing and equipment had been burnt. Later
when airmen were brought by SS, the clothes were not burnt but handed
out to "reliable" guards.
(3)	Blockfuhrer in August 1944.
Source only remembers one -
Hoffmann (home address Kehl)
states that Peter Fuchs left for a branch camp at the beginning of July
1944, and that he only saw him very occasionally thereafter.
(4)	Arrival of prisoners.
Source states that prisoners fetched by Peter Straub were driven direct
to the crematorium, near which were the cells in which they could be
placed until required.
Feeding of prisoners in cells.
Russian prisoners under control of Straub Were employed as carriers of
food to the cells.
(5)﻿The Englishwoman.
Source heard of two English and two Frenchwomen, arrested for espionage and
transferred from Paris. Sent another prisoner whose Christian name was Anton
to cells to find out their names: heard, but has forgotten.
(Anton sent to Zuchthaus, Indwigsburg, with a French colonel in September 194^t-).
(7) Other English at Natzweiler
Remembers a father and son who he states left before September 1944. Thinks
in July.
Knew two Englishmen, one
another Englishman smaller and dark. States both these left in September 1944.
f ft wo
(8) Ex-Erisoners who may be able to supply information.
"Bob5* aged 26/28, tall and fair haired, who ms with
Wagner, a dentist from Luxemburg who ms made to pull out gold teeth and
bridges from corpses (ms released from Schutzhaft and should be at
home).
Franz Berg, a former pimp of Mannheim Ludwigshaven. States that Berg fearing
that he knew too much reported sick at Dachau. Source states that
Berg left Dachau with 10 others for Buchenwald "zu versuchszwecken".
States that if Berg still alive, will certainly have returned to
Mannheim/Ludwigshaven.
(Four Franz Bergs live at Ludwigshaven, if time permits they Yri.ll be
checked).
Rausch who was made to place nooses round prisoners necks in crematorium.
Hans Gascfa tobacconist of Ettlingen,
Source mentions Koszlik, Kauten (the Revier Kapo), and Robert Leuthold as
"bad prisoners", unreliable, giving information to the camp staff and
witholding information from the prisoners. He calls them a two faced triangle.
(Kauten ms popular with Rhode).
.." .......... ....'
i
II. Mauthausen
Source arrived here Oct/tlov. 1944.
(l) Allied Airmen
States that Blocks 19 and 20 were in a special enclosure, and that prisoners
confined there were on half rations. To be placed in this enclosure v/as a
certain step to liquidation.
Source saw Russian officers, allied airmen, and some German wehrmacht here.
Heard of 5 allied airmen who load been shot down in neighbourhood who were made
to stand in the gateway of the camp while amiting admission. Believes this
happened in 1943.
In March 1945 he himself saw a further 5 or 6 including one wounded who ms
varried on a stretcher; all were taken to the cells.
In the Weberei at Mauthausen, source saw a pile of clothing consisting of
airmen's fur lined boots, leather helmets and jackets, and combination overalls.
Source considers that there were at least 40 sets.
(2)	Further witnesses for Mauthausen,
/
i. Dr. Stich from Prague.	.
flelnrlcIiiCo^ri^m Trague./
"SoiSce*men?"xonB" TfW","EPET^r as particularly well informed,
iii. Marschallek - a Czech now in Vienna.
ii.
Rothenhttfer gives a good impression as a witness. His memory is fairly good
and he appears to take care not to pass on information acquired from others as his own.
He is also careful not to exaggerate.

Tout autour, se dercule un rcagnifique panorama, la vallee du
DAoJLji aver au loin le massif des Alpes, a I'oppose les Monts de Boheme et
leurs for^ts de saping. Bn face se trouve une jolie petite villeT ENNSr au
confluent du Danube et de la riviere portant le mSme nom.
Le climat est tres dur. Dans la m^rae journee on assite sou-
vent a des ecarts de temperature import nts. On passe d'un temps calme,
avec un soleil brQlant, a une tempete de bourrasque, de pluie et de froid,
en moins de deux heures.
Le camp est entierement isole de la petite ville de MAUTHAUSEN
qui se trouve a 5 Kms et personae n'a le droit de s1en approcher, sous peine
d £tre immediatement fusille par les sentinelles. De grands murs de pierres
allant jusqu'a 6 metres de hauteur et de place en place, des miradors, ou
se trouvent les sentinelles armees d’armes automatiques. Le s.ommet des murs
est garni de 5 fils electriques a haute tension, Autour de cette enceinte se
trouve encore un reseau circulaire de fil de fer barbele et derriere encore
un autre cordon de sentinelles.
Entre les murs et cette deuxieme enceintej se trouvent les
differents ateliers necessaires a I'entretien du camp, les magasins, garages
et les blocs servant de casernement aux SS assurant la garde, En dehors de
la deuxieme enceinte se trouvent la carriere, les ateliers d'armement et un
certain ncmbre de'commandos (silos, station de pompes etc.,)
L'interieur de la premiere enceinte se divise en 3 carats :
Camp n® 1 : "camp dit libre!', corapraamt 15 blocs. En plus, isoles par un
mur electrifi.e, 5 blocs,-d^ut 4 de quaraintaine_ «u semi-quaran-
taine et 1 bloc servant d'annexe a la prison du camp.
Camp n° 2 *t nn 3 sent des camps do qu&rantaine composes chacun de 3 blccs
pour loger les detenus en instance de mort lente.
En face de ees trois camps et toujours a i'interieur de 1'en-
ceinte, se trouvent : la blanchisserie, la prison, les fours crematoires et
une infirmerie ou ne sont soignes qua le personnel administratif et quelques
Priv:i-lcgi®s du - oort» «u de 1'influence.
Dans le camp n° .1, les detenus couchalent dans les lits de
70 cm de largeur et a un ou deux stages. En principe deux detenus couchaient
dans un lit.
Mais dans les camps n° 2 et 3 in fajon de loger les detenus
etait epruvantable, Les detenus couchaient sur 1c plancher entasses les uns
eur les autres "en sardines" e'est—a—dire que chacun avait les pieds de son
voisin sur la figure, sans la moindre pcssibilite de se retourner, de sorte,
^qu'en depit de 1'extreme fatigue, la majeure partie des prijS.enniers pou—
valent dorair.
Te ler camps de MAUTHAUSEN etait ere 4 par le gouvernement

II va sans dire, que les detenus d'alors, jouissaient d'un

Cette carriere et cat escalier etaient temoins depuis 193o d'actes de
oauvagerie, de sadisnie et d'assassinate horribles, des dizaines de milliers
de prisonniers, par les 3S at lours valets tele que: Zaremba, ynek, laissant

A Mauthausen,les SS tortionnaire et leurs vildts, les criminelS detenu
de droit commun,ont realise des’fortunes ooloSsales.
Parmi les centaines de mille de prisonniers passes au camp,etai^nt
des personnes de conditions sociales differentes. Certains detenus avaient sur
eux des fortunes de bijoux et de vcleurs depassants 10 millions or.
Mais une fois entre au camp,tout le monde ete.it depouille,et sortait
des douches avec comme unique bien une chemise,un calecon et pas toujours une
paire des ignobles sabots reglementaires Les fortunes des prisonniers,leur linge,
leur vtement etaient ensuite 1a proie des bandits en uniformes et des detenus
de droit conunun,complices des SS < Ils trfiiicuaient 1'or,les bijoux,les montres
ils crganisaient m@tr.e tout un sefvice d'echanges avec la population civile, pour
se creer des conditions de vie materieile enviables pour beaucoup d'hommes dite-

Ils prossedaient de solid©s comptes en banque et quantite d'or et de
metaux precieux caches en prevision de leur retour h la vie civile.

Dear Captain Galitzine,
Je vous adresse oi-joint une copie d'une nouvelle lettre
que m'adresse Monsieur Pistora relative au massacre de 48
officiers allies, le 6 Septembre 1944.
Peut-etre avez-vous la possibilite de vous mettre direc-
tement en contact avec le Professeur KEUVTRT de Moravska

Monsieur
Le Lt.Cmdr. P.A. O'Leary,
4 Rue de Valois,
Paris ler.
Mon cher Ami,
Je m' enrpresse d' accuser reception de ta lettre du 1. courant
et je te donnerai Men volontiers tons les renseignements que je possede
sur le massacre de 48oofficiers des Forces Alliees en date du 6 et 7
Septenibre 1944 a Mauthausen.
Ces officiers sont venus, en uniformes allies, le 6 Septembre
au matin, envoyes par le Coramandement de 1'axmee allemande de 1'Quest.
Ils sont restes debout au mur a 1«entree que tu connais bien,
jusqu'a 13 heures. Pendant oe laps de temps, ils etaient "enregistresS
regulierement, tondus, douches, habilles avec des haillons rayes et leur
No inscrit avec le crayon d'encre sur la poitrine.
L*enregistrement (Aufnahme) de ces officiers anglais et Hollandais
etait fait par le Secretaire de la Schreibstube, mon ami, P. DOBIAS, qui
se trouve actuellement en Tchecoslavaquie. Mon ami Dobias m'expliquait le
soir meme, que pqrmi ces officiers, il^y avait plusieurs officiers supeneurs.
A 13 heures oes 48 hommes sont partis a la carriere et dans
I'apres-midi (du 6 Septembre) 21 furent tues.
Vers 1? heures, j'ai vu personnellement 1'entree des hommes restants
(27), environnes par les SS en armes, diriges sur pa prison du camp (Buncker)
et trainant des voiturettes charges des cadavres de leurs caraarades abattus.
Ces 27 officiers ont passe la nuit a la prison (Buncker).
Lendemain (le 7 Septembre) ils sont sortis apres le " Kommandos ",
c'est-a-dire vers 7.30 heures et immediatement dans le cheirdn qui menait a
la carriers, ils furent tues a coup des mitraillettes et fusils-mitrailleurs.
A 8 heures, tout etait fini.
Mon ami DOBIAS, et le "Capo" de la"Politische-Abteilung"-, Prof. NEUVIRT del
Moravska Ostrava, qui est aussi mon ami, connaissent les noms de ces victimes,
les adresses en Angleterre et Hollands et encore d'autres details, que moi,
un simple "Haftling", j'ignorais.
Deja au mois de Septembre dernier, j'ai demande a NEUVIRT de me
preparer un rapport sur la Politische-Abteilung. H y etait pendant 4 ans.
Et comme tu le sais, la Politische-Abteilung, fut le meilleur poste d obser-
vation sur le crimes des SS.
Je 1'aurai en Tcheque, je le traduirai et te reserveraiune copie.
Mais, en ce qui concerne tout particulierement le cas de ces 48 officiers
des Forces Alliees, je te promets qu’en allant a Prague je me	^jjSire
en rapport avec mes amis et je te procurerai le dossier complet de cette affaire.
En ce qui concerne tout particulierement mon voyage a Prague, j'attends
toujours un avid A "Air-Franca", qui assure le traffic bi-h.Mo»adair., les
places sont prises jusqu'au 20 Decenbre et notre aviation Tcheque - faute
d’essence ne peut meme pas assurer un service hebdomadaire.﻿J'ai remarque dernierement a 1'aerodrome de Prague des arrivees
d'avions de la H-P. He pourrais-tu pas te renseigner, s*il n'y a P^ d®
temps en temps un avion de Paris pour Prague ? Bt dans ce cas, la RAF m auto
riserait-elle a prendre place a bord ?
J'aurais besoin d'etre a Prague au plus tard le 11. ou 12 courant.
Dans 1'attente du plaisir de te revoir, jete prie de meme que tes
amis, d’accepter 1'expression de mes meilleures amities.

It is known that the above-named soldier escaped from
enemy armed escort while on the line of march towards the end
of June, 1940, and was in hiding in Brussels.
A copy of a letter received from Gnr. Jones' brother is
attached, giving information of his being alive until September,
1944. The last known address of Monsieur Paul Lurquin is
"Avocat" 49 Rue de Toulouse, Brussels."
*
It is believed that the extract marked on the enclosed
copy of a statement from the Military Attache at Stockholm refers
to Gnr. Jones, as his next-of-kin's address is "20 Velindre Street
Port Talbot, Glamorganshire.
Would you, therefore, institute all possible lines of
enquiry with a view to tracing the whereabouts or fate of Gunner
Jones.

Dear Mam and Dad,
A3 I expect you know by now I have been in Brussels for three days trying
to find out something about Alf» I am no nearer finding where he is now than before
I went but at least I do know a lot that happened to him -while he was free.
I stayed at the Haeseleers the last place he stayed at before he was caught.
Before I tell you any more I think it would be better to tell you a little
about who the people were he worked with. At present you only know their names.
Mme. Colet was the woman he stayed with after he came to Brussels from
the village where he escaped. She was caught a few months before Alf.
M. Strens, his mother and brother. They are a firm of funeral directors
in Brussels. M. Strens was the leader of the party and died in Germany. His
wife and child have been living in Hastings for the last five years.
The Haeseleer family. Mother, father, son and daughter. Only the daughter
Else speaks English. Alf stayed there for the three months before he was
caught. They didn't help in the underground movement at all but gave Alf food
and shelter because they belong to the village where Alf escaped.
Paul. Lurquin. . A lawyer before the war, now a Major in the Belgian Military
Government. .1 thhk his Job now is to sort out all the evidence against Belgians
who were said to have helped Jerry.
There are a lot of others in the story but they are not important as they
only say the same as the rest.
The Germans used to bring the prisoners back through Belgium into Germany.
It was from one of these convoys Alf and two others escaped while they were in
this village. (I don't know the name). The villagers gave them civilian clothes
and must have got identity cards as well. There was a Belgian there who had been
in America for ten years. I think it must have been these Alf was speaking about
in that letter to his girl.
He must have been in this village for a time before going to Brussels. His
two mates tried to get back to England. I don't know if they succeeded or not
but nothing has been heard of them here* If they had reached England they ought to
have written to you.	. .
I dont know what Alf was doing with the underground movement but he must have
been in a few scrapes. I can't trace Mme Colet anywhere now but she has told
Paul Lurquin that if we hear nothing from Alf up to three months after VE day
she has something to tell you. She didn't say what so you will have to wait
until sometime next month to see. She was in a very bad way when she came back
from Germany and went to the Ardennes to recuperate.
It must have been after she was taken away that Alf went to the Haeseleers.
He told them a few of the things he did but not much. He used to go out from
there and didn't always go back the same day* He never told them where he had
been He had a few narrow escapes from the Gestapo. I'll have to tell you
about them as it takes too long to write them.
He was caugfrt accidertelly. He was playing cards one night at about 1 a.m.
when the Gestapo went round looking for a Jew. This Jew was one of the crowd.
They were all taken in as a precaution and it was while he was in prison they
started to find out what he had been doing.
They were nearly all caught by this time. They tried to get Alf to tell
them where he had been staying but they failed because the Haeseleers were never
bothered.
As I told you they could not speak English. Elsa couldnt speak much then so
you see must have been speaking French. V/hen he wa in St. Gilles prison he wrote
a letter in French to Elsa.
The funny part is that although he told Paul Lurquin almost everything that
went on he told him he could not speak French. (They didn't meet until they
were in St. GiUes prison.) He taught Lurquin to speak English. Lurquin must
have been a bit dumb then because he said he often wondered why Alf asked for
the newspaper and talked about the news after. Also he said that Alf knew
every horse in Belgium and worked out a system while they were together. They
couldn't bet in prison of course but on paper they averaged a 1000 francs win a
day. And it wasn't until I called there with Elsa Haeseleer that he Lurquin
learned Alf could speak French.
I don't understand Alf's reason for that neither do I understand why when
he was known as Alfred Jones at St. Gilles prison he went under a Belgian name in
Germany/﻿Germany.
Inrquin has traced Alf as far as Sept 15th 1944 but doesn’t know at what
prison he* was then.
Friday morning as I was coming away from Brussels I was told that Mme.
Strens wanted to see me. I called there and found that two people had been
there the previous day who had just got back from Germany. They said they
last saw Alf at Dachau but didn't give the data You must realise Alf had a9
rough time in prison but they said he was back in his old health then and was an
attendant at Dachau infirmary. Mme Strens is going to see them again and will
let me know the date. She also knows Edgard Perbal but didn’t know his-address.
I gave it to her so she will get in touch with him as well. They all have my
address now so perhaps they will write to me instead of to you now.
As soon as I hear anything further I will let you know. If you hear anything
let me know as well as it may help all those in Brussels a bit further.
Show this letter to Dil as it will save me writing it twice. It isn't all
the story but it was a bit difficult as I couldn’t speak French.
One thing more. Alf told Lurquin that he was in India as a miner. I didn't
tell him anything different but I thought you ought to know. As far as I can
see that is the only thing he did wrong while he was here.
Lurquin says of him that he was very intelligent -and afraid of nothing.
If you knew Lurquin you vould realise that was high praise.
All the rest thought well of him so you have nothing to worry about in that
*
Dil tells me you have had to go to bed again. I hope you are O.K. now and
b overdo it.
I think that is about all the story so if you write to the War Office again
shey will have a good lead from Dachau.
Cherrio for now and lots of love from
Lsn.
S• Alf also spoke a little German while he was in prison.

SECRET.
Subject: BRITISH PRISONERS IN CONCENTRATION CAMP.
Prom:	M.A. STOCKHOLM.	No.222	11th May 1945.
To:	D.M.I. (M.I.9)
Reference our memorandum No. 188 of the 16th April.
Since receiving the letter referred to in this memorandum we
have received a visit (on the 8th May) from a Mr. Lief JENSEN, a
Norwegian who had also been confined in Sachsenhausen camp since 1941.
2.	Mr. JENSEN confirmed the details of the seven British
prisoners as given us by Captain HOGERMANN, but added that the name
of No.1 on the list was a Lieut. R.N. Also that the name of No.3
was Keith MAYOR.
3.	According to Mr. Jensen, the normal strength of persons at
the camp was some 26,000, of whom 2,300 were Norwegians. Between
1st February and the date of the Russian final advance on Berlin
8,000 were liquidated, and we believe the figure given officially by
the Russians of liberated was 3,000 - 4,000.
4.	The British personnel as previously listed, together
with one addition - Captain John STAR or STARR, whose business address
was 160 New Bond Street, and who gave also a War Office (A.R.?)
address - were the only British in the camp.
Some months after their capture their case was investigated by
the Gestapo and they were adjudged as saboteurs. Thereafter they were
singled out for the most outrageous treatment, partly consisting of
daily 50 km. marches over varying terrain for endurance tests of
military equipment and the testing of endurance drugs. Their morale
held out superbly, with one possible exception, and they earned the
high regard of the Norwegian prisoners. The Norwegian prisoners were
allowed to work, were better treated and had their own M.O. and medical
supplies. They helped to smuggle "extras" to our men to the best of
their ability. The small British contingent were not allowed to write
or receive letters, though Mr. Jensen believes they were able to smuggle
at least one letter each out through Switzerland in the early period
of their capture.
Fran the closest cross questioning it was difficult to obtain
fran Mr. Jensen the actual fate of the 7 men on our list in memo No.188,
but on the night of the 2nd February, Nos.1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 were
assembled by the Germans in a maimer which convinced themselves and
Mr. Jensen, who was in the vicinity that they were to be shot. At the
gate an air raid warning caused a melee and there was a scrimmage which
caused sane delay and might have allowed one or more of the men to
break away. Much to his dismay No.3	not assembled with his
comrades and the above delay gave him time hastily to write the letter
(end.A, hand it to Jensen, and join the party at the gate.
5. Jensen was not an eye-witness to their fate, but he made
the following points:-
(a)	Once outside the gate the party turned to the right, which
was a sure indication that they were taken to the prison
crematorium, as the road led nowhere else.
(b)	As usual after such affairs, on the day following no one
was allowed to go near the place except the normal clearing
up squad, but Jensen found from them that the walls showed
signs of many more shot marks than the size of the party
warranted; there were also signs of a fracas and one German
N.G.O. had been wounded.
(c)	The sound of firing could be heard in the main camp﻿\
6.	Mr. Jensen has good reason to believe that Captain STARR,
captured in Prance,- who left the camp for another at MULTHADSEN on
the 15th February, was also shot.
7.	Another officer (rank unknown), Alfred JONES, of Wellindre
or Wallinder St., Port Talbot, Glam, was also shot in Multhausen.
This statement has also been made in a letter from another Norwegian.
Alfred Jones, it is alleged by both sources, was struck by a Gestapo
official in the face for insolence, the blow was returned with the
remark that "a British officer never allows himself to be struck by
anyone". The official drew a revolver and shot Jones on the spot.
There is a chance that some or all of these men may eventually
turn up, if not, you will no doubt some time receive evidence of their
fate. In any case, as far as Mr. Jensen Jpiows, No.2 on the list was
alive when the Norwegian contingent left the camp in early April.
t	_	-	...
8.	This man (Roe) suffered the worst in loss of moral fibre,
and Jensen states that he was the only one who tried in the least to
curry favour in any way. However, Jensen would not make any definite
allegations, though he did state that the question of the man's
elimination as a public danger had been debated both by the Norwegian
and British fraternities.
9.	Mr. Lief Jensen is a good type, speaks good English and is
most anxious that end. A.v should reach its destination. He is
determined, if at all possible, to visit at some future time the next
of kin of his good comrades, whom he alleges were as much killed in
action as if still combatant.
10. Unfortunately, Mr. Jensen did not know the names of any
of the German officials who were responsible for these outrages.
This, however, is not remarkable, especially in a camp of this
description.

A. G-. 3»(V.W) dated 26th July 1 %-5> concerning F 93822 cipher 15 June
from A.F.H.Q. to the War Office.
A considerable amount of correspondence has passed between
this department, the •‘•'oreign Office and the War Office (P.W.2) concerning
the fate of the "WMOEROOF" party. The War Office reference is M.0.1.(S.P)
BM/5032, and the Foreign Office correspondence which was conducted between
Lt. Colonel Perkins of this department and Mr. Dennis Allen of the Foreign
Office, whose reference is N.2656/207/0. As stated in the telegram the
investigation is being undertaken by the American authorities. For your
information I attach a copy of a minute which we wrote to P.W.2 in Februaiy
1945 giving the position as we then knew it and a copy of a statement made
to one of our officers by B.Q.M.S. ZENOPIAN, who was a member of the party.
﻿>py of m JfflPORT OF THE CAPTURE OF MAJOR SEHMER, by B.Q.M.S. ZBNOPIM
At a house three hours distance north of POLOMKA on 26th December,
1944- Major Sehmer, Lieut. Green, Lieut. Gaul, Lieut. Willis, Pte. Paulo, Ivlajor
Stauck, two other G.P.I. soldiers and sane other Americans were all gathered
together for Christmas celebrations.
I was informed of the following facts by Pte. Paulo who escaped
from the house when the Germans attacked.
At about 08.00 hrs on 26th December 1944 as everybody was dressing,
breakfast being prepared etc., they were fired upon from all directions by
many machine guns without any previous warning. Major Stauck and Pte. Paulo
were both wounded Immediately and the remainder of the Party withdrew intcjla
corner of the room. Pte. Paulo was able to jump out of a window and escape.
The Party was given ten minutes to get dressed.
Pte. Paulo from his hiding place was able to watch the G-erman
officer march the Party away under escort of HLINKA GUAKDISTS.
The complete party including Major Sehmer were correctly dressed
in Allied uniforms. A few of them were wearing Russian fur hats. The Party
was taken to Bratislava and from there to Bruck 0/D DOMU.
The attacking force consisted of 200 Germans 250 Ukrainians (of
General Vlasov's Command) and 50 Hlinka Guardists.
Pte. Paulo was a memeber of the 2nd. Czeckoslavak Parachute Brigade.
I think it is extremely possible that he has returned to his home at
MINORA I. KRIVEC 0HR. ZV0LEN. His full name is KAMENSZKY P0VJ3L and his
ape is about 24 years.
There were no civilian clothes in the house where Major Sehmer was
captured.

Missing France. 1940._______________
The above-named soldier is known to have been in hiding from the
eneray in Belgium after the capitulation of France in June, 1940, and
there is evidence which shows that he was arrested by the Gestapo and
sent to a concentration camp. The possibility is that he is identical
with the 'Freddy Jones' mentioned in your B.M.4-53/l(A.G.3.V. W.)«
Would you be good enough to arrange for Mr. Bobert Perier to be
interviewed either directly or through Lieut.Comdr. O'Leary with a
view to establishing identity of Jones. We should be glad to have
full details of the death of 'Freddy Jones, R.A.' (as Perier is said to
have witnessed both) and the physical description, apparent age,
hometown and civil occupation of Jones, with any other-information or
characteristics of the man to whan O'Leary refers. See your B.M.
quoted above.
We should be grateful if the matter could be dealt with urgently.

BAOR/15228/11/16/JAG
Dying confession made by Standartenfilhrer Ziereis, Commandant of Maut-
hausen Concentration Camp (taken down on 2Ath May, 194-5 by a Polish doctor of
medicine in an American hospital, Gusen, during the interrogation of Ziereis
by two intelligence officers, and certified correct by the doctor, - signature
illegible - of D.P. Lazarett, 397 fttr Auslfinder Linz-Niederbard, under date
26th September, 1945; translated by a school teacher).
Document supplied by Dr. Toni of the Polish D.P. Camp Cologne, Mulhein
to ADJAG, 1st Corps*1; and original passed by JAG WCS to BWCE Nuremberg, 19.11.45.
On 23rd of May, 1945, about 18 o'clock I was wounded near the cottage
of Prin, near Spital, by American soldiers while trying to escape them. My
name is Franz Ziereis, born 13th August 1905* I was commander-in-chief of
Lager Mauthausen and the other camps depending on that camp. I got shot through
the left upper arm and also in the back. The bullet went through ray body and
came out the other side. I was brought to the ^“ist (US) Evac Hospital at
Gusen, and I wish to declare as follows:
In pursuance of an order issued by Reichminister Himmler, I was required
to kill all the prisoners in accordance with instructions drawn up by Ober-
gruppenfiihrer Dr. Kalteribrunner.	The prisoners were to be put in a tunnel,
the doors of which were to be closed with stones and cement, and the whole was
to be blown up with dynamite. I refused to obey this order. I understand
that the prisoners at Lager Gusen I and II were to be liquidated by this process.
All additional details are known to Mr. Wolfram and Obersturmfilhrer Eckermann.
The latter was working in Bergeristall.
In Mauthausen camp a gas-oh&mber was built in pursuance of an order issued
by S3-Hauptsturmfiihrer Dr. Krebsbach. This chamber had been built^so as to
resemble the bath house in this camp, and prisoners were gassed in it. In
addition a special motor-vehicle, in which prisoners were also.gassed, used to
run between Mauthausen and Gusen. SS-Untersturmftthrer Wasicki, the chemist,
supplied the vehicle for this purpose. I was well aware that prisoners had﻿4 .
*
- 2 -
been gassed during the trips of the car. The gassing was carried out at the
instance of the doctor, SS'-'IIauptstvirinfllhror Dr. 3. Itrotsbach, who must now be
at Kassel. He has been eliminated from, the SS, because he had.been-a Free-
mason and had played false.. Whenever prisoners' had to be liquidated the orders
came from the Rsioh-Sicherheitshauptamt ("HSHA"), or from Himmler, Heydrioh or
Gruppenftihrer Muller ( + ) or in some cases from-Dr. Kalten-Rechner (?Kaltenbrunr.er)
chief.of the Sicherheitspolizei, (Security Police)..	"rwy- ,
* £- J I Jknow,;nothing at all about the last 800 prisoners having been killed at
Gusen II’With'sticks or stones, or by drowning. I did not give orders for them
to be killed. Furthermore, I know nothing about 640 prisoners in Y/ard Ho. 31
having been gassed at Gusen I by tho German prisoners Piegel, Amegong (since
deceased) and Liesberg, the blockmaster from bard. 1^, in pursuance of orders
by the commandant of the camp (Seidler) and Rapportfbhrer Gillemann, who had
threatened the German prisoners that if they failed to execute that order they
would never emerge alive.
I do not know the whereabouts' of Oberscharftt.hrar Jentson, who killed
about 700 prisoners in camp Gusen I by'making them Stand naked while they were
sprayed with ice-cold water, at. 12° frost, out of doors. neither do I know
the hiding place of SS-Untersturmftthrer Dr.'Nidesewetter who murdered several
hundred prisoners by intravenous'injections with gasoline, hydrogen'(40ccm),
Calciumsulphurioum 25^0, Eunaraon and Evipan.
Dr. Richter, who murdered several hundred prisoners by operating on them
without any reason, and cut away portions of the brain, stomach, spleen or
intestines, was sent by me to camp Gunzkirchen with orders to assume the
medical charge oi the prisoners in that camp.
I have, never heard that Uhters'turmftthrer Mierov, who was in pagau, shot
15 sick prisoners. ■
I am well aware that all beatings of .prisoners was forbidden by Berlin;
nevertheless, I myself have beaten them out of sheer sadism.
Obergruppenftthrer Pohl (++) gave orders that sick prisoners, who were
not entitled to get food in the camp, should be hunted into the forests where
they had to support life on fruits, berries, etc. He cut down the daily ration
of 750 grams to 350 grams per week,- and during the last 12 days we had neither
bread nor meat.
’ Gruppenftt.hrer, Gluecks (+++,) gave orders that sick prisoners were to be
certified as insane and were to be gassed. About OHE MILLION and a HALE were
murdered in this way. The gas-chamber is situated at Hartheim near Linz, in
the direction of Passau, 10 klmtrs. from Emz.
In this camp prisoners gassed in the above manner were reported as dying
from natural causes. The records of prisoners killed in this way were made
out while they were still alive or in transit; ' this was done in the adminis-
trative section of Gusen camp.
I would'like to be confronted with Himmler and Obergruppenftthrer Gluck
(?Gluecks). Pohl and Glueck must be now in the Cravezen Cottage at Sanet Lam- ,
brecht (that is about four hours up in the hills).
The gas-chamber in the Mauthausen camp was built by order of Gruppenftthrer
Glueck (?Gluecks) as he- considered that it was more humane to gas people than
to kill them by shooting.

( + ) Heinrich'Muller, head of the Gestapo office of the RSHA.

tration camps.﻿- 3 -
One day on his ovm intiative, Obergpuppenf-tihrer Pohl sent us a convoy of
6,000 women and ohildren who had all been without food for tiO days in transit.
They had been travelling by rail in open cattle-trucks, without blankets., in
icy weather in December, 1943* -By an order received from Berlin, I was required
to send the children, immediately, to Bergeft Belsen camp, and I suppose they
all died a dreadful death. I had a nervous break-down in consequence.
Another convoy.of 2,500 prisoners came from Auschwitz camp to Mauthausen;
they were ordered to be sprayed with cold water in winter on the parade ground.
I was told tn- sgnd these prisoners to Gusen camp, about 4 kins, away; we had
no clothes for them except underwear. I asked for clothes for them, but was
told in repby from Berlin that I was ho send them naked to Gusen if no olothes
were available. I sent them along in their underwear. There were several
similar incidents.
Gauleiter Eigrubber forbade the giving of food to newly arrived or sick
prisoners; he.even gave orders that 50$ of the potatoes already in stock for
the use of the camp were to;be handed over to civilians.
It was Gruppenfflhrer Glueok who gave the order that all staff who had
worked in the Mauthausen crematorium were to be sent to Gusen oajnp, where they
were to be shot, simply because some of them had already been working in ....iiuA
Auschwitz, crematorium and would have been able to give information .about these
crematoria.	‘	’
There, was a secret order that the staff of the.crematorium.were to be
liquidated every three weeks. It applied to all prisoners, without any.
exception, who worked in the crematorium. There was also an order-,to liquidate
all doctors who had been working in the hospital. I refused to comply with
this order. This order was issued by SS-Standartenffihrer Lolling (+) to all SS-
doctors, but I forbade its execution when, it was given but. Furthermore, it
was ordered that all prisoners at Mauthausen who worked in the hospital were to
be sent to other camps to be liquidated; but Dr. Ualter, who was once chief ..
medical SS officer in Mauthausen refused to obey this order. He must be at
( ? ), and I was told that he was suffering from a contagious disease.

Convoys of Jews:	In the presence of Gauleiter Rayner, Dr. Ueserrliter
(?Uiberreiter), Dr. Jury, Baldur von Schirach and others I received the followii
order from Hlmmlerl / "All Jots-, from'All-IdbaHtiesMn'-'i'the.-southTfast, v/orking
in the so-called’fbrtificatibn-coiimands. arel to be sent on foot to yaiathausen
aanm. "r .In consequence of this-order, we were'expecting to; receive. 60:,000 Jews
j.at Ifautfeasen-camp;' but in* fact' only a small fraction of this-number arrived.
1 1 remember that out of one convoy of 4,500 Jews which;, started from senevhero in
the. country, only 1.80. arrived at Mauthausen. ' The-.-women-and children ,had been
without shoes or clothes'..and were very verminous. In that convoy complete,
families had started out 'together, but an Immense, number -had.i-died.on :rthe way
from exposure,weakness etc. Ziereis asserts that, thanks to his efforts, the
Jews who were lodged in the so-called 'tent-camp’ at Mauthausen led a decent
existence and were well treated.and that there were very few deaths among them;
they were given good food and a'rest, and only then;..were they sent on to Gunz-
kirohen canp. Ziereis mentioned as a witness the Czechoslovakian prisoner
Dr. Prof. Prohaska, whom tie had frequently consulted as to how the Jewish
living conditions might be improved. (Thereupon the. prisoner Dr. Tonia stated
that, in the tent-camp alone, Jews had died 'en masse',: and that Ziereis's ■
claims to have provided them with humane treatment and .good living conditions,
were nothing but lies and boasting. In one single convoy of 5,000 Jews which
left Mauthausen for Gunzkirohen, 4 kms. away, 800 bodies- of Jews who had been
shot were counted between Mauthausen camp and the railway, bridge at Mauthausen.
Several trucks had to be ordered to remove the bodies.
Ziereis h ad 13,000 RM in one bank and 6,000 Eli in another Mauthausen
bank. He states that he'never had any gold, jewels, dollars or any other
money. Any letters he got from Himmler have been burnt, as were any orders
and photos.
The paymaster, SS-man Eisenhoffer, took all:the money way with him.
+
+
+
+
Messerschmidt factories, according to Ziereis*-s confession, paid a daily
hire of 8 RM for each prisoner to the chief administration in Oranieriburg (+),
Berlin, but the prisoner himslef got only 50 pjgs. a day. Ziereis disliked
• this practice and energetically demanded interviews with the Party leaders.
(+) That is, to the ¥VHA, under Oswald Pohl.﻿For example, he said; "I will throw the vrttole truth about all those betrayals
and murders in their faces. I was no student, I was a simple soldier and I
obtained this post thanks to my own industry-and efforts^"
BROTHEL; In Mauthausen there was a brothel; every man had to pay 2 RM,
the woman got 50 Pfgs, and the HQ of the Concentration Camps in Oraniehburg, •
Berlin got 1,50 RM. I believe (Oswald) Pohl got the moneyJ
As regards the present situation of the other members of the Camp staff,
Ziereis said;'

The head' of the.j.carrp administration, Strauss, is with his fahiily at
Helfenberg (not far from Ereystadt)', in a little house belonging to SS-Sturm-
bannfhhrer Schulpetzki. The latter, on the night of 13th March 1941 , gassed
ward No.16, which contained about 170 Russian prisoners of war, with Cyclon
gas, in compliance with an order from SS-Hauptsturmftihrer Chmielewski (+), who
later received orders to proceed to a camp in Holland, together with Dr.
Krebsbach. Chmielewski1 v/ho was often quite drunk, used to beat the prisoners
in his oanp in Holland with sticks, and shot them or drowned them in water
tanks. He was expelled from the SS because he had appropriated clothes,
money, gold, jewels and diamonds stolen from prisoners. He ordered women to
come to the officers' mess in the oarrp, beat them and abused them. ,He
directed his own "Beer-news". Later on he was sentenced to 15 years hard
labour, but the sentence was not confirmed by the Reichsfiihrer. His successor
in Holland was SS-Sturmbannfflhrer Cruenew&ld, who was sentenced to death, but
was pardoned by the SS-Reiohsffihrer, and later on reinstated as SS-Ptthrer.
He locked 40 women in an air-tight cell and let them die of suffocation. He
cannot remember the name of the camp in Holland (it was Hertogenbosch .) (++)
Obersturmftihrer Alfulisch is now a prisoner in Mauthausen; Streituieser
is staying in Coisern with SturmbannfUhrer Dr. Walter Zechner; with them.are
SS-Stabsf{Hirer Struller, Soharf-tihrer Lamm and a woman secretary from Schlier.
He does not know where SS-Oberscharfiihrer Kluge actually is; the latter s

Ziereis was arrested. Ziereis' wife may be able to divulge the hiding places
of the other men on the SS-staff. She is living with the wife of SS-Sturm-

Gusen, 24-.5*'1945*
I|y dear Tfife ,
I was found (23rd Hay 1945) 'by the Anericans vrhile you were out shopping.
I left my machine-gun behind a tree, about 4 mtrs. av/ay from the cottage, in
the direction along the river to Liesen. I ask you, my dear, to come to
Gusen v/ith the- children and call at Dr. Goschinsky's. You may be subjected
to an interview, and I ask you to tell the whole truth, that is> make a full
statement concerning the conduct of the-leaders in Berlin. Furthermore, tell
these gentlemen of our joint decision' to die so as to enable our children to
lead a better life. When I was arrested, I lost my head. I laid my machine-
gun down by the tree instead of using it, as I am known as a cradle shot. The
Americans behaved quite correctly, but they kept me covered. I had been shot
twice and I could not move. I an now in an American hospital in Gusen camp.
I have told them everything I know, so far as my condition has allowed, I
have some more details to relate, especially about the treachery of certain
gentlemen in Berlin,., including the Reichsftihrer. Please come and tell every-
body here how badly they treated us. Tell the gentlemen about the swinish
conduct of Obergruppenfiihrer Pohl.
Your loving husband,
(signed) Franz.
In regard to the dissolution of the farm in the St. Lanbreoht Command,
Ziereis made a statement as follows: the administration of this farm was in
the hands of a Standartenfilhrer from Munich, who, together with Pohl and some
women, often held noisy parties at St. Lambrecht; but the prisoners were in
their way so they decided to denounce them, alleging that they had seized the
farm and were preparing to escape. The command ’was dissolved in accordance
with an order from the Mauthausen camp leaders, and the prisoners were brought
back to the camp. Ziereis stated that he got an order- to liquidate them at
onoe on their arrival, in order that no witnesses of the doings in St. Lam—
brecht might survive. Some of these prisoners were "chased into the electric
wiring"; some were torn by Bachneyer’s dog, Lord; others were sent to Gusen
ca*.Tp for hard labour.
Execution of 38 Austrians on 29th April 1945-
Ziereis cannot state the reason for the execution of the 38 Austrians
who had already been at Mauthausen camp for more than a year. He can only
say that their execution'was carried out in compliance with, the wishes of
Gauleiter Eigruber, Dr. pfiffrater and Apann, head of the Linz Gestapo. A
certain Prochaska, a Gestapo agent, had been commissioned to oversee the
execution, which, it is said, was carried out by this man with two Blockffihrers
from Mauthausen camp. In this case, I must confess, it is true that Prochaska
and a Gestapo employee named Poacher from the Linz Gestapo were brought up to
Mauthausen in order to carry out the execution.
Statements by the Secretaries Ho.1 (panex) and No.2 (Marsalek) of Mauthausen
Camp.
"The execution which had been postponed several times was fixed for
the night of April 28th to 29th, 1945 in consequencd of pressure by Schulz,
head of the political section of Mauthausen oamp; at about 11 o'clock on
that same night, the notorious Hauptsaharfiihrer Spatzenegger and some other
Unterscharftihrers demanded the immediate production of _ the delinquents and
their execution. They were all provided with automatic machine-guns (but﻿4
- 7..
not the prisoners). . ¥e, the prisoncr-seoretaries refused to take'part in the
execution and stated that we only had orders to perform it on the following._
morning. That order came from Alfulisch, the Lagerftthrer, who really had
given us the order for the following morning. Spatzenegger and his men
strolled away, and we at once informed the Austrians of the fate which awaited
them in the morning. They tried to escape, hut owing to had luck and the
treachery of other prisoners they were unsuccessful. One man, called Diotel,
took refuge in. the hospital camp Mauthausen. Spatzenegger did not return
next, morning; the prisoners were told to report to the secretary at about
8o’clock; they were kept standing hy the kitchen until noon, and were then
conducted hy Oberscharfflhrer NiedermAyer to a courtyard where, they were
murdered hy. too Blockfihrers with automatic machine-guns. Prochaska was not
present at;,the execution.
11 One night in February 19A5, an Anglo.—American Military Mission from
Croatia, which was alleged to have been in connection with Tito, was brought
into Mauthausen Gamp. Ziereis denied that he had been present at any, inter-
rogations or tortures of the Angle-Americans. If such cruelties were
perpetrated against the Anglo-Americans it was (he said?) only by order of
Bachmeyer." Ziereis confesses that, after the interrogation^of the nnglo-
Americans, such trials came to be known in the camp as the Tibetan Prayer.y
After that (?after the interrogation) the (Anglo-American) mission was taken
to' Dachau camp in a car driven by a lieutenant from Derlin, whose nai^e J-s
unknown to him. men Ziereis, was-■.told" that what he was saying about the
Anglo-Americans was a lie, he reiterated "No, no, they drove ,away to Dachau .
According to statements by Ziereis, it-was Criminal Dommissar Hamechan, Referat
4,	8/11, Reicbssicherheitsto-i^tamt v^S.H.A.) Berlin,-.and Stantortenftihrer
Geschke, who conducted the "Tibetan'firayer", ( a term use_d_in_the prison camps
after the interrogation by torture of the Minglo-Anerican Mission).
About Heydrich, Ziereis says; All' the’Czechoslovakians murdered in
Mauthausen Camp were executed in pursuance of orders from K.H. Prank. He
himself (ziereis)'was-against such killings 'an masse'.
Ziereis states further: 'I know some details about other oanps. In
the year 1941 all the commanders of all the German concentration camps were
ordered to Sachsenhausen, Berlin, where we wore shewn, how the,Politruoks 1 sic;
and Russian Commissars were liquidated by the most rapid methods. The Russians
were collected in one.part of the ward and conducted through a ar gangway
to an execution cell, while a radio vas played loudly. Qn 8 0 er_s:L,, c
the cell there was' a hole in the wall with a mobile rest for a gun. ^ i;h
time that all the politruoks or commissars had been shot, all the Sb-PUh
of Glueck’s staff were’drunk; SS-Oberftihrer Loritz ( + ) supervised ™is
massacre. The bodies of the dead Russians were thrown outside by the bb-
Oberscharftlhrer with amazing brutality. They had eight mobile_cre^t.oria,
which were constantly in action and could dispose of between 1,500 to_2,000
bodies a day. I think that the creating •want on for at least five weeks.
When we arrived in Sachsenhausen it had alrea'dy been going on for about .
fortnight,	,	_	"i'e .	>
(+) Loritz was Commandant of Saohsenhauson Conoentration Camp.﻿- 8 -
»
In G-ross-Rosen carap the prisoners were given ^yancali-solution injections
in the cardiac veins by the SS-doctors, who were permanently changing. The
aommander was SS-Obersturnbannfti.hrer Arthur Rogel.
In Buchenwald camp I was present,-while still serving with the troops,
when Jewish prisoners were robbed of all their money, gold, and jewels.
Obersturmfiihrer Macknann and Untersturnfilhrer Meyer,' a relative of Himmler, were
notorious for this sort of plundering. Everybody in that camp acquired a big
car at once. Hackmann drove out An.a cut-away coat and top-hat, with stolen
diamonds on his fingers. The inspector of the Buchenwald arrest-cells wag
also an expert'plunderer, and drove out drunk, with a naked woman in the car,
to Erfurt, where he spent 5>000 a night in the bars - of course he paid with
stolen money*	.	.	'
4*	+	+	+
If I remember rightly, OberscharfiAhrer Hirsoh, the officer in charge
of the arrest-cells was shot because he could not escape, Sturmbannffi.hrer
Eoch is said to have advised him personally to commit suicide. Hirsch knew/
all about commander Koch. Koch was syphylitic and got treatment from a pri-
soner- doctor, whom he later murdered with the help of an SS-doctor. A big
deal was arranged with the Jewish plunder; a blanket worth about 2,50 RM, was
sold at 100 RM.
An SS-doctor, Sturmbannftlhrer. Dr. Kirohner, a psychiatrist, killed a
great.;number of prisoners whom he certified as insane. This action - as was
the case in other camps also - was officially stated, in the reports made under
No.14'F 13, to have been taken in order to prevent biological disease. The
prisoners from Dachau, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen were sent before, a commission
from Berlin, presided ober by SS-Hauptsturmfilhrer Dr. Lonauer, who had a clinic
at Linz^ - Hartheim. They .were declared to be mentally defective; I believe
that, with an average of 20,000, 2 million prisoners a year must have been
gagged In that gas-chamber of. Br. Lonauer’s nr. Linz, As Mauthausen’s, the
gas-chamber looked exactly.like a bath-house. The actual execution was not
in the hands of the S3.'-Dr. Lona'uer "and-Dr. ReynAud, but of other offioers.
I do not remember the name of the head of the police - he was killed later on
in Croatia. They were gassed with doaloxyd-gas. The ashes were piled up
behind the doctor’s clinic, and were afterwards loaded on to trucks and duijped
in the Danube, It is said that Hitler himself gave the orders'to stop this.
His reason was that information might reach the relatives of the deceased?
(letters of condolence), people occasionally got the ashes of their dead.
At Auschwitz camp the ReichsfWhrer’s Commissioner stole 40kgs* of tooth-?
gold; I do not remember the man’s name, but I'dm sure that G-lueoks must know
him. In all the qamps the hair, of the men, t-romen- and children was cut and
shaved; this hair was used to make shoes for the winter-equipment of the army.
In order to prevent any waste of hair, men had only a narrow .strip,, just the
width of the clippers, cut in their hair. (+)
Heydrich (since killed) gave orders that all the faces of the prisoners
v/ere to be marked v/ith invisible (?indelible) ink, from the top of the fore-
head to the nose and across the oheeks. This tattoo stayed on for. 3 months
and then had to be reneYred. G-luecks and Hosch (?Hoess) gave orders, while
■they were commandants- of Auschwitz camp,' that the prisoners' numbers Y/ere to
be tattooodon their arms. Mauthausen tattooes \/ere scarce.
(+) This Yjas done by an order from the TOKA to render prisoners conspicuous
•	and thus make escape japre difficult.﻿In Mauthausen there rj&s a gas-charaher which had "been converted fron a
hath-chanber, or vice-versa^ next door to the crematorium. According to
Ziereis' confession only executions took place in this room.- (That is not
true: this is a remark of Dr. Toni's).	.
Ziereis'denies that he gave orders that prisoners in Gusen Gamp were to
stand naked in winter outside the wards until they fell dead. When he heard
about this order, he -forbade it immediately and told Glueck what he had done,
.who called him a Schelsskerl.
In the year 194-2/4-3- ^ ,000 Dutch Jews were brought to Mauthausen. On
,3-1st May 194-3, Himmler was there and gave orders that the Jews were to'carry
heavy stones weighing more than' 50kgs, of granite on their shoulders. These
stones had to be brought up some steep steps to build up the road near Wiener
Graben. The Jews, nearly all committed suicide by jumping down from the wall
which was about 50 mtrs. high. Shortly after Himmler’s visit Ziereis told
Gluecks of the order, and asked him to stop it, because he knew that civilians
could.see what was being done. , In reply he was told that nobody should demur
■at an order which■■ came from the.’Reichsfiihref himself. Three months later,
about 1,000 Czechoslovakian Jews arrived. At that tine the mortality was only
3$. The high officials in Berlin thought this was not enough and Lipperihen-
schel (Liebehensohel?) rang up Ziereis and asked him what was happening and
why he did not get more prisoners killed, Ziereis says that he replied that
he wanted all the men for labour.
From that time on Ziereis was treated as unreliable, and regarded with,
suspicion. He got.one degradation after another - or so he says (yet he was
promoted from Sturmbannffihrer to Standartenfiihrer) J
Concerning the "prominent".prisoners Ziereis made the following state-
ment:
Horthy’s son lived in this camp under the name of "mouse"'; Badaglio
under the name of Breusewetter; and Gorte under his real name. An order
was received frorrj Gauleiter Eigruber that they were all to be liquidated; but
after an interview with Colonel Hupper I refused to obey this order. I sent
them to Dachau, except Corte-, who was put in. the cell-ward. The doors of the
cell were always unlocked and he got SS rations.
Ziereis said, that, to the best of his belief, in the area Warsaw -
Kowno' - Riga — Libau, about i.O million people, were murdered.

Camp Hospital.)
Record of statements taken from SS-Standartenfiihrer Frans Ziereis,
former commandant of the Concentration Camps Mauthausen - Gusen - Linz etn.
I, Franz Ziereis wag born 13«7.'1905 in Munich. My Father was killed
in the first world war; my Mother is living, in Munich.
I have one brother Rudolf who is 38 years old, a steam engine machinist,
and two sisters Margarets 47 years old and Wilhelmine 32 years old. I am a
merchant by profession. During my long unemployment I worked as a carpenter.
I performed my military service from 1,4.24 to 30.9*36, in a Bavarian
Regiment, in which I held the rank of Sergeant. I le'ft the Army with the
rank of Lieutenant, and I came to the SSon August 3Cth 1936 with the rank of
Obersturmflihrer and I was assigned to. the 4th Stan&arts ,SS- in ..Oranienburg as-
a teacher, for schooling the--men.﻿9

proportion, of SS trocps-' to the nuiaher of prisoners was 1 to 10.

The. greatest number of'prisoners in the camp at Mauthausen was 17,000

: caiaps. j, excluding Mauthausen, was 76,000 prisoners,’and the total came to
95,000„' The number of deaths vas over 65,000. The number of SS troops waa
about .5,000} they wore called "Totenkopfverbande" (Deaths - Head - Units).
They wore divided /. y sections of guards and command-staff. The rest of the
SS (.over ( ,000 m-i!') came from the Air Force (Luftwaffe); they were dressed in
SS uniforms , and many of them were so called "Volks.deutscher"
Prisoners of Germaji nationality - in all about 4-50 men - were also
issigned to the S3' tincpm under orders given by Himmler. These prisoners
might'be required to light against the enemy, especially against the Russians.
They were mostly vpluntcore;. the rest were conscripted by the commanders with-
out my knowledgew ,.
Orders to burn all. the prisoners’ documents were given in the last days
of April (154.5') and in the first days of May; the order was issued by the
Office D '(•++); in Berlin by iroupleader SS Gluecks, The order to kill the
prisoners was' given given by SS.Reichsftthrer Himmler. During his visit to
Mauthausen, HLuitm hersogf gave orders that the prisoners were to be made to
carry big sponos i -’j - 50 kg, each, as an example of how they might be liquidated.
Personally T '; • o murdered many hundreds of prisoners, perhaps about 400
by consigning them ;o ice penal company, (Strafkompanie) where many were tor-
tured, and kalledeevery night, according to. orders from Berlin, I have perso-
nally .po.r+icipa fed in the executions.
In 1540, 320 paler; from Warsaw were massacred by orders received, from
Grupponfilhrer- Mayericirn	On several occasions I had- to shoot' at prisoners
because the new SS''treeos ('volksdeutsche) shot .so badly with small arms. The
order that they were to be shot with small arms came from Gruppenfflhrer Gluecks.
A_ shpoting-qtand was'insiallec the camp at Saohsenhausen, by his orders, where
the prisoners jeac shot vithouu warning from behind (Genidksohuss), while a
radio loud-speaker blared out.
According to orders,issued by Hauptsturmffihrer .Lonauer and Dr. Renault
" incorrigible'-brininals' .of profession" were certified "insane" and sent- to
Hartheim near Lins, where they'were annihilated by a-special process of Dr.

the first Canp G-usen conraandant, had murdered several thousand prisoners. I
am not responsible for this, because the orders were given by Berlin. I was
not a shareholder of Best, and I only received 300 marks monthly from Best and
600 narks monthly in return for certain duties as a camp leader, I had no
other income, .Hunting did not cost me anything, as it was allowed to me free
of charge. The plane did not cost me anything because it was given to me.
Furthermore,, I received orders to kill all the prisoners at G-usen I and II by
blowing up the vaults (Kellerbau) at a tine when the prisoners would be in
then, in case the Russian Army should advance into the neighbourhood. If the
USA. Army were to come first the prisoners were to be set free. In February
194-5 SS Gruppenfiihrer Pohl had given instructions that the prisoners were to
be led into the woods where they were to be murdered in different ways, by
certain means; this was also to be done if the war was lost. My wife was
shocked, and exerted her influence on me so that I began to ignore Berlin. I
had recognised that the orders from Berlin were senseless, but it made me
nervous. Mauthausen - Gusen were the last camps to which the camps at Buchen-
wald, Bachau, Auschwitz etc. were finally evacuated. Thousands of prisoners
were sent to us unexpectedly, men, women and children - and there was no food
for then. I asked Berlin to stop this cruelty and they, my superiors,
criticised me. In every convoy there were 600 - 800 dead prisoners.	Shortly
before the end of the war they sent us a convoy of 4->800 prisoners from Dachau,
and only 180 of them arrived, the others had died from starvation on the way,
because they had been given no food. In the last days, just before the end
of the war, the crematorium crews at Mauthausen and Gusen were murdered by
SS-Hauptsturmflihrer Bachmeyer because they knew too much. Continuing his
statements Ziereis mentioned many names of high SS officials, among them
Eigruber, the Gauleiter of Upper Austria. When I met Himmler for the last
time, he said, it was in Vienna, 7-8 weeks ago. I believe that he is hiding
somewhere in Czechoslovakia. In reply to my question as to whether he realised
that the war was lost for Germany, he said-"Yes", Now I. realise y/hat a disaster
has been brought on 80 million Germans by one stupid man, Hitler, and the results.
At this point the interrogation came to an end because of Ziereis1 weak-
ness and his difficulty in speaking. Frana Ziereis made the above statements
as he lay in bed, having been seriously wounded by two shots, one in the
stomach and one in the left shoulder.
- All■the questions asked him in German by_ two Intelligence agents he
answered consciously and without'any 'compulsion.

Invitation to the Commission from the United
States military authorities to send, official
observers to Dachau for the trial of
approximately sixty major perpetrators in the
Mauthausen concentration camp.
"London, March 12th, 1946.
Dear Lord Wright:
I have been asked by the United States military authorities
in Germany to convey to the United Nations War Crimes Commission
an invitation to send one or two official observers to Dachau,
Germany, to be present throughout the course of the trial of
approximately sixty major perpetrators in the Mauthausen
Concentration Camp who are charged with murder and other mistreat-
ment of civilian nationals and members of the armed forces of
nations then at war with Germany. This trial, which will be held
before■a general military government court convened by the
Commanding General of the Third United States Army, is scheduled
to begin on or about March 28, 1946.
I will be obliged if this invitation is brought to the
attention of the Commission at an early date. In the event of its
acceptance, Headquarters, Third United States Army, APO 4C3, U. S.
Army, should be advised as soon as possible and not less than
three days prior to arrival, of the date each observer may be
expected to arrive and the probable duration of his stay so that
appropriate accommodations may be assured.
Each of the seven governments having War Crimes Liaison
Detachments at the War Crimes ..ranch, United States Forces,
European Theater, has been invited through such detachments to
se'ixd’one'_or"twb'W)bservers~fd^aftehd the Mauthausen trial. Like
invitations are also being extended to five other governments
not represented by detachments at the War Crimes Branch.

MAUTHAUSKH Concontratiqn
1.	I have recently received a request to obtain affidavits from two
British officers who were inmates of fiAUTHAUS&N Concentration CEump and rtho
vj©r® thought to be in a position to give useful evidence about war crimes
committed there. This request was transmitted to me through Lieutenant-
colonel H.H. >t de of tiie Onitud , ations #ar Crimes Comission who has
recently been visiting DACHAU. The two officers mentioned are Captain
John Starr and Flight-Lieutenant Anthony S ears of the Royal fir Force and
I understand that their names were mentioned by the witness Caaaander Taylor.
2.	The iosition is as follO’,,s. The identity of Captain ir rr is knom
to me since this Office has had occasion to obt in evidence from him
relating to other matters but v/e had not taken a detailed at teraent from him
About MAUTHAUSEN Concentration Ccsaj). I have therefore obt ined ttso further
affidavits from this witness in vhich he sets out all that he knows about
MAUTHAUSEN. You will observe th t he w.s there from Janu. ry to April 1945
and o n speak generally to war crimes committed in the camp. Ho cannot,
however, identify any of the persons responsible except HauntstonafAhrer
BACHMAYER who is not one of the accused mentioned in the charge sheet a oo-iy
of which was transiaitted to me. Y u will Iso note th t tSiis witness st tea
th t he had no oaiortunity to get to know the n -ass of the camp staff but that
he might well be able to identify some of the® if he saw them. Captain
Starr is still in the Army and is willing and jaixious to be of any further
ssistunoe* If, therefore, you should wish for him to attend at the trial
I will make the necessary arrangements through the appropr;. te branch of the
iirr Office (a.G.3 (¥«} ) if you will, signal to mo indicating your wishes
and giving any ne'cess ry directions. In the meantime I forward the original
and ten copies of each of the affidavits made by Captain Starr.
3.	*ith regiird to Flight-Lieutenant Anthony Spears, the Royal Air Force
have made extensive searches and have now informed me that there h a been no
officer of that name in toe Royal Air Force and further to t no R.A.F.
officer bearing a sioil r name has been a prisoner of war in MAUTHAUSEN.
Captain Starr was therefore questioned about Flifht-LieutenaBt Anthony Spears
and he st--ted that virile he was in MAUTHAUSEN he knew a man-who passed under
that name. Although Spears spoke excellent Inglish C rtain Starr very aeon
formed the Impression to t he was a German ’'stool-pigeon* who was wording v
under that name. In these circumstances I have not been able to carry the
inquiries about this person any further but hope that this information will
be of ssistance.

I, No. 230430 Captain John Ashford Rensh&w STARE, Cenerftl list, with
permanent home address at 31, Eleanor Orescent, Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire, make oath and say as follows
1.	I was taken prisoner at DIJON or. 10 July, 1943, dressed in civilian
clothes. I had been organising a French Resistance Movement in the Jura
area of France. Between July 1943 and January 1945 I passed through several
prisons aid concentration camps and ultimately in January 1945 I found
myself at MAUTHAUSEN Concentration Camp, I remained there until the end
of April 1945.
2.	MAUTHAUSEN was not so much a concentration camp as an extermination
oamo. It was indeed called by the 'Jeiaana themselves there ’ VERNICHTNUNGS-
LAGER\ meaning *EXTEHtilNATION CAMP’. The words 'DU KCMHST NIEMALS RAUS\
meaning 'YOU WILL NEVER COME OUT*, were engraved in stone above the prison
gate.
3.	During my time there, there were perhaps some 45,000 inmates.
The®© consisted of every conceivable nationality including German criminals-.
These Gorman criminals were put in charge of the 30 blocks housing the
imaatee. These German criminal, guard© had the right of life or death over
the iranatea. The majority of the people in MAUTHAUSEN had previously been
in other concentration camps and had been taken to MAUTHAUSEN with the
object of working or starving them to death. The death roll was roughly
500 a day. Of these some 250 might have died from starvation, dysentery,
and other illnesses, and the balance met their death in a variety of ways,
such as being gassed, beaten to death, thrown over a stone quarry, chewed
up by hungry dogs, hanged, shot, and aO'Oti. ’Eh® dead bodies ware then
consumed in an incinerator. During my time there the inmates were forced
to build a second incinerator. Even these two incinerators were insufficient
to consume the dead remains, although they were working night and day, and.
accordingly a huge pit was dug by inmates into which dead bodies were thrown.
4.	On a party arriving at MAUTHAUSEN Oamp those who were ill were lined
up aesparately and made to undress. At the time I arrived at the camp it
was very cold and the sick people were kept in a complete state of nudity
for- the whole day. Towards the evening these sick people were forced by
brutal beatings of truncheons into the .shower baths where they were ma&o to
take a hot shower. After that they were forced, in the same brutal way,
out into the open again and kept there until well into the night, still
without any clothe® or any means of drying themselves. In the early hours
of the morning they were thrust into the showers again and then made to take
a cold shower which lasted for about half an hour. They were then again
brutally urged out into the open. M&qy subjected to this treatment
collapsed and died. Others would die from the beatings they received wnxle
being forced in and out of the shower®. Persons who did not declare them-
selvos to be ill were paraded before tin* camp doctor who marked them on the
ohesv or back with indelible pencil. Those who appeared to the doctor to
/be reasonably.,.﻿

not, were marked with the letters 'EL' on the back. Those marked 'KL' were
put through the hot and co^ phsiairB/ln the way I have described and beaten
up all through the nlght and those^o ware iiot dead1 by the morning were
frequently finished, ;ol^ iwith firt	I ityaelf have seen these incidents

5» There was at HADTHABSER a gas oha aber. Every day a party of imatea
varying between 100 and 200 were marched into the gas chamber and exterminated.
6. It is impossible to exaggerate tb.3 sadistic brutalities of the SS guards.
For no reason at all inmates of the camp, already in a deplorable physical
condition would be picked upon and beats i or otherwise done to death.

7° I recall on one oocasion that th( whole camp was paraded and the
commandant passed through the lines feel :.ng the arms of the inmates. Those
who appeared to him to be sufficiently v: ;rong were set aside for working
parties, but those whom he decided from .he thinness of their arms to be of
insufficient strength, were set aside ic be liquidated,,

8.	I have myself seen inmates beatei: to death. One such incident
occurred in the hut in which I was lodge L One of the inmates, a Jew,
web suspected to have spoken to other Je m against the harsh treatment.
This came to the ears of the Block Chief who in the presence of th© other
inmates, beat this Jew to death.

9.	The camp was divided into 3 sub-c raps, 1, 2 and 3, I wa® in No, 3
Camp and housed in one of 5 huts. The;. - were about 1,500 in No, 3 Gasp in
all. Every night the German criminals ut over ua thrashed uo with thongs
to mak© us huddle together more closely o provide sufficient room for uo
all to lie down. About March 1946 No.	Camp w&e evacuated and some 1,000
other inmates, all sick to the point of eath, were moved in to the 5 hum.
Every conceivable article was moved out, such as blankets, palliasses and
feeding bowls, until absolutely nothing amained. The camp waa then locked
up and the 1,000 sink inmates abandoned o perish from hunger. The only
time that ths gates were opened was to c ilect the dead. I myself have
seen inmates who were no mor© than anime ed skeleton;;: fighting with each
other to obtain a blade of grass to eat.
10.	Every conceivable form of brutal1 y was practised by the guards and
incidenta were es numerous that it is dl fieult for ms to select any one
worse than another. Cannibalism was p? ctiaed. On one occasion a horse
was killed and I myself saw inmates com- md the raw entrails.
11a The damp me staffed by German S£ I do not know, the names of any
of these} I never had an opportunity of learning such names. I believej
however, that the name of the commandant was Hauptaturmfuhrer MCtE&YBR.
Although I do not know any names, it la ot unlikely that I might be able
to recognise some of them if I were to s o them.

1. Further to my affidavit in the matter of Mauthausen concentration camp, of even
date,, While I was an inmate of Mauthausen, T. was told by some other inmates that it
had been a practice at the camp to liquidate recaptured prisoners of war. 1 was told that
American and British prisoners of war who had escaped, had onb«Lig recaptured, been brought,
to Mauthausen where they were killedo A common method of killing these recaptured
prisoners of war was to make them run up some 80 steps from a quarry, carrying on be_r
shoulders a large and heavy piece of stone and when the prisoners fell exhausted, -he
S„S, guards used sledge hammers to break the stones on the baoks of the prisoners s^'
killed them. I was told that some 45 American and BritiA;prisoners of war were killed
by this means0
20 Other methods used to kill inmates were the injection of petrol into their veins,
apH the use of a devioe resembling a height measuring stand whioh, when the top pxece
was brought to the level of the head of the person being measured, a bullet was
automatically fired into the baok of the neck.

FCEM 3JA — WO 6a.
Before me, Patricia M. Keegan, being authorized to administer oaths,
personally appe rs Dr. Hans T ost who, being by rne first duly' sworn in
GEIIIAH, made and subscribed the following statement in his own handwriting:
Typing this myself, I make the following statement: I was employed in
Amt VT but loaned out to Amt IV (Gestapo) for four days to do some inte^ceting.
On January 10th or'about that time of the year 1945 I was for four days interpreter
in the GO Mauthausen for the interrogation of an Allied Commission of officers, who
came to Slovakia from Italy by plane to give advi.ce to the Slowakian partisans.
I was interpreting for the Gestapo-Oberkriminal sekretar HABECKER, who had to
interrogate the British members of that team.
The first prisoner brought before us was a tall dark haired man who called
himself Sergeant Jilson from Elgin (Scotland). During the interrogation the
Gestapo-man Habecter had doubts as to.the identity of Wilson because of the way
ffilson pronouned the word "London". He asked me whether my impression was that
was Scottish and I asked Wilson to write down a few’ lines in English so that I
could check, his handwriting. As Wilson had written a few lines, I said I was not
sure because of the letter he wrote were some typically English and some typically
German type of handwriting. I told Habecker that I would advise him to telephone
to Berlin to a certain Scotsmai (who was on the German side and whose mother is
German) to come ove to Mauthausen and tee the prisoner . But Habecker said
something about having a shorter nay of doing things and took the prisoner out of
the interrogation room. After a couple of minutes I heard cries from across the
corridor and I went in the direction of these cries. In a room I found the prisoner
hanging from his writs. As soon as I opened that door I was met by Habecker w?ho
told rne to get out and go back into my .quarters, as he did not need me any
more because the prisoner is a Vienna Jew who speaks German all right. I objected
to that torture and said rather excitedly, "I want to telephone to Berlin to get
that Scotsmand over here and to complain about this type of interrogating prisoners".
Habecker should, "Get out of here.*" He closed the door and I went back into
my room (outside the GO proper) and lay on my bed, rather very excited because I
never had seen such a thing before.
I do not know whether it was the next day or the afternoon of the same day
I came again to the "Bunker" for interpreting and Hab'ecker told me that Sergeant
Wilson, had confessed that he was Warndorfer from Vienna and that he did not belong
to the Anglo-American Officers mission but baled at night out of an RAF plane over
Vienna to do Intelligence work there. But he had baled out by far too much east of
Vienna and landed' somewhere in Slowakia.. He wireless operator dad not bale out at
all. After being caught by the partisans he was gitren over to this American-
British Commission for interrogation. With this commission he was caught by the
Germans and brought to Mauthausen. Warndorfer had overalls and was the only
prisoner without badges or uniform.
After Warndorfer had confessed Habecker was quite friendly to him, especially
as Tamdorfer gave him all the secrets to the key of the Chiffre (code) which he
ought to hdve used in Vienna . Habecker boasted that the Gestapo would get into
wireless communication with the men on the other side of Wamdorfer’s job. I
nyself talced with Warndorfer later about the conditions (food situation, political
movement, etc.) in England. Wamdorfer looked well though in fear. He'wrists were
stiff from hanging. I left Mauthaused again-on Friday night (about 12th of
January 1945).
I came back to Berlin Sunday (13th January"?) morning and had to go back to
our camp near Kolpin where the Intelligence Service (Amt VI) was quartered. As the
telephones were const.- ntly out of order in Berlin because of air raids I never heard
anything more about the prisoners in Mauthausen.

Thost	who, being by me first duly swbrrl 'In "
O'S" -made and su’oscri'bb’d the following statement In his own
handwriting*
fyplng this myself, I make the following statement; I was em-
ployed in Amt VI but loaned out to Amt IV (Gestapo) for four days
to do soma interpreting. On January 10th or about that time of the
year 1945 I was for four days infer©preter in the C.C. Mauthausen
for the interrogation of an Allied Commission of officers, who came
to Slowakia from Italy by plan© to give advice to the Slowakian
partisans. I was interpreting for the Gestapo-Oberkrlminal sekretar
HABECKEH, who Imd to interrogate the British mem ers of that team.
Eio first prisoner brought jefore us was a small dark haired
man who called himself Sergeant Wilson from Elgin (Scotland.)
During the interrogation the Gestapo-..an Kahooker had doubts as
to the identity of Wilson because of the way Wilson pronounced the
word “London.” He asked mo whether my impression was that Wilson
was Scottish and I asked Wilson to write down a few linos in English
so that could check his handwriting. As Wilson had written a few
lines, I said I was not sure because of the letters he wrote were g&me
typically English and some typically'German type of handwriting.
1 told aoecker that I would advise hit? to telephone to Berlin to a
certain Scotsman (who was on the German side and whose mother is
German) to come ova;.- to Mauthausen and see the prisoner. But
Habecksr sa.d something about having a shorter way of doing things
and took the prisoner out or the interrogation room. After a
couple of minutes i heard cries from across the corridor and I
went in the direction of these cries. In a room I found the prisoner
hanging rrom his wrists. As soon as I opened that door I war mat
by Habacker who told me to get out and go back into ay quarters,
as he did not need me any more.because the prisoner is a Vienna
Jew who speaks Gorman all right. I objected to that torture and
said rather excitedly, "I want to telephone to Berlin to yet
that Scotsman over hero and to complain about this type of intor-
rogating prisoners." Habeoker shouted, "Get out of hare I" He
closed tho door and I went back into my room (outside the C,G.
proper) an. lay on my bed, rather very exalted because 1 never
had seen such a thing before.
I do not know whether it was the next day or the afternoon of
the sa .o day I cane again to the "Bunker" for Interpreting and
Habeckor told me that Sergeant . :laon Imd confessed that he was
arndorfer from Vienna and that ho did not belong to the Anglo-
American Off".cars mis ion but baled at night out of an sAF plane
over Vienna to do Intelligence-w rk there• But he had baled
out by far too much east of Vienna and landed somewhere in Slo-
wakia. If.s wireless-operator did not bale out at all. After
being caught by the partisans he was Ivan over to this Amer.lcan-
British Commission for interrogation* With this commission he was
caught by tho Germans and brought to Mauthausen. Warndorfer had
overalls and was the only prisoner without badges or uniform*
After a. uderfer had confessed liabeeker was quite friendlj to
him, especially as Warndorfer gave hi all the secrets to the key
of the Ghiffre (code) which he ought to have used in Vienna. Habeoker
boas tod that the Gestapo would get into wireless communication with
the men on the other side of Warndorfer’s job. I myself talked with
r.arndorfer taper about conditions {food-situation, political move-
ments, etc.,) in England, v,arndorfer looked well though in fear.
His wrists were stiff from vhat hang ng. I left Mauthausen again bn
Frida; n lit (about 12th of January 1945.)﻿Page Two
I caxaa back to Berlin Sunday (13th January?) morning and ad
to go back to our camp near Kolpia where the Intelligence Sendee (Mit
VI) ’•> quartered. As the telephones were constantly out of order
in 3e*xin because of air raids 1 never heard anything more about
the prisonero in Mauthausen.
A forthnight later (2nd of February) I started with the British
Major Dodge mission.

1,t’	•	Dr Hand'THOST1was interrogated at FWE 29 by this Detachment and
the deposition is attached herewith for your information.
2.	' The chief perpetrator appears to be a Gestapo Oberkrlminalsskretaer
. HABECKER, who answers to the description of a Walter HABECKER, Krim. Koiam. Amt.
12 R.S.H.A., held in your custody in G.3.D.I.S. (W.E.A.) (see letter addressed .
to you from HQ Intelligence Div, 70 KQ C.C.G. B.A.O.R., undated, but I imagine
* of sometime at the and of August 1946)
3.	The interrogation of HABECKER might possibly; tie up with'the murder
of Intelligence Corps Personnel, and give a lead to the ultimate fate of the
British personnel concerned.
4.	In a conversation, after interrogation, Dr THOST revealed the following
information which, although it may be of no value to War Crimes, may be of interest
to Security or Intelligence. First, he worked in AMT VI (England Abteilung) in
Berlin, and had charge of the correllation of all intelligence gleaned from different
sources, English newspapers (obtained from Portugal and Sweden), telephone conversations
between London and Washington, radio conversations, censored mail etc., and inside
information on the political and economic conditions in England. Thesekh® passed to
German Secret Service, Gestapo and Luftwaffe. An example of his -work is given
Advertisements and gossip columns of local newspapers were carefully watched, and
indications of new padres or extra doctors being brought into the area was taken
as an indication of a movement of people into that area. This was checked on the
ground if sighs of a War Potential ms revealled, the information was passed
to the Luftwaffe for action. ^
5„	it is interesting to note that after Sgt Wilson - Wamdorfer had been
tortured Into submission by HABECKER, Dr THOST should question him on,the very
conditions in England it ms his duty to obtain in ACT VT.
5.	i find it hard to belive that the Gestapo were so short of interpreters
that they had to bring a man of Dr THOST's high position in AMT VI from BERLIN to
Austria to act simply as Interpreter.
7.	Secondly he drew attention to having been th® friend and of having lived
in Germany with a Major John B. Dodge, Ferring on Sea, Sussex, phone number :
Goring 25, who was mysteriously freed by th® Nazis in October 1944 in BERLIN. THOST
claims that it was his intention to take Dodge to England via Switzerland, The
•ourposs ms supposedly in the nature of preventing the Russians from coming further
West. It ms to*have been of a political nature, but whether it was for political
of intelligence I do not know.,
8.	THOST has a sister in BERLIN who is supposed to be in possession of th®
facts of the whol® story. She is ! Frau Hela WULFING VON MARTITZ, FALTEHWSG 23,
GRTJNEfALD, BERLIN. According to THOST, Dodge ms released in February 1945 and they •
lived in various parts of Germany, until Dodge ms granted entry into Switzerland﻿-2-
by the Swiss authorities in April 25th 1945* Dodge was passed over the Swiss
frontier by TPIOST. Dodge is supposed to have corresponded with DHOST's sister
in BERLIN.
9.	THOST himself, vdshesto b@ brought into British custody and then
released to Hamburg. Ha appears terribly afraid to have to go to Berlin. I think h®
has more connection with the BERLIN G-estapo and the SEHMER-T/AENDOHEER Case than
appears on the surface.
10.	Another man cohnected with the Intelligence Corps Casa was Sturm-
bannfuehror Dr SCHOENSEIPEN, Chief Interpreter (Cestapo Major) Cologne. He is
described as having a strong Rhineland accent, ag@ 35~38, dark, thick wavy hair,
previously in the (Gestapo in CBMNITZ and DANZIG. SCH0EHEN3EIPEN could have stopped
the torture of the men but ha ms.de no effort to do so. He ms later seen with the
badges and insignia of th® murdered men, and he remarked that he wanted thsm as
souveniers.
11*	I will fraaz® Br Hans THOST pending your reply and will cause a
search to be mad® regarding the members mentioned in th© deposition and conversation.
12.	Any additional information, or the result of your enquiry would be
appreciated by this office.

Deposition on oath of Doc Hans THOST, male of PWE 29,
Dachau, sworn before me, Capt. J.M. RATCLIFFE l/7 Middsex Regt.
British Liaison Staff, War Crimes Cp., U.S. Army, at Dachau
26 November 1946.
I am Doc Hans THOST, born 19 April 1899 at Hannover,
Militaerstr. 18, novelist, of German nationality. I was a member
of the Party (NSDAP), No. 140611, from July 1929 to January 1944.
I was a civil servant in the Main Office for the Security of the
Reich VI (England Section). It was my duty to distribute to the
various departments the translations from the English newspapers
and the telephone conversations between London and Washington.
On 8 January 1945 I was loaned to the Gestapo in Multhausen for
translations, and it was in this camp that I met the English
prisoners for the first time. I worked for four days as an inter-
preter, for Chief Gestapo Secretary (Gestapo-Oberkriminalsekretar)
HABECKER, who conducted the interrogation of the English pri-
soners .
The first prisoner who was brought before us was a large
man, dark hair, who said he was Sergeant WILSON of Elgin (Scot-
land) .
During the interrogation HABECKER doubted that WILSON was
an Englishman, because he pronounced the word "London" in a
funny manner. HABECKER asked my opinion and I suggested that
WILSON should write down a few sentences in English. After
WILSON had written something, I noticed that some of the letters
were typically English, but some were typically German. I
suggested to HABECKER that he call Berlin hnd ask for a Scots-
man (who was working for Germany and whose mother was German)
and to have him come to Matthausen (Multhausen?) and speak to
WILSON. HABECKER replied that he had a much shorter method and
took him out of the room. After a few minutes I heard a scream
from the other room and I went in that direction. When I entered
1﻿the room I saw the- prisoner hanging by his hands. Immediately
QP I opened the door HABECKER told me'to return to my room and
he did not need me any longer, because the prisoner was a
Viennese Jew and spoke good German. I was indignant at this
torturing and said excitedly that. I was going to have the Scots-
man come from Berlin and that I would complain about this method
of interrogation. Whereupon he screamed: "Get out of here!"
I returned to my room (outside of the concentration camp) and
lay down on my bed', I was very upset as I had never seen anything
like this before.
I cannot remember exactly, if it was the next day, or the
same day in the afternoon when I returned to the "Bunker".
HABECKER then told me that Sergeant WILSON had admitted that he
was WARNDORFER of Vienna and that he was not a member of the
English-American officers' mission, but that he had bailed out
from an RAF airplane over Vienna to act as a spy and had landed
alone a little too far away in Slovakia. After he had be/3n
captured by the Partisans, they had taken him to the British-
American Commission for questioning. He was taken prisoner by
the Germans along with this Commission and was brought to Maut-
hausen. He was wearing overalls and was the only prisoner without
an insignia or a regular uniform.
After WARNDORFER's confession, HABECKER acted very friendly,
towards him, as.WARNDORFER had given him the secret key to the
cipher code, which he was supposed to use in Vienna. HABECKER
boasted that he would get in touch via radio with the other co-
workers of WARNDORFER.
I personally spoke with WARNDORFER about the conditions in
England (food situation and political situation, etc.). WARNDORFER
looked well, but scared. His wrists were still stiff from the
hanging.
Ihe next day I was present at the interrogation of Major
SEHMER.
The next day I was present at the interrogation of Major
SEHMER, who was a British officer and leader of the British Mission
to the Partisans in Slovakia. Present at the interrogation were
Otto HABECKER, Chief Criminal Commissioner (Qberkriminalkommissar),
ZIEREIS who (was) the leader of the concentration camp in
- 2 -﻿Mauthausen, ALl’FULDISCH, 1st Lt (Obersturmfuhrer), and I as
^interpreter. Major SEHMER was brought in, he was wearing a
-
complete uniform and all insignia of rank. He answered all
questions quietly and politely, but he could not remember small
details about his superior officers in Italy. Then the bruta-
lities started by ZIEREIS slapping Major SEHMER in the' face.
HABECKER took Major SEHMER into the next room and hung him by
the wrists to a three cornered implement which was there for
that purpose. I heard screams from Major SEHMER and after about
five minutes he was brought back into my room and the inter-
rogation was continued. When Major SEHMER hesitated in his
statements, HABBCKBR took a piece of wood readied for this pur-
pose, out of his pocket and braided it between the fingers of
Major SEHMER. He then pulled the hands of the prisoner behind
his back and started to press the fingers together. This was
extremely painful for Major SEHMER without causing any visible
injury. The interrogation continued with HABECKER's asking
about the name and rank of the highest ranking officer in Bari.
Finally Major SEHMER did mention a name, but I do not know if
it was the right one. The pieces of wood were removed from the
fingers and the interrogation continued in a quiet manner.
Finally Major SEHMER was taken back to his cell and I never saw
him again. After lunch I returned to the interrogation room
and saw a man dressed in the, uniform of a British Sergeant bound
by chains in a kneeling position. HABECKER stood there with
a horsewhip in his hand, but as soon as he saw me, he put the
horsewhip away and freed the prisoner from the chains. He was
permitted to sit down. HABECKER said: "Now we can begin with
the interrogation." WILLIS then said, he was a member of the
Palestine Police and belonged to the Anglo-American Mission for
Slovakia. WILLIS was questioned the same as was Major SEHMER
and replied also that the Mission existed only to show the
Partisans the flag. WILLIS said he was a wireless operator.
After the interrogation WILLIS was taken away and I never saw
him again. With the exception of ALTFULDISCH, who was present
only a short time, I was the only witness to the torturing of
the British personnel. I always protested most strongly against
it.﻿I would describe WILLIS as a man of medium height, blond
^.rly hair, blue eyes and spoke English with a slight Jewish
accent. He spoke some German, too. He was of slim build.
WILLIS said that he was an orthodox Jew.
After the interrogation I returned to Berlin.
HABECKER was about 55 years old, bald on the top of the
head and hair shaved off on the sides. Hard lines between the
nose and the corners of the mouth. Blue eyes. Height about
5 feet 8. Not very broad but looked stout. Very heavy smoker.
Speaks German with a raw Berlin accent. Not of good family.
In the first World War he w^s a sailor on a submarine and was
in Pola in the vicinity of Trieste.
I am of the opinion that prisoners who are now in Dachau,
and who were members of the Gestapo Hq, Berlin, could give a
more exact and better description.
I have been told that I am under no obligation to make
*
this statement, if I do not wish to do so and that every state-
ment which I make will be written down and may be used as evidence
at any time in the future. I am making this statement of my
own free will and not under duress or persuasion, or because
I have been promised a reward.

SUBJECT:
Dr Hans THOST
1
A former S.S. Oberscharfuehrer, Josef NIEDERMAYER, born
11.4.1920, now awaiting confirmation of death sentance at Landsberg, was
interrogated by me about a different case to the above. However, since he
was at Matthausen during 1942-1945> I asked him whether he remembered a
Gestapo Party from Berlin come down to "interrogate" a party of British
and American officers, and if he remembered any names and details connected
with it.
His reply was in the affirmative, but he explained that the
2,
whole affair was very secret and hush-hush, but what he gathered was that
the chief of the British Interrogation was a Dr THOST from Amt IV or VI in
Berlin, where he dealt only with British affairs. To further questions he
was very definite that THOST was NOT there as an interpreter but one of the
chiefs of the interrogation . For the other names, such as HABECKER, SCHOEN-
ENSEIFEN etc., he had to be prompted.
3.	The main name he seemed to recall immediately was only that
of Dr. THOST. He was not inclined to make a sworn statement at the time, but
I am pretty sure I can get one out of him when I will make a more detailed
interrogation. He added that it was also said that THOST had been an agent
in England prior to his Amt VI appointment.

Dear
K
I su so sony not to have jmswerod your note before, but \ (A
no sooner had it arrived than I went away on the Continent and
on and off I have been in France and Germany for the past month.

The matter of our friend Jones has proved most difficult and
troublesome as so many of the early papers were in the
possession of A.G.y(V.'.V.) and the research lias taken a
considerable amount of time. However, amongst the many
volumes of MAUTHAUHKN, which are in our"archives, I have found
a letter from A.G.3 (V.W.) to Gas(L) Liverpool, stating that
Jones is identical with 815029 Acting Bombardier a.G. Jones,
R.A, and that he is identical with a Jones who was at
NATZV/RILBR and later gassed at MAUTKAUSKN, It seems that after
the capitulation of France in June 1940, this Jones, who was
formerly of the 23rd Field Regiment, R.A., remainau in hiding
and was eventually captured in Belgium by the Gestapo and taken
to NATZVffilLER.
Amongst our files 1 have also traced a copy letter dated
29 July 1945 from an L.A.C. L.J, Jones, R.A.F, to his parents
in which he describes investigations v/hich he personally made
at Brussels in 1945 in an endeavour to find information relating
to his brother Alfred, It seems that "Alfred" must be the
man to are interested in. I now enclose a copy of this letter
from L.A.C. Jones,
/I﻿I mow ell this information must be very confusing to you,
but I am afraid that the various officers who, most J^bably,
did deal with this matter in the past have long sinJi^ani..»tfd
from the dapar-taient and tna only tiling v.e hove left now is
mass of files. I cannot personally assist very much as 1 am
completely out of the picture in this case, but I have told
you now aU that wa have on the files relating to Jones, but if,
howsvdr, you fael that there is anything further I can do in this
matter, plausa let me mnow and I will do what I can.

APO 512
6 June 1945
Subject: Y/ar Crimes Investigation - "Dawes” Case
To	: War Crimes Branch, Judge Advocate General’s
Department, MTOUSA, APO 512, U.S. Army
1.	The War Crimes Investigation Section of this Head-
quarters has under investigation the circumstances surround-
ing the probable murder of at least nine military personnel
from this Headquarters along with three British military per-
sonnel and one American reporter. The persons from this Head-
quarters, above-mentioned, were part of an operation known as
"Dawes". This matter is therefore referred to herein as the
"Dawes" case.
2.	The Dawes mission was a legitimate military mission
to the Czechoslovak Forces of the Interior with headquarters
at Banska Bistrica. All members of the mission went to Banska
Bistrica in regular U. S. Army or U. S. Navy uniforms. From
information at hand, it is believed that they remained in uni-
form at all times, except in one instance, where one officer
in attempting to escape from the Germans changed into civilian
clothing. This officer was apprehended separately from the
remainder of the group. Due to bad weather, it was impossible
to evacuate the mission by aircraft of the 15th Air Force as
had been planned. The American mission was forced to remain
with the units of the CFI after the collapse of resistance by
the Czechoslovak Forces. Two members of the mission were ap-
prehended at the town of Myto, Slovakia on 12 December 1944;
seven members of the American mission were apprehended at the
town of Polomka, Slovakia on 26 December 1944, in company with
the three Britishers mentioned in paragraph 1. One officer,
the one who changed to civilian clothing was apprehended on
9 December 1944 at Pieste, Slovakia.
At the present’ time, the Allies have in custody an RSHA
interpreter, known as YVerner Mueller. This individual has tes
tified that he aided in the interrogation of members of the
Dawes mission at Mauthausen Concentration Camp, Mauthausen,
Austria. He has also testified that the entire group was ex-
ecuted at Mauthausen. The execution, he states, was super-
vised by the Commandant of the Concentration Camp.
SECRET
r.)
﻿Another source of information has testified that he
witnessed the execution of Pho. M. Nelson B. Paris, a member
of the Dawes mission, on £1 April 1945, This witness, who is
also an ex-Mauthausen prisoner took the Navy dog-tags from the
dead body of Paris and gave them to Lt. Jack Taylor, USNR, who
copied the information from the dog-tags. Unfortunately, the
dog-tags have been misplaced, and are believed by Taylor to
have been returned to the witness who originally gave them to
him. Further investigation in this case is presently in progress,
3.	This organization has in its possession the origi-
nal roster of SS personnel at Mauthausen Concentration Camp.
This roster was obtained by Lt. Taylor from the office at the
Camp. The list of names attached is a complete copy of the
Mauthausen personnel roster. All of these individuals are
wanted by this organization for questioning in connection with
the murder of the American personnel of the Dawes mission. It
is probable that the defendants in the Dawes case are included
in the list. A substantial number of witnesses in connection
with the case are undoubtedly also included.
4.	It is requested that you notify the proper author-
ities in both MTOUSA and STOUSA that persons named in the attached
list are wanted as war criminals or as witnesses in a war crimes
matter. This Headquarters should be notified if and when any of
these persons are apprehended.
5.	I would like to point out that every person named
in the list is an SS member. As the staff in one of the most
notorious concentration camps they should be able to furnish
details of the camp that would aid in the prosecution of Germans
who are on a higher echelon.
6.	A complete and detailed report in connection with
the "Dawes" case will be furnished to your Branch within the near
future.﻿S’OM GO

According to liberated prisoners, they were made to carry rocks up
168 steps leading to the top of a quarry, while guards lashed them with

At the top of the steins the men were made to throw the rocks down into

Camp Aide Says
Killed Morton*, AP Man
By LYNN HESNZEKLING
Associated Press Correspondent
LINZ, Austria, July 9 — Joseph
Morton, Associated Press corre-
spondent who flew into Czechoslo-
vakia last October during the up-
rising by Czechoslovak Patriots
there, was executed in the Maut-
hausen concentration camp 15 miles
east of here on Jan, 24 on direct
orders from Heinrich Himmler’s of-
fices in Berlin, German officials
now in custody say.
Morton, who came out of Ru-
mania with the first interview with
King Mihai last year, was captured
near Polomka, in Slovakia, the day
after last Christmas. He was taken
to Bratislava, and arrived at Maut-
hausen early in January.
Nine other Americans and four
British men — all members of a
group which flew into Slovakia to
help bring out American flyers
stranded there — were shot to death
with Morton, and their bodies were
cremated, according to these wit-
nesses.
Mauthausen is rated fifth in the
list of major Nazi extermination
camps, and thousands of men and
women were executed there or al-
lowed to starve to death slowly. The
commandant of the camp — Stand-
arenfuehrer Franz Ziereiss, sadis-
tic, swaggering SS officer who at-
tended all executions — was shot
trying to escape, and later died.
One of the Germans held, an in-
terpreter, was present during the
interrogation of the group in Maut-
hausen. He stated that some mem-
bers of the group were beaten and
tortured in an effort to wring in-
formation from them, but that
Morton “underwent interrogation
without difficulties or hardships.”
Some of the men were beaten
with a stick held by one of the
interrogators, he said. One man had
his wrists tied behind his back, and
was then suspended from the ceil-
ing by a chain attached to his
wrists. This treatment usually tears
the victim’s shoulders from the
sockets.
“When we questioned Morton,”
the interpreter said, “he asked about
his fate and stressed that he wasmo
soldier, but a reporter, and had
nothing to do with the group of-
ficially. He asked whether he could
EXECUTED?
not be allowed to send a telegram to
the Associated Press.”
Nevertheless, a few days later a,
telegram came from Berlin, saying
that the execution was to be carried i
out. This telegram was signed by,
Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Himmler’s;
right-hand man and chief of the
German security police. It was re-,
ceived by Adolf Zutter, adjutant of
the camp, and passed on to Ziereiss.
That same day, before the inter-
rogation was completed, according'
to the interpreter, the men were led
out of their cells to exchange for
prison garb the uniforms they had,
worn since capture, and were taken
to the execution room.
Wilhelm Ornstein, Polish Jew who
was a prisoner at the camp and
whose duty it was to remove the
bodies from the execution chamber,
recalls the execution of the 14. He
also removed the dogtags of two of
the Americans (not including Mor-
ton) and turned them over to Amer-
ican investigators.
Morton had flown to Slovakia on
Oct. 7, 1944, from Italy in one of
(Continued on page 8)﻿Camp Aide Says Nazis
Killed Morion^ AP Mao
(Continued from page 1)
the six Flying Fortresses sent there
to evacuate a group of flyers col-
lected at a landing strip in the
tiands of Czechoslovak partisans
»iear Banska Bystrica.
A number of American and Brit-
ish officers and men went on the
same flight, to stay behind and help
iin collecting escaped flyers. The
planes were received enthusiasti-
cally by the Slovaks at the airfield,
Morton wrote a short story about
the evacuated flyers, sending it back
J'.h the planes,-which left about a
If hour after landing. Morton
;n remained at Banska Bystrica
-h the rescue mission.
"he Germans were counterattack-
: heavily against Czechoslovak
ces at the time, and the front
s collapsing. The following day a
party moved to Brezno because of
the threatening situation, but re-
turned to Banska Bystrica about a
week later.
fThe town of about 25,000 inhabi-
tapts, nestling in the valley, was
heavily bombed by German Stukas
on Oct. 20, and five days later the
grpup moved to Donlavy. The Ger-
man advance was so swift, however,
that three days later the group de-
cided to move into the mountains
of the lower Tatra range, and head
for the Russian lines reported to be
“five days away.”
Partisan who dived through a win-
dow and watched subsequent de-
velopments from a nearby wood.
The party was taken to Bratis-
lava, later to Austria and Mauthau-
sen. Zutter said that he and all
other department executives in the
camp were ordered to burn secret
documents before the arrival of
the Americans. There certainly was
no trial or pretense of a trial.
The interpreter now in custody
said he went to Mauthausen from
Berlin with two German agents and
began interrogation of the group
Jan. 7.
He said he remembered Morton
well because of his insistence that
he was a reporter.
CZECHS JOIN UP
On Oct. 31, Morton and others
were in the Brasiva region, and
joiped with Czech patriots in
march toward the Russian lines. Ac-
cording to the survivors of this
march, almost every one was suf-
fering frost-bitten feet, but pushed
doggedly ahead for 15 hours.
Some of the party were suffering
from influenza, too. There was al-
most no food. Eighty-three mem-
b£rs of the Qzech Partisan group,
With which the party traveled the
first 15 days in November, froze to
death. Three members of the
Allied group were captured by Ger-
man patrols during the bitter jour-
ney over the mountains in almost
blinding snowstorms.
On Nov. 30, the party was at-
tacked by the Germans while rest-
ing in a mining camp near Dolma
Lehota. Morton and the rest man-
aged to escape, and set off imme-
diately for Polomka.
The following day they reached
the village of Myto, and stayed
there until Dec. 12, nursing infected
feet. That day a German patrol
captured two more members of the
party, and it was necessary to de-
part immediately for Polomka. They
reached a shack about a three-mile
hike from Polomka on Dec 14, and
remained there to recover strength.
On Christmas Eve there was a
small Christmas party in the shack,
decorated with American and Brit-
ish flags for the occasion. Next day
the shack was fired from all sides
by a large group of German troops,
Ukrainian soldiers of General Vla-
sov and Slovakian Hlinka Guard-
Morton and all other Allied per-
sonnel in the shack were captured
vith the exception of a Slovakian
FORTY-CELL BLOCK
The cellblock where Morton and
other members of the group were
held in Mauthausen is called “the
Bunker.” On the main floor are
some forty cells, where the most
important prisoners are held, and
administration and interrogation
rooms.
In the execution room, where the
shootings were carried out, a
dummy camera was rigged up and
the prisoners were taken into the
room with the understanding they
were to be photographed. After fac-
ing the camera they were told to
turn their backs, and an SS officer
then stepped up and shot them in
the back of the neck.
Ornstein said he remembered
that one member had to be shot
twice, and that the SS officer came
into the cooling room to fire the
second shot.
He also remembered that one
officer standing in a room before
a fake camera protested angrily
against his execution, asserting, “I,
am an American officer. Why1
should I be executed?”
After each man was shot, Om-
stein, watching from a small peep-
hole in the door, hurried into the
room, removed the body and swab-
bed the floor.
Ziereiss, in his death-bed state-
ment, said that 65,000 men and
women were killed at Mauthausen
and in the nearby camp of Gusen
since 1939, but Ornstein put the
figure in hundreds of thousands.
Ziereiss, in his statement which
covered not only Mauthausen, but
other concentration camps, said
some persons were killed by doc-
tors, who removed portions of their
brains, while others were killed by
an injection of gasoline into their
veins.	.
Ziereiss said that the gas cham-
ber in Mauthausen was constructed
on the order of Oberfgruppeufueh-
rer Glueck, “because he held the
view that the gassing of human
beings was more humane and more
cultural than shooting.”

SUBJECT: FATiaUSEI'T Concentration camp.
Have you any records of MATMUSEN (or mUTH&USEN)
KZ (OBEIfflCNAU)3 19 kni south-east of LINZ which consisted
of the main concentration camp and within a "radius of 5 km
(part now in Russian, part in American zone), the "twin"
camps of GUSEN-ST.GEORGEN and to the East of the latter a
subsidiary known as ST.GEORGSN-IAGERSTEIN^• These seem to
have been extermination camps (with gas chambers etc) though
the MATBAUSSN commandant had also some forty-five camps
altogether under him (including special labour camps etc.)
2.
X understand that a SHAH? Court cf inquiry was in
fact held into MATHAUSEN Concentration Camp after the liberation,
though I have not yet been able to procure a copy.
3
However, I have in my possession a copy of a
Confession by the Commandant, gtandartenfuhrer ZIEHEISj which
he made whilst being interrogated by two intelligence officers
on 24 May 45 before dying of wounds. This Confession was taken
down by a polish doctor and was in whole or part released by
the American authorities to the press several months ago,
though the original only came into my possession last month
and has now been sent on to British war Crimes Executive at
NUREMBERG. I forwarded ny last spare copy of the translation
to JAG1a Branch, British Troops in AUSTRIA, under cover of my
minute of even reference dated ^0 Rov 45 but learn that they
have no records of the camp but that any information might be
in your possession.
4.	The above document discloses that members of an
Anglo-American Military Mission to TITO* captured in CROATIA,

MATHAUSEKT Concentration Camp (taken^dWn on 24 May 45 iy a polish
doctor of Msiioine in a n American hospital, GUSEN, during the
interrogation of ZIEEEIS by intelligence officers, and certified
correct by the doctor, signature, illegible, from D.P. Lazarett, 397
flir Ausl^nder LINZ-NIEDERNHAED under date 2.6 gep 45, translated by
school teacher).
pocuments given by a Doctor TOM the polish D.P. Camp
COLOGNE, MULHEIM to ADJAG, 1 Corps, and originals passed to JAG WCS
to BWCE NUEEMBEEG 19 Nov 45.﻿f	On 23rd of May 1945, about 18 o'clock I was Wounded near the
'ottage of PRIN, near Spital by American Soldiers while trying to escape
ihem. My name is FRifflZ ZIEEEIS, born 13 August 1905. I was coramander-in~
‘ :ef of lager Mathausen and the other camps depending on that camp, I
'g jhot through the left upper arm and also in the back. The gun-bullet
went through the center and came out the other side, I had been brought to
the 131st (US) Evac Hosp at Cusen and I want to declare as follows:	©
According to the order of Reichminister HIMMIER 1 had to kill
all the prisoners owing to a statement of Obergruppenfuhrer Dr, KALTENBRUNWJIR.
The prisoners had to be put in a tunnel, the doors of that tunnel had to be
closed with stones and cement in advance and then the hole had to be blown up
with dynamite. I refused to obey this order. I understand the prisoners of
Lager G-usen I and II to be liquidated by this processing. All details above
that are known to Mr. W0IPRAM and Obcrsturmfuhrer EC'KWMM. The latter was
working in BERGERISTALL.
In Mauthausen camp a gas-room Was built according to an order of
S3-Hauptsturmfuhrcr Dr. KEEBSBACH. That room had been built similar to the
bath room here. In this room the prisoners had been gassed. Besides that
a special motor-car was running between Mauthausen and Gusen in which
prisoners had been gassed also. The chemist S8~Unterstumfuhrer WASICKI
gave this car for this purpose. I had perfectly known that prisoners had
been gassed during the travel. The gassing was done on pressure of the
doctor, SS-Haupstumfuhrer Dr. B. KKEBSBACH, who must be actually in Kassel.
He has been eliminated from the- S3, because he had been Free-Mason and played
with double-face, On all the prisoners we had liquidated orders came from the
Reich-Sicherheitshaujjtarnt or from HIMMIER or from HEYDRICH or from G-ruppen-
fuhrer MULLER or even from Dr. KALTEN-EECHKER, chief of the Sicherheitspolisei
I know nothing at all about the last 800 prisoners having been
killed in G-usen II by sticks, stones or having been drowned, I gave not the
orders for such a killing. Furthermore, I know nothing at all about th^:
gassing of 640 prisoners in Gusen I on ward No, 31 by German prisoners F.IEGEL,
AMEGONG (already dead) and LIESBERG, the blockmaster from ward 15, according
toan order from the Boramand'er of camp (SEIDLER) and Rapportfuhrer GILlEMANN
on co’ndition that, if the German prisoners are not willing to execute that
order they never would go alive through the great door,
I donot know about the whereabouts of Oberscharfuhrer JENTSON, who
killed in comp Gusen I about 700 prisoners by the manner that he let them
stand naked, spraying ice-cold water on them at 12° frost, several hours
outdoors. I do not know the refuge of SS-Untersturmfuhrer Dr. NIDESEWETIER
who murdered several hundred prisoners by intravenous injections with gaso-
line, hydrogen (40ccm), Caliumsulphurioum 25 Eunarcon and Evipan.
Dr. RICHTER, who murdered several hundred prisoners by operating
on them without any reason and cut away the brain, stomach, spleen	or
other iaiteriors, was sent by me to camp Gunzkirchen with the order, to take
care of? the prisoners in that camp.
I knew absolutely nothing that Unt erst urmf uhrer MIER0V, who was
in Pagau, shot 15 sick prisoners,
I know very well that all cruelties by beating prisoners with
a'stick were forbidden by Berlin, but nevertheless I myself have beaten them
for merely sadism.
Obergruppertfuhrer P0HL gave order to chase sick prisoners, who
were not entitles to get food in the camj), in the forests where they had to
feed themselves by fruits, berries, etc. He cut down the daily rations ^>f
750 grams to 350 grams per week and in the last 12 days we had neither bread
nor meat,	c﻿
Gruppenfubrer GLUCKS Jjave orf-ers to sign sick prisoners as
s ,oken-by mental derangements and to gas them. About ONE MILLION and a
HALE have been murdered in this v/ay. The gas-room lies in Harthoim near Linz
in the direction to Passau, 10 klintrs. from Emz.
But in this camp such gassed prisoners have been reported as
normal dead. The statements of such killed prisoners were already made out
when still, alive or on transport, this done 'by the administrative section of
Gusen camp,
I want to be confronted with HIMMLER and Obergruppenfuhrer GLUCK
POHL and GLUECK must be actually in SANCT LAMBEECHE in the Crevezen Cottage
(that is about 4 hours up in the hills).
The gas-room in Mauthausen has been built on order of Grttppen-
fuhrer GLUECK as he supposed that it is more human to gas gjeople than to
liquidate them by shooting.
One day, without former information, Obergruppenfuehrer POHL
sent a transport of 6,000 women and children, all having been without food
for 10 days on transport. They had been on the railway in open cattle-
carriages, without blankets, in December 1943> in an icy cold. According to
an order received from Berlin, I had to send the children immediately to
Bergen-Belsen camp and I suppose they all died a dreadful death. This was
a reason for ray break-down of nerves.
Another transport of 2,500 prisoners came from Aushwitz camp to
Mauthausen and had to be sprayed with cold water in winter on the Appell-
place I had to send these prisoners to Gusen camp, away of about 5 klmtrs,,
and we had no clothes for them besides underwear, I asked for clothes for
the prisoners, but I got the reply from Berlin, to send them naked to Gusen
if no clothes are available. I sent them along in underwear. Such cases
happened at several times,
Gauleiter EIGRUBER has forbidden all food for new-arriving or
sick prisoners, he gave even order that of the potatoes having already
prepared for the necessities of the camp had to be handed over to the
civilians.
Gruppenfuehrer GLUECK was that man who gave the order that the
whole staff having been working in the Mauthausen crematoria had to be sent
to Gusen camp where they had to be liquidated by shooting in the neck for
the only reason because some of them had been already working in Auschwitz
crematoria and could have given information about these crematorias.
There was a secret order that the staff of the crematoria had
to be liquidated every three weeks, It concerned all prisoners without any
exception who worked in the crematoria. There was also an order to
liquidate all doctors having been Working in the hospital. I refused to do
so. This order was given by SS-Standartenfuehrer LOLLING to all SS-doctors.
But I had forbidden and prevented this order when it was made public.
Furthermore all prisoners y/ho had a job in the hospital had to be brought
into other camps in order to be liquidated (from Mauthausen), But Dr .WALTER,
who has been chief Medicine of SS in Mauthausen, refused the execution of
this order. He must be in ?	and I was told that he has got the
fleck-fever.
Wllen I was Commandant of Mauthausen, the following camps were
attached also:
/ 3﻿I had some more camps under my authority, about 4bj d do not
remember tjie exact number.
Very interesting was the Schlier camp, where all workers were
Jewish graphics or lithographs (about-a thousand) They printed false
foreign banknotes, passports, permits, etc. of the whole world.
Transports of Jews; In presence of Gauleiter BAYNER, Dr.
UESERRLITEH, Dr. JURY, Baldir von SCHIEACH and others I got the following
order from HBMLER: All the Jews £rom all the localities in the Southeast,
working in the so-called fortification-commands have to go (walk) by foot
to Mauthausen camp. 60,000 Jews according to this order were expected
in Mauthausen camp, but only a little fraction arrived indeed. I remember
that a transport of 4,500 Jews left somewhere in the country, but only 180
arrived in Mauthausen. Women and children had been without shoes, clothes
and completely full up with lice. In that transport were complete families
when leaving, but an enormous number had been killed on the way while weak,
sick, etc. ZIEREIS states that owing to his wits, the Jews having been
lodgea in the so-called tent-camp Mauthausen had a human life and treatment
nearly no deaths, the Jews got good food, a rest, and then only they had
been sent to Gunzkirchen camp, Zierois suggested witness: the Czecho-

always improve the living of the Jews.- (Thereupon was stated^by prisoner
Dr. Tonia: Just in the tent-camp the Jews died on masse, when ZIEEEIS speaks
about a human treatment and living, this must be called a nasty arrogancy.
Only on one transport of 5,000 Jews leaving Mauthausen to Gunzkirchen, a
distance of 4 klmtrs. - vtauthausen camp> to railway bridge Mauthausen - 800
shot bodies of Jewsphad been counted. Several trucks had to be ordered to.

els, dollars or other money. All letters he got from HIMMLER have been
burnt also the orders, photos.
The paymaster, SS-man EISENHOREER, took all the money with him.
Messerschmidt factories, according to the confession of ZIEEEIS,
paid a daily sum of 8.-Rinks for each prisoner to the chief-administration
in Oranienburg-Berlin, but the prisoner himself got only 50 Pfgs, a day.
ZIEEEIS was ashamed of this corruption, and energitacally requested aa
consultation with the heads of Nazism. Quote: "I will throw the full
truth into their face about all those betrayers and murders". "I was no
student, I Was a simple soldier and I have got this post owing to my own
will, energy and hard work ! "
YJhorehouse: In Mauthausen existed a whorehouse, every man had
to pay 2.—Rmks, the woman got 50 pfgs, and the HQ of the Concentration

Thd head of the camp-administration STRAUSS is with his family
in Helferiberg '(not far from Preystadt), in a little house belonging to
SS-Sturmbannfuehrer SCHULFETZKI, who has gassed with Cyclon-gas in the
night on 13th March 1941 the ward no 16 with about 170 Russians war-prisoners
according to an order of SS-Iiaupstumfuehrer CHMIELEFSKI, who' got later
orders to go to a camp ,in Holland, together with Dr. KREBSBACH, CHMIELEFSKI
often completely drunk, has beaten with sticks, murdered by rifles, drowned’
in water containers the prisoners in his camp in Holland. He was eliminated
from the SS because he had stolen clothes, money, gold, jewels and diamonds
from prisoners. He ordered women to come to the officers' mess in the camp,
has- beaten them and abused them. He directed his own "beer-news". Later on
he was sentenced to 15 years hard labour, but the judgment has not been
confirmed by the Reichsfuehrer. His successor in Holland was SS-Sturm-
bannfuehrer GRUENEFAID, sentenced to death, but graced by the SS-Reichs-
fuehrer, and later on reinstalled again as SS-Puehrer, He locked 43 women
in an air-tight cell and let them die of suffocation. He cannot remember

Gusen, 24.5.1945-
My dear wife,
I had been found (23rd of May 1945) by the Americans while you have
been out shopping, I laid ny machine-gun behind a tree, about 4 mtrs. away
from the cottage, in the direction which leads along the riven to Lieaen. I
ask you, my dear, to come with the children to Gusen, call at Dr. GOSCHINSKI.
You may be submitted to an interview and I ask you to say the full truth,
namely give a full statement about the conduct of the heads in Berlin. Further-
more give these gentlemen knowledge of our decision to go both into death to
enable our children a better life. When arrested, I lost my nerves. I laid
my machine-gun by the tree instead of using it, as I am known as a master of
the rifle. The Americans showed perfect conduct, but they prevented my
flight by means of arms, I had been shot twice and I could not rise, I am
now in the American Hospital in Gusen Camp. I have said everything I had
known, as far as it was possible with the heavy wounds. I have. I have some
more details to relate, especially about the' dirty conduct of gentlemen in
Berlin, including the Reichsfuehrer. Please come and let know everybody here
how they treated us miserably. Tell the gentlemen about the swinish conduct of
ObergruppOnfuehrer POHL.
Your loving husband

About dissolving the farm St. Lambrecht-command ZIEBEIS states as
follows: the administration of this farm Was in the hands of a Standarten-
fuehror from Munich, who, together with POHL and some women, often held
exciting festivals in St. Lambrecht; but the prisoners were in their way
and therefore they resolved to denouce the prisoners claiming that had stolen
the farm and that they prepared an attempt of flight. The command was
dissolved according to an order from Mauthausen camp heads and the prisoners
have been brought back to the camp. ZIEBEIS states that he got the order to
liquidate them at once on arrival in order to have no witnesses about the
doings in St. Lambrecht. A part of these prisoners had been "chased into
the eletric-wiring", another part Was torn by BACHMEYER’s dog Lord. Again
another one was sent to Guseh camp for hard laboui?.
Execution of 58 Austrians on 29th ^pril 1945
ZIEREIS cannot 'state the reason for the execution of the 38
Austrians sitting already more than one year in Mauthausen camp. He only
can' say that according to an idea of Gauleiter EIGRUBER, Dr. PFIFFRATER and
the head of .the Linz-Gestapo APAHN this execution has been done. To survey
theexecution itself a certain PROCHASKA, agent for the Gestapo, had been
charged. It is said that the execution was done by this man with two
Blockfuehrers from Mauthausen camp). In this matter I must confess, it is ,
exact that the PROCHASKA and a Gestapo‘-employee POECHER from the Linz-
Gestapo brought up to Mauthausen the order for the execution.
(Remarks of the Secretary No. 1 (PANEX) and No. 2 (MARSAEEK) of Mauth.
camp:
The execution had to take place in the night from 28th to 29th of
April 1945 on pressure of the head of the political section of Mauthausen camp,
SCHULZ, but it had been postponed several times. In the same night about
11 o/cloek the famous'Ha optscharfuehrer SPATZENEGGER and some other Unter-
scharfuehrers demanded the immediate presentation of the delinquents and their
execution. All having been provided) with automatic machine-rifles ( not the
prisoners). Ife, the prisoner-secretaries, refused to do so and stated., that﻿■we had orders for execution the following morning only.' That order- came from
'*’■ Lagerfuehrer ALFULISCH, who really gave us the order for the follovdng
i.1u...-dng. SPATZEKEGGER and his men strolled avfay and we informed at once
the Austrians about the sort awaiting them in the morning. They tried to
escape, but owing to misfortune and treason of other prisoners they were
unsuccessful. One man, called DIETEL, who got refuge in the hospital-camp
Mauthausen. SPATMEGG-ER did; not 'return the next morning, the prisoners had
to call at the secretary about 8 o'clock, they had to stand by the kitchen
until noon, then they wore conducted by Oberscharfuehrer NJJDERMAXER in a
courtyard where they were murdered by two Blockfuehrers with automatic
machine-guns. PROCHASKA was not present at the execution.
One night in February 1945 an Anglo-American -Military Mission from
Croatia, having been alleged;connection with TITO, was brought into
Mauthausen Camp. ZIEREIS denied to have been present during such interro-
gations or tortures of the Anglo-Americans. If such cruelties have been
committed against the Anglo- Americans, only on order of BACHMEYER. ZIERoIS
confesses that after the interrogation of the Anglo-Americans such trials
have been called in the camp "the Tibetan Prayer". /Iter that, they.have
been brought in a car to Dachau camp, the car has been driven by a lieutenant
from Berlin, whose name is’ unknown to him. ¥hen ZIEREIS ’was told that it was
a lie what he was saying about the Anglo-Americans, he several times stated:
"No, no, they drove away to Dachau". According to statements of ZDEREIS it
was Criminal Commissar HAMECHEN, Referat 4, 8/11, Reichssicherheits-Hauptamt
Berlin, and Standartenfuehrer GESCHKE, who led the Tibetan Prayer, ( a term
used in the prison camps after the lorture of the Anglo-American Mission).
About HEYDRICH ZIEREIS says: all the Czechoslovakians murdered in
Mauthausen -Sfimp have been executed according to an order from H.H.ERANK.
Himself was against such a killing en masse (ZIEREIS).
ZIEREIS says furthermore: I know some details above other camps.
In the year 1941 all the commanders of all the Gorman concentration camps
have deen ordered to Sachsenhausen-Berlin where we saw how on the quickest
way the Politrucksand Russina Commisars have been liquidated. In one part
of the ward the Russians have been gathered and conducted in an execution-
cell, through a dark gangway whilst a wireless was loudly tuning. On the
other side of the cell was a hole in the wall With a mobile rest for a gun.
When the politrucks or commissars have been liquidated by. neck-shooting,'
all the SS-Fuehrers of GLUCK's staff were drunk] the investion of this
killing was made by SS-Oberfuehrer LORfffiZ, The bodies of the killed
Russians have been thrown outside by two SS-Oberscharfuehror with an
extraordinary cruelty, - They had eight mobile crematoria which were
constantly in action. The could manage between 1500 to 2000bodies a day.
I think that the burning kept on for 5 weeks at least. On our arrival in
Sachsenhausen the burning already was, going on about a fortnight.
In Gres-Rosen camp the prisoners got Zyancali-solution in the
cardiac veins, by the SS-doctor. There were several SS-doctors who changed
permanently. The commander was SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer ARTHUR ROGEL,
In Bnchenwald camp I was witness, whilst still staying with the
troops, when there .jyas taken away from Jewish prisoners all their money,
gold, jewels, especially known for such robbing was Oberstumfuehrer
MACKMANN, Untersturmfuchrer MEYER, a parent of HIMMLER. Everybody in that ■
camp got a big car at once. HACKMAMN drove out in a cutaway and high hat,
with stolen diamonds on his fingers, MEYER- imitated like a monkey all these
manners. The surveyor of Buchenwald arrest calls was also a specialist in
robbing and drove out drunk, with a naked woman in the car, to Erfurt, .where
•he spent in bars 5;000 - a night - of course he paid with stolen money.﻿If'I remember well, Obsoharfuhrer HIESCH, the master of the arrest
cells, has been shot because every escape was impossible. Stumbamifuhrer
is told to have given himself this advice of suicide. HIRSCH had known
h the details of the commander KOCH. KOCH was syphylitic and got treat-
ment by a prisoner-doctor whom he later on murdered with the. help of a SS-
raedecin. With the fortune of the JEWS a big deal was made, a blanket value
Einks, 2,50 about was sold at Krnks. 100. -
A S0-doctor, Strurnbannfuhrer Dr. Kirchner, pschiatic, killed a
great number of prisoners, stating them sinply mad. This action, also in
other coops was officially stated in the reports under No 14 P 13 to prevent
biological disease. The prisoners from Dachau, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen
have been presented a commission from Berlin, whose head was SS-Hauptsturm
fuhrer Dr. LONAUER, who had a clinic in Linz, Hearthelm. They have been
reported as mental-inferior and I think that with an average of 20,000 pris-
oners during'one year and a half POUR MILLION must have gassed in that gas-
room of Dr, L0NAUER nr. Linz. Like Mauthausen, that gas room looked exactly
like a bath-room. The execution was not’ in the hands of the S3. -Dr,
LOMAHER and pr> BEINAIB, but in the hands of officers of the police. I do
not remember the name of the head of the police - he was killed later on in
Croatia. They had been gassed by coaloxyd-gas. The ashes wdre gathered
behind the doctor's clinic and when the action was stopped ashes were
loaded on trucks and dumped in the Danube. It is said that HITLER himself
^ave the orders to stop this action. His reason was information to the
parents of the killed ( condoleance-letter's) people got ashes of the dead
2 or 3 times.
In Auschwitz camp the Cor;5missioner of the Reichsfuhrer had stolen
40 kgs. of tooth-gold, I do not remember the name of that man, but I am sure
thatGLUCK must know him. In all camps the hair of men, women and children
have been 9ut and Saved, the hair was used to make shoos for the winter-
equipment df the army. In order to prevent^ any loss of hair, men had only
just a small cut in the hair as large as the hair cutting machine itself.
'The murdered HELDRICH gave orders that all faces of the prisoners
are to be marked’with an invisialb ink first, from the top of the forehead
to the nose and across on the cheeks. This tatoo kept about three months
and had to be renewed afterwards. GLUCK and H0SCH orderedwhilst commanders
of Aushwitz camp, the tatoo with number on the arms of the prisoners. In
Mauthausen tatoos were scarce.
In Mauthausen there had been a gas room converted from a bath room,
or vice-versa, next door to the crematoria. Owing to the confession of
ZIEREIS, only executions have been persomed in this room. (That's not true -
this is a notation of Dr. Toni ).
ZIEKEIS denies that he gave order that prisoners in Gusen Camp
had to stay naked in cold winter before the wards until they fell dead on
the ground. Wien he learnt such an order, he had forbidden it at once and
told about that to GLUCK, who treated his as SCHELSSKERL,
In the year 1942/43 1,000 Dutch Jews were brought to Mauthausen.
On 31.5.43 HIMMLER Was present and ordered that the Jews had to carry on
their shoulders heavy stones of granite, more than 50 kgs. These stones
had to be brought up a high stair to build up the road near Wiener Graben.
They nearly all committed suicide by jumping down the high wall about 50
mtrs. in the deep. Shortly after HIMMLER'S visit ZIEEEIS gave knowledge
of that order to GLUCK and told to stop such action knowing all the civilians
could see it. The answer he. got was that nobody has to get excited about
an order coming from the Reichsfuhrer himself. Three months later on about
1,000 Czechoslovakian Jews arrived. The mortality waS at that time only y/o.
The heads in Berlin believed it not enough and Lippenhenschel rang up
ZIEREIS and asked him what Was going on that he did not get numbers of killed.
ZIEKEIS says that he, replied that he wants all the men for working pirposes.﻿- 8 —
Prom that tine ZIEEEIS was treated as unreliable, and.suspicious. He got
on reclamation after the other, as ho says ( but he advanced from Stum-
bannfuhrer to Standartenfuhrer iI).
Concerning the "Proninient" prisoners. ZHiEEIS stated as follows:
The son of HOETHY lived here under the name "mouse", Badaglio
under the name BEEUSE5ffiTTBE and CQRTE under his real name. According to
the order of Gauleiter EIGEUBER all had to be liquidated, but after an
interview with Col. HOPPER I refused to obey this order. He sent them to
Dachau, besides Corte, who has been put in the cell-ward. The doors of
the cell has always been unlocked, he got S^-food,
ZIEREIS say, that as he means, in the section of Warszawa, Kowno
Riga and Libau about 10 MILLION people have been murdered.
(ZIEEEIS DIED on Thursday, 24th May 45, in the afternoon in
Gusen Camp Hosptial.)﻿Record of the Statements taken from the previous commander of
Concentration carhps Mauthausen - Gusen ~ linzj etc,
SS - Standouterfuhrer Franz ZIEKEIS.
I, Franz Zicreis born 13.7.1905 in Muchen', ray Father was killed
in the first world war, ny Mother is living in Muchen.
I have.one brother Rudolf 38 years old, steam'engine machinist,
and two sisters Mdrgarete 47 years old and Wilhelraine 32 years old, I am
a merchant by profession. During ray longer unemployment I have worked as
a carpenter.
My military service from 1.4.24 to 30,9.36, in the Bavarian Regi-
ment, with the rank of Sergeant. I left the Army with the rank of Lieut-
enant, and I' came to the SS on August 30th 1936 in the rank of Oberstum-
fuhrer and I assigned to the 4th Standarts S*3 in Oranienburg as a teacher
- reported - Schooling the SS men,
I came; to Mauthausen on 17.11.39 as a follower of the previous
camp commander, Sauer. My quick-career I owe to the facts that I have often
reported myself to the front service as volunteer but the commanding officer
of the SS Reichfuhrer Himmler compelled me to'remain as a camps commander
at Mauthausen. The proportion of SS troops to the number of prisoners was
1. to 10.	(I
The highest number of prisoners in the camp Mauthausen was 17,000
.besides the other camps. The highest number of prisoners in other camps
iexcluding Mauthausen was 76,000 prisoners, and the total reached up to
95,000. The number of deaths reached over 65,000 prisoners. The number
of SS troops reached up5 to 5,000 men they were so called "Totenkopfverbande"
(Dead - Head - Units) they were divided into sections of guards and command-
staff. The rest of S3 over 6,000 men came from the army- air-forces (Luft-
waffe) clad in SS imiforms and from many groups so called "Volksdeutschger".
The prisoners of German nationality were also assigned to the
SS troops about 450 men, according to orders given by Himmler. These
prisoners should have to fight against the enemy and especially Bolsheviks.
They Y/ere in the greatest part volunteers, the remaining part Y/as compelled
by the commanders without my knowing.
The orders to burn all documents of the prisoners wore given in
the last days of April (.1945) and in the first days of May, and were given
by the Office D & D) in ®erlin by Groupleader SS Glucks. The orders to
murder the prisoners v/ere given by SS Reichefuhrer Himmler. During his
visit in Mauthausen the Himmler himself gave orders that the prisoners
should carry big stones 45 - 50 kg each - shewing how to kill them.
Personally I have murdered many hundreds of prisoners perhaps
about 400 by sending them to the company of penalty. (Strafkompanie) where
every night were many tortured and killed according to orders from Berlin,
I have personally participated in the executions.
In 1940 the 320 Poles from Yfersaw were massacred by orders re-
ceived from Grupenfuhrer Mayerich. Several times I had to shoot to the ‘
prisoners because the new SS troops (Volksdeutshe) shot bad from the small
fire-ams. To shoot from small fire-arms ordered the Grux^penfuhrer SS
Gluck. In the camp Sachsenhausen there Was installed by his order a shooting
stand, where the prisoners-were killed unexpectedly'by shooting them from
the rear (Genuchschuss),while at the sarat time loud-speaker wireless was
going at its highest.
By the order of Hauptstumfuhror Lohnauer and Dr. Renault were
sent "incorrigible criminals of profession" as "insanes" at Hartheim near
Linz, where they were annihilated by a special investion of Dr, Krobsbach,﻿~ 2 -
Tho majority of the murdered first few thousand prisoners were
k. .led by S3 Hauptsturmfuhre'r Bachmayer in the Camp Mauthausen, Likewise
and.even many were killed by Campfuhrer Soidler at Cusen. The Seidler and
Chmielewski had the skin (from the murdered bodies) prepared and made into
satchels, lamp-covers, bookcovers, etc. I did not prepare anything for
me because it was forbidden by Berlin.
The "action K" consisted of prisoners, who could not be in
contact with anybody and were annihilated by the order of Himmler. The
first Camp Gusen commander Chmielewski has murdered few thousand prisoners,
I an not responsible for the above, because the orders were given by Berlin,
I was not shareholder of Best and. only because of certain functions I have
received 300 marks monthly from Best and 600 M monthly as a campfuhrer. I
did not have other income. Hunting did not cost men anything because it
was given me free of charge. The avionette did not cost me anything because
it was given me. Furthermore, I have received orders to kill all prisoners
Gusen I and II by blasting the tunnels in the air (Kellerbau) at the time
when the prisoners would be in, and in the case when the Hessian Amy
should come near. In case when the USA Army should come first prisoners were
to be let loose. In Febr, 1945 the 3S Gruppenfuhror Pohl had given instruct^
ions to drive the prisoners into the woods in order to have them murdered
in different ways, and by certain means and that in case when war would be
lost to 'Gemany. My wife was shocked, and used her influence on me so that
I began to ignore Berlin. I have recognised the orders from Berlin as stupid,
but it cost me much of ray nerves. Mauthausen - Gusen were the last camps to
which fere evacuated Buchenwald, Bachau, Oswiecim, etc. Thousands of
prisoners were sent to us unexpectedly, mdn, women and children, and there
was no food for them. I have asked Berlin to forbid this cruelty and them
my srperiors critisised me. In every transport the number of dead was
600. - goo of prisoners, Shortly before the end of war they sent from Bachau
a transport of 4,800 prisoners and from this number arrived 180 prisoners,
the others had died from starvation on the way because they, received no
food. In the latest days just before the end of the war the crematorium
crews from Mauthausen, Gusen were murdered by the S3 Hauptsturmfuhrer Bachmeyer
because they knew too much. Continuing his statements Zioreis has mentioned
many names of high S3 persons among them the Gaulieter of Upper Austria
Eigruber. For the last time I have met Himmler it was at Vienna 7 “ 8 weeks
ago. I believe that he hides himself somewhere in Czechoslovakia. In
reply to my question if he realized that the war is lost for Germany, he
said "Yes", How I see - the devastation which was accomplished by one stupid
man Hitler on the 80’ millions of German people, and the results.
At this point the interrogation came to end because of his
weakness and difficulties in speaking. Franz Ziereis gave the above state-
ments laying in bed, being seriously wounded by two shots one in the stomach
and’one in the left shoulder.
To all questions asked him in German by two lnterrigen.ee confi-
dents he answered consciously and without compelling him to do so.﻿﻿K. den 22* Mai 194-5

(400 Haftlinge^ Unter erbarmlichen Schikanen und Gemeinkeiten warden
die Inkaftierten jeden Morgen auf die ca. 6 km entfernt liegende Arbeits-
stelle getrieben. Dort angekommen mussten bei 21 Grad Kalte die Mantel,
Jacken,Okrensckiitzer und Handschuke abgelegt warden. Nur Menscken mit
eiserner Gesundkeit und einem festen,fast ubernattirlicken Willen kielten
durck.Am Abend wurden die Sterbenden und Toten wie Sekweine auf Lastwagen
verladen und in das Lager liberfukrt,wakrend der nock lebende Rest in
einem weit auseinander gezogenen Elendszug folgte. Die Zakl 400 wurde
immer wieder ersetzt.
Das grauenkafteste Bild bot die sogenannte "Isolierung"! Alles, was
effektiv nickt mekr kriecken konnte, wurde dieser Abteilukg zugefukrt.

sick die Toten, die unter Umstanden 2—5 Tage liegen mussten bevor sie ab—
gekolt wurden. Es war keine Seltenheit, dass Ratten in der Nackt die Leicken
anfrassen--------
Das geringste Vergeken_wurde mit drakoniseken Strafen geakndet. Wer z.B*
fur einen Augenblick die Hacke oder Sckaufel aus der Hand legte und dabei
gefasst wurde,katte am folgenden Freitag zum Strafvollzug anzptreten*
Zum Strafvollzug wurden stets 2 besonders beruektigte Sadisten(SS-Manner)
bestimmt.Der zu Bestrafende musste sick iiber einen besonders konstruierten
Bock legen: das Gesass kock, Hande und Fiisse festgekrallt.Dann wurde mit
einem Oehsenziemer auf den Unglucklicken losgedroscken(25 Hiebe und mekr)
In den meisten Fallen sassen die Hiebe zu kock,sodass die Nieren getroffen
wurden. Es ist sekr oft vorgekomnen, dass sick die armen Menscken losrij/ssen
und in ikrer Qual in den elektrisck geiadenen Zaun rannten um Rutee und
Frieden zu finden. Und dock war dies® Strafart nock nickt die Furcktbarste!
ms gab Scklimmeres: das sogenannte "Baumkangen"! Dem Haftling wurden die
Hande bezw.Arme auf dem Riicken mit einem Strick zusammengebunden.Dann musste
er sick auf einen Stukl stellen.Die Arme wurden nack oben gebogen, der Striclt
uber einen Balkan geworfen und es wurde so lange gezogen, bis der Betreffendj
irei king. Durch die Sehwere des Korpers zogen sick die Stricke tief in die
Arme und Hande ein, nack 10-15 Minuten waren die Schultergelenke ausgekugelt﻿3.

waren etwa 800—1000 Haftlinge aufgesckrieken, ifiemand kannte vorlaufig

caught and brought to justice.
g	Kj name is.Ksrl WEBFR , born on the C7th /ugust 1907 t-t
R/kf CH1ID, Rhineland. I s » member of the n£taihelir,t Orgsnisstion. The
Organ!satica's poiicj was German National on Democratic Monarchical lines.
The Stalhela organisation was suppressed in 1935. I am a journalist,
married, and since 19Z2 lived in Hamburg, the native city of kj wife. My
’.-ife became '» member of the Lufteaffe in 1940. Hep last' out; w%» inspectress,
'f the Y.omen'e iluxiliar; Force in Denmark. Dui'ing the past six months I
ave not hao news of her. M; . son, Haas'- Hermaan WEEER-, 11 yrscs old was at
a Homeschool at UCKiRllliK, E-. rlia, and I have had no news of him.
On the morning of fro Sept. *89 I was arrested at G700 hrs
two Gestapo agents, in' my own flat. I was infoi'aed that I was s danger
the btatfe during tho war, and was taken to a Concentration Camp, /fte.r •
week, on the 10th Dept., I was taken along with another 1C6 prisoners
the prison at Berlin to the Camp at Mauthausen, where, we arrived
* three aays. There commenced a period of suffering and misery. Words
t express the conditions existing within the wails of Mauthausen
tratlon Camp. Mauthausen was an extermination Camp and as such will
. in history as a memorial to Nazi bestiality.
» '
At the time of my arrival there were only German prisoner?
.authausen, and ao v.e saw ' the first ve *new precisely what fate was
to be ours. Along the Camp pazhs there were no human beings, but hoilow-
gy.ed and starved creatures staggering around, living painfully from day to
day. Untersturmfuhrer LCHULZ, in charge of the Political department,
Kicked and otherwise ill treated, every one. Orb arrival the prisoners' hair
w^s shaved off s,nd therf were dressed in striped prison clothes. Then they
wire put in one or- the other of the two Barracks. These Barracks were
Fuilt to house 140 prisoners but 800 were squeezed- in each. The Camp
quarry was the most important"working .place. Here the prisoners worked
under the most terrible conditions from 0700. hrs till. 0000 hrs dally. The
ration was 1/d kilo of breaa end 8/4 litre of water soup. The death, roll
mounted up daily, and the Camp Commander, S.Bjt, Btandsrdenfuhrer Franz 7.TFE
EIS, wi&s obviously pleased to announce this. He lived on the Mauthausen""
estate. In the quarry the prisoners were killed in the following way
They were forced tc climb & stone stfirwsy of about 160 steps carrying
stones weighing•50 or 60 Kgs.(others were thrown in the river and held
under the ms sr until they drowned. The official term to cover these deaths
was "Yoluntail-efu:.iciae.n Many prisoners preferred to run ever the bound-
ary chain and were shot by the sentries. This was termed: "Shot while
trying to escape. J.>ws lived a very short time. On arrival in Camp their
possessions were pis, ndered by the Guards and they were exterminated in the •
following way:- in ti is quarry was a rocky about 15 to 20 metres long and
the exhausted^ Jews suwe driven over the quarry edge in groups of 8 or 10
"t f time, all holdi ng hands, onto this rock aboibt 50 metres below. They
called this form-of death the "parachute hunt." Broken limbs and pieces"
of train were scattered over the extent of this rock and other prisoners ,
sere made tb collect the pieces and carry them to the Crematorium. This﻿Kg- T’j Q. . .
Tu, J ■
v.ss not exceptions!, the killings were done thoroughly tnd cslicly. Dur-
ing the Y.inter of 19S9 - L940 I v,«s sent to the ^Lsgerfcufbs-u Gusen”
prison, where there were 400 prisoners. The cruelty meted out here wss
horrible, every morning the prisoners were sent 6 kms to the piece of
work. On *rrivfel they were made to remove coats, jackets, ear protectors,
and glove? in a temperature of il degrees below Zero. Only the strongest
and firmest billed could hope to survive. In the evening the dying and
the dead were heaped on a lorry like animals and taken back to Camp. The
survivors went back on foot, replacements kept the prisoner strength at
a constant 400.
The most aresdau punishment pas the ’’Isolation". Everyone who
could still creep was sent into this section, where they were separated
by a high barbed wire fence from thorest. Even in the coldest, part of
Vinter all winnows were removed, and th® prisoners huddled close togeth-
er on the stinking straw for warmth. Broken in body:and spirit, ana
without medics 1 attention, they came .elos.e to death. That ras the "Isol-
ation Section." In ,the .lavatories the dead were heaped up : nd sometimes
•remained.two or three days.before they were removed. It was not uncommon
for rats to start eating the bodies,
. - The least- fault was soverly punished. ,Those "Who put down- their
shovel .or hoe were punished on the following Friday by two famous sadist
S-.S. men specially appointed.V Ter v •.ctIn vt:s mad© to lie on « specially
constructed chair T 1th their buttocks raised up and their hands, and...feet
were tied down. They were given 85 or more strokes with j whip, the
blows usually falling too high so that the kidney? v.r.re struck. Often.
the prisoner? were sllbwed to. free thor.selves, ' nd preferred to run onto
the electrically charged fencing, the're to find surcease from their
pain. This was not, however, the worst of the punishments inflicted.
A worse one w«s celled the "Tree hanging." The -prisoners a ms were tied
behind with rope while the prisoner stood, on a chair. Then the rope was
thrown over a besm, and tightened until the prisoners were hanging free.
The weight of the body made the rope .cut'into the trites, '-and often dis-
located the shoulder blades, the- hands mo 'arms, became swollen. The
tormentors walked, in front of the prisoners laughing -and smoking. Some'
times to add weight they would swing on the feet of the victims, while
sweat and blood ran. down to the ground. When the prisoners fainted they
were revived by a cold shower* Often after this o'r&etl they were unable t
to .move s finger for weeks and had to be fed like babies, kt the begin-
ning of-194.1 I was • appointed block Writer, and shortly after that. Camp
writer. A*'such.I was in a responsible position, and could ease in a
small way the.misfortunes of some of the nameless prisoners. It the
beginning of 1948 the period of shooting commenced. On an average. TO •
Poles were shot each evening. These pi-is oners Were taken during the
afternoon, fror thetr work..and In the evening were- killed by shooting as
they marched along. This continued for several weeks, and there were
streams of blood at the place of execution, 'behind the workshops. In
spite of all this, the extermination machine was not running quickly
enough.
A plan was, therefore, devised- without ps.rilisl in history. At
noon on parade the prisoners were ordered to remain in place. The Com-
mander and about 15 civilians arrived*.nd walked round the parade scrutini
ising the men. Every third or fourth prisoner v,>s called out and the
Commander had a few words with him. He was then made to go back to his
place in the line, or was called to one side where the Politics! Dept,
took his name and number. In the front line they always put the oldest
prisoners: the weak and the undesirable prisoners came in for special
consideration, for they had seen too much. This parade lasted until
1800 hrs by which time about 800 people had been specially listed. No-
body knew the reason for this. One day, soon after that, the first 70 pn.﻿?; r.e Three.
I'irst 70/
pi oners, .«e«ring shirts «ad pants were taken #»*j in s covered lorry^	. .
The next daj a second party of 70 prisoners was despatched, and so oh
daily' for the next tv.o and a half recks. Later the shirts and pants vere •
brought back, but no prisoners returned. Later it came to be known that
every prisoner had been gassed in the ex - asyluas of IBBS. In the official
documents the deaths were recorded as;- T.B., Paralysis of the heart, or
jsppeddicitis. Feanrhile the rooms of the fpedal Dept, in the prison had
been prepared, so it ns no longer necessary to. send prisoners sway. The
mass murder started being performed in a modern gas chamber furnished
like e bathroom. Below the ru.eeylion rooms •;ere built what' we called the
Necks hot” rooms. The department was now working at a high speed, and
nightly trsnsports arrived from everywhere, Germans, Poles end Czechs,
these latter being connected with the Ileydrich affair.- There were also
women who soon after they were arrested were shot, but later on, to avoid
a sensation, they were also gassed. The 'poor victims ••♦.ore taken *tb have
k bath,” t^hey. received towels and soap,-'then they wore taken to this
certain room”, and the doors rere locked, fils nee -followed.
Later the «lsol*fionn problvE developed along Ingenious lines.
On a. certain day the whole block was raided and from every cell six sick
prisoners were taker, they were all g* seed. About DO orisoners were
murdered in » special >ay. This wes by the invention of Dr.. £.8. fturmbsnn
fuhrer KBIBBBACK. The victims were brought in sms'll groups of SO to the
Camp hospital. They were'‘tola that their bandages were going to be changed.
Only . one* or is i" nor at a time'fcent into the dressing rotas,- sM bsc told to'
lie dorr as if to be exsRl ied; Theh or. SREPSBIC1- cswe end t^-ok .delight
in stabbing the prisoner to' tee heart with a long injection needle. This
caused immediate .death. One after the other the prisoners were killed in
this sadistic manner. Deter again this method of killing wss dropped and
t mere "Humane* one was -dopted. The victims were drugged with ether and
afterwards murdered with $ petrol injection. Thousands of Germans, Poles Cz
Czechs, Slovenes «nd Tews., were killed in this manner./pert from Dr. KBFB-
SBiCH there was a certainpenitatsunterschar-ffubrer CtTTO KLFIfGTMTHFB from
Vienna, -end lastly S.^. Reids.rbeiterleitstelle BFBLIS - LXCBTPRFFL0 ’ho
was res pons thief or this latter killing.. Be derived pleasure from killing
8-10 people daily. The most ingenious device was Invented by the Com-
mander himself. A hermetically sealed iorry.was laden with prisoners ’ho
were- to be killed, and then he took over the wheel of the vehicle.
Through s smell'hole h« threw « get bomb .into the interior of the lorry
where the victims were enclosed, und then be drove off. /fter about an bom
he unloaded his .dead victims at the Crematorium, /beat 25000 to bG.OOC
persons were killed s-'t aruthsusen from. IP TP tc 1947. fpen prisoners tried
to escape the police in the arcs wore notified. The capture cf the pris-
oner was important only in so far «s> if,he gained bir liberty, he bould
tell too much. Very few prisoners ituasged to escape. Then the fugitive
was caught the whole .Camp t-j-s assembled and the band play ed a welcome
march. The prisoner wes made to ci*ll out;" Good day. Friends, I am back
• gaina” jt gallows was erected in front of the assembled prisoners and
soon everything was over. One case 1 reaenber ’•■hen « dead - fugitive w-ss
exposea to everyone tied on «n open coffin. The bund war ordered tc play
a Tango, and later six comrades were made to take the body to the Crem-
atorium.
To all these horrors was added the prisoners brothel which was
set up in 194IE. One day 14 women were brought Trom the women's Concen-
tration Camp at R/.ifENSBBDCK, Mecklenburg. One block was transformed and
s regular brothel was started. For 60 Fgs. every prisoner had the opport-
unity of losing the last remnant of his selfrespect.
Ihen visitors were expected, .particularly chosen prisoners were
ordered to stay in groups near the Model block. They were made to chat
together and smoke and sit at little tables reading or playing Bkst or

Concentration camps Mauthausen - Gusen - Linz, etc,
SS - Standanterfuhrer Franz ZIEKEIS.
I, Franz Ziereis born 13.7.1905 in Muchen, my Father was killed
in the first world war, ray Mother is living in Muchen,
I have one brother Rudolf 38 years old, steam engine maohihist,
and two sisters Margarete 47 years old and Vilhelraine 32 years old, I am
a merchant by profession. During my longer unemployment I have worked as
a carpenter.
My military service from 1.4.24 to 30.9.36, in the Bavarian Regi-
ment, with the rank of Sergeant, I left the Army with the rank of Lieut-
enant, and I came to the SS on August 30th 1936 in the rank of Oberstum-
fuhrer and I assigned to the 4th Standarts S^ in Oranienburg as a teacher
- reported - Schooling the 88 men.
I came; to Mauthausen on 17.11.39 as a follower of the previous
camp commander, Sauer. My quick-career I owe to the facts that I have often
reported myself to the front service as volunteer but the commanding officer
of the SS Reichfuhrer Himmler compelled me to remain as a camps commander
at Mauthausen, The proportion of'SS troops to the number of prisoners was
1. to 10.
The highest number of prisoners in the camp Mauthausen was 17,000
.besides the other camps. The highest number of prisoners in other camps
(excluding Mauthausen was 76,000 prisoners, and the total reached up to
95,000. The number of deaths reached over 65,000 prisoners,. The number
of SS troops reached up to 5*000 men they were so called "Totenkopfverbande"
(Dead - Head - Units) they were divided into sections of guards and command-
staff. The rest of 3S over 6,000 men cane from the army- air-forces (Luft-
waffe) clad in SS jijnttro'rms and from many "gm.'Ups so called "Yalksdeutschgei."
The prisoners of German nationality were also assigned to the
SS troops about 450 men, according to orders given by Himmler.' These
prisoners should have to fight against the enemy and especially Bolsheviks.
They were in the greatest poart volunteers, the remaining part was compelled
by the commanders without my knowing.
The orders to burn all documents of the prisoners were given in
the last days of April (.1945) and in the first days of May, and were given
by the Office D & D) in ^erlin by .Groupleader SS Glucks. The orders to
murder the prisoners were given by SS Reichefuhrer Himmler. During his
visit in Mauthausen the Himmler himself gave orders that the prisoners
should carry big stones 45 - 50 kg each - showing how to kill them.
Personally I have murdered many hundreds of prisoners perhaps
about 400 by sending them to the company of penalty. (Strafkorrrpanie) where
every night were many tortured and killed acoording to orders from Berlin.
I have personally participated in the executions.
In 1940 the 320 Poles from Warsaw were massacred by orders re-
ceived from Grupenfuhrer Mayerich. Several times I had to shoot to the
prisoners because the new SS troops (Volksdeutshe) shot bad from the small
fire-arms. To shoot from small fire-arms ordered the Grupponfuferer SS
Gluck. In the camp Sachsenhausen there Was installed by his order a shooting
stand, where the prisoners were killed' unexpectedly by shooting thera from
the rear (Genuchschuss),while at the samt time loud-speaker wireless was
going at its highest.
By the order of Hauptsturmfuhrer Lohnauer and Dr. Renault were
sent "incorrigible criminals of profession" as "insanes" at Hartheim near
Linz, where they were annihilated by a special investion of Dr. Krobsjaach.
/ 2 «.... 4﻿2 -
J. .

The majority of the murdered first few(Thousand prisoners were
killed by S3 Hauptoturmfuhrer Bachraayer in the Gamp Mauthausen, Likewise
and even many were killed by Campfuhrer Soidler at Cusen. The Seidler and
Chraielewski had the skin .(from the murdered bodies) prepared and made into
satchels, lamp-covers, bookcovers, etc. I did not'prepare anything for
me because it was forbidden by Berlin.
The "action K" consisted of prisoners, who could not be in
■contact with anybody and were annihilated by the order of Himmler. The
first Camp Gusen commander Chraielewski has murdered.few thousand prisoners.
I am not responsible for the above, because the orders were, given by Berlin.
I was not shareholder of Best and only because of certain functions I have
received 300 marks monthly from Best and 600 M monthly as a campfuhrer. I
did not have other income. Hunting did-not cost men anything because it
was given me free of charge. The avionette did not cost me anything because
it was given me. Furthermore, I have received orders to kill all prisoners
Gusen I and II by blasting the tunnels in the air (Kellerbau) at the time
when J-he prisoners would bo in, and in the case when the Russian Army
should come near. In case when the USA Army should come first prisoners were
to be let loosed In Febr. 1945 the SS' Gruppenfuhrer Pohl had given instruct-
ions to drive the prisoners into the woods in order to have them murdered
in different ways, and by certain means and that in case when war would be
lost to Germany. My wife was shocked, and used her influence on me So that
I began to ignore Berlin. I have recognised the orders from Berlin as stuxaid,
but it cost me much of my nerves. Mauthausen - Gusen were the last camps to
which Were evacuated Buchenwald, Bachau, Oswiecim, etc. Thousands of
prisoners were sent to us unexpectedly, men, women and children, and there
was no food for them. I have asked Berlin to forbid this cruelty and them
my superiors critisized me. In every transport the number of dead was
60© - 800 of prisonous, °hor~51/ before the' end of War they sent from Dachau
a transport of 4*800-prisoners and from this number arrived 180 prisoners,
the others had died from starvation on the way because they received no
food. In the latest days just before the end of the war the crematorium
crews from Mauthausen, Gusen were murdered by the SS Hauptstumfuhrer Bachmeyer
because they knew too much. Continuing his statements Zicreis has mentioned
many names of high S3 persons among them the Gaulieter of 4pper Austria
Eigruber. For the last time I have met Himmler it was at Vienna 7-8 weeks
ago. I believe that he hides himself somewhere in Czechoslovakia. In
reply to my question if he realized that the war is lost for Germany, he
said "Yes", How I see - the devastation which was accomplished by one stupid
man Hitler on the 80 millions of German x^eorale, and the results.
At this xeoint the interrogation came to end because of his
weakness and difficulties in speaking. Franz Ziereis gave the qbove state-
ments laying in bed, being seriously 'wounded by two shots one in the stomach
and one in the left shoulder.
To all questions asked him in German by two Interrigence confi-
dents he answered consciously and without compelling him to do so.﻿#
V	On 23rd of May 1945; about 18 o'clock I was Wounded near the
cottage of PRIN, near Spital by iknerioan Soldiers while trying to escape
them. My name is FRANZ ZIEREIS, born 13 August 1905. I was commander-in-
chief of Lager Mathausen and the other camps depending' on that comp. I
got shot through the left upper arm and also in the back. The gun-bullet
went through the center and came out the other side. I had been brought to
the 131st (US) Evac Hosp at Cusen and 1 Want to declare as follows:
According to the order of Reichminister HIMMLER I had to kill
aH the prisoners wing to a statement of Obergruppenfuhrer Dr. KALTEKBRUNNER.
Tne prisoners had to be put in a tunnel, the doors of that tunnel had to be
closed with stones and cement in advance and then the hole had to be blown up
with dynamite. I refused to obey this order. I understand the prisoners of
Lager Gusen I and II to be liquidated by this processing. All details above
that are known to Mr. WOLFRAM and Oberstumfuhrer ECKERMANN. The latter was
working in BERGERISTALL.
In Mauthausen camp a gas-room was built according to an order of
1 SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Dr. KHEBSBACH. That room had been built similar to the
•bath room here. In this room the prisoners had been gassed. Besides that
a special motor-car was running between Mauthausen and Gusen in which
prisoners had been gassed also. The chemist SS-Unterstumfuhrer YfASICKI
gave this ear for this purpose. I had perfectly known that prisoners had
been gassed during the travel. The gassing was done on pressure of the
doctor, SS-Haupstumfuhrer Dr. B. KREBSBACH, who must be actually in Kassel.
Ho has been eliminated from the S3, because he had been Free-Mason and played
with double-face. On all the prisoners we had liquidated orders came from the
Reich-Sicherheitshauptamt or from HIMMLER or from HELDRICH or from G-ruppen-
fuhrer MULLER or even from Dr. KALE EH-RE CHEER, chief of the Sicherheitspolizei
4 know nothing at all about the last 800 prisoners having been
Killed Jjxjjusqk, IIMhy—s-tiaka->miioaea-GE_]aay:incf„hiaQfL.4ng!f!mi,. LL-gaye sot-fcbs-_
orders for such a killing. Furthermore, I. know nothing at all about the
gassing of 640 prisoners in Gusen I on ward Wo, 31 by German prisoners FIEGEL,
AMEGONG (already dead) and LIESBERG, the blockmaster from Ward 15, according
toan order from the ^ uomraander of camp (SEIDLER) and Rapportfuhrer GILLEMMN
on coindition that, if the German prisoners are not willing to execute that
order they never would go alive through the great door.
1 donot know about the whereabouts of Oberscharfuhrer JENT30N, who
killed in camp Guseri I about 700 prisoners by the manner that he let them
stand naked, spraying ice-cold water on them at 12° frost, several hours
outdoors, I do not know the refuge of SS-Untersturmfuhrer Dr. WIDESEWETTER
vnio murdered several hundred prisoners by intravenous injections with gaso-
line, hydrogen (ifOccra), Caliumsulphurioum 25 Eunarcon and Evipan.
Dr. RICHTER, who murdered several hundred prisoners by operating
on i/hem without any reason and cut away the brain, stomach, spleen	or
other iarfceriors, was sent by me to canp Gunzkirchen with the order, to take
care of? the prisoners in that camp.
I know absolutely nothing that Untersturmfuhrer MEEROV, who was
in Pagau, shot 15 sick prisoners,
4 know very well that all cruelties by beating prisoners with
a'stick were forbidden by Berlin, but nevertheless I myself have beaten them
for merely sadism.
Oborgruppenfuhrer POHL gave order to chase sick prisoners, who
Y/ere noc entitles to get food in the camp, in the forests where they had to
food themselves by fruits, berries, etc. He cut down the daily rations of
750 grams to 350' grams per vreek and in the last 12 days we had neither bread
nor meat.
/ 2﻿2
Gruppenfuhrer GLUCKS Jjave orders to sign sick prisoners as
stricken by mental derangements and to gas them. About OWE MILLION and a
HALF have been murdered in this way. The gas-room lies in Hartheim near Linz
in the direction to Passau, 10 klmtrs. from Emz.
But in this camp such gassed prisoners have been reported as
normal dead. The statements of such killed prisoners were already made out
when still alive, or on transport, this done by the administrative section of
Gusen camp.
I want to be confronted with HIMMLER and Obergruppenfuhrer GLUCK
POHL and GLUECK must be actually in SANCT LAMBEECHC in the Crevezen Cottage
(that is about 4 hours up in the hills).
The gas-room in Mauthausen has been built on order of Gruppen-
fuhrer GLUECK as he supposed that it is more human to gas pjeople than to
liquidate them by shooting.
One day, without former information, Obergruppenfuehrer POHL
Sent a transport of 6,000 women and children, all having been without food
for 10 days on transport. They had been on the railway in open oattle-
carriages, without blankets, in December 1943, in an icy cold. According to
an order received from- Berlin, I had to send the children immediately to
Bergen-Belsen comp and I suppose they all died a dreadful death. This was
a reason for my break-down of nerves.
Another transport of 2,.500 prisoners came from Aushwitz camp to
-Mauthausen and-hadr-iitw-be spnayed-vrlth--said mter.-ia-.w.i3ateit.."on..the--j(q^teXU=-•.
place I had to send these prisoners tt> Gusen camp, away of about 5 klmtrs.,
and we had no clothes for them besides underwear, I asked for clothes for
the prisoners, but I got the reply from Berlin, to send them naked to Gusen
if no clothes are available, I sent them along in underwear. Such cases
happened at several times.
Gauleiter EIGRUBER has forbidden all food for new-arriving or
sick prisoners, he gave even order that 50% of the potatoes having already
prepared for the necessities of the camp had to be handed over to the
civilians.
Gruppenfuehrer GLUECK was that man who gave the order that the
whole staff having been working in the Mauthausen crematoria had to be sent
to Gusen camp where they had to be liquidated by shooting in the neck for
the only reason because some of them had been already working in Auschwitz
crematoria and could have given information about' these crematorias.
There was a secret order that the staff of the crematoria had
to be liquidated every three weeks. It concerned all prisoners without any
exception who worked in the crematoria. There was also an* order to
liquidate all doctors having been Working in the hospital. I refused to do
so. This order was given by SS-Standartenfuehrer LOLLING to all SS-doctors.
But I had forbidden and prevented this order when it was made public.
Furthermore all prisoners who had a job in the hospital had to be brought
into other camps in order to be liquidated (from Mauthausen). But Dr .WALTER,
who has been chief Medicine of S3 in Mauthausen, refused .the execution of
this order. He must be in ?	and I was told that he has got the
fleck-fever.
’When I was Commandant of Mauthausen, the following camps were
attached also:

I had some more cartrps under my authority, about 45, I do not
remember fcfte exact number.
Very interesting was the Schlier camp, where all workers were
Jewish graphics or lithographs (about a thousand) They printed false
foreign banknotes, passports, permits, etc. of the whole world.
Transports of Jews: In presence of Gauleiter RALKER., Dr.
UESERRLITER, Dr. JURY, Baldir von SCHIRACIi and others I got the following
order from HD/MLER: All the Jews firom all the localities in the Southeast,
working in the so-called fortification-commands have to go (walk) by foot
to Mauthausen camp. 60,000 Jews according to this order were expected
in Mauthausen camp., but only a little fraction arrived indeed. I remember
that a transport of 4,500 Jews left somewhere, in the country, but only 180
arrived in Mauthausen. Women and children had been without shoes, clothes
and completely full up with lice. In that transport were complete families
when leaving, but an enormous number had been killed on the way while weak,
sick, etc. ZIBHEIS states that owing to his wits, the Jews having been
lodged in the so-called tent-camp Mauthausen had a human life and treatment
nearly no deaths, the Jews got good food, a rest, and then only they had
been sent to Gunzkirchen camp, Zierois suggested witness: the Czecho-
slovakian prisoner Dr, Prof. PR0HASKA, with whom he had many interviews to
always improve the living of the Jews. (Thereupon was stated by prisoner
Dr. Tonia: Just in the tent-camp the Jews died on masse, when ZIEREIS speaks
■ about a human treatment and living, this must be called a nasty arrogancy,
j Only on one transport of 5,000 Jews leaving Mauthausen to Gunzkirchen, a
l distance of 4 klmtrs. - Mauthausen carapj to railway bridge Mauthausen - 800
'shot bodies of Jews had been counted. Several trucks had to be ordered to
Wove the bodies.

Hmks. in another Mauthausen bank. He says that he never had gold, diamonds,
jewels, dollars or other money. All letters he got from HIMMLER have been
burnt also the orders, photos.
The paymaster, SS-man BISENHOMER, took all the money with him.
Messersohmidt factories, according to t^e confession of ZIEREIS,
paid a daily sum of 8.“Rmks for each prisoner to the chief-administration
in Oranieriburg-Berlin, but the prisoner himself got only 50 Pfgs. a day.
ZIEREIS was ashamed of this corruption, and energitacally requested aa
consultation with the heads of Nazism. Quote: "I will throw the full
truth into their face about all those betrayers and murders". "I was no
student, I was .a simple soldier and I have got this post owing to my own
will, energy and hard work I "
Whorehouse: In Mauthausen existed a whorehouse, ^every man had
to pay 2.—Bmks, the woman got 50 pfgs, and the HQ of the Concentration
Camps in Oranienburg-Berlin got 1,50 Rmks., I mean POHL got the money I

has beaten them and abused them. He directed his own "beer-news". Later on
he was sentenced to 15 years, hard labour, but the judgment has not been
confirmed by the Reichsfuehrer. His successor in Holland was SS-Stum-

allowed to write the following letter:
Gusen, 24.5.1945.
My dear wife,
I had been found (23rd of.May 1945) by the Americans while you have
been out shopping, I laid ny machine-gun behind a tree, about 4 mtrs. away
from the cottage, in the direction which leads along the riven to Liezen. I
ask you, my dear, to come with the children to Gusen, call at Dr. GOSCHINSKX.
You may be submitted to an interview and I ask you to say the full truth,
namely give a full statement about the conduct of the heads .in Berlin. Further-
more give these gentlemen knowledge of our decision to go both into death to
enable our children a better life. When arrested, I lost my nerves. I laid
my machine-gun by the tree instead of using it, as I am known as a master of
the rifle. The Americans showed perfect conduct, but they prevented ray
flight by means of arms, I«,had been shot twice and I could not rise, I am
now in the American Hospital in Gusen Camp. I have said everything I had
known, as far as it was possible with the heavy Y/ounds I have. I have some
more details to relate, especially about the dirty conduct of gentlemen in
Berlin, including the Reichsfuehrer, Please come and let know everybody here
how they treated us miserably. Tell the gentlemen about the swinish conduct of
Obergruppenfuehrer PQHL.
Your loving husband
Signi Franz.
About 'dissolving the farm' 3d. haraldfe'ciTt-'c6miflaAd''"21S®l3'JstatB^4ig"“'
follows: the administration of this farm was in the hands of a Standarten-
fuchrer from Munich, who, together with POHL and some women, often held
exciting festivals in St. Lambrecht; but the prisoners were in;their v/ay
and therefore they resolved to denouce the prisoners claiming that had stolen
the.farm and;that they prepared an attempt of flight. The command v/as
dissolved according to an order from Mauthausen camp heads and the prisoners
have been brought back to the camp. ZIEEEIS states that he got the order to
liquidate them at once on arrival in order to have no witnesses about the
doings in St. Lambrecht. A part of these prisoners had been "chased into
the eletric vfiring", another part was torn by BACHMEIER's dog Lord. Again
another one was sent to Gusen camp for hard labour.
Execution of 38 Austrians on 2gth -^pril 1945
ZIEEEIS oannot state the reason for the execution of the 38
Austrians sitting already more than one year in Mauthausen comp. He only
can Say that according to an idea of Gauleiter EIGRUBER, Dr.^PFIFFRATER and
the head of the Linz-Gestapo APANN this execution has been done. To survey
theexecution itself a certain PROCHASKA, agent for the Gestapo, had been
charged. It is said that the execution vras done by this man with two
Blockfuehrers from Mauthausen camp, I,n this matter I must confess, it is
exact that the PROCHASKA and a Gestapo-employee POECHER from the Linz-
Gestapo brought up to Mauthausen the order for the execution.
(Remarks of the Secretary No, 1 (PAKEX) and No. 2 (MARSAiLEK) of Mauth,
camp:
The execution had to take place in the night from 28th to 29th of
April 1945 on pressure of the head of the political section of Mauthausen camp,
SCHULZ, but it had been jjostponed several times. In the same night about
11 o/clook the famous Haeptseharfuehrer SPATZENEGGER and some other Unter-
scharfuehrcrs demanded the immediate presentation of the delinquents and their
execution. All having been provided with automatic machine-rifles*( not the
prisoners). We, the prisoner-secretaries, refused to do so and stated., that﻿(3	-
we had orders for execution the following morning only. That■order- came from
the Lagerfuohrer ALPULISGH, who really gave us the order for the following
Morning. SPATZEMSGGER and his men strolled away and we informed at^once
the Austrians about the sort awaiting them in the morning. They tried to
escape, but owing to misfortune and treason of other prisoners they were
unsuccessful. Or#; man, called DIETLL, who got refuge in the hospital-camp
Mauthausen. SPATENEGG-ER did not return the next morning, the prisoners had
to call at the secretary about 8 o’clock, they had to stand by the kitchen
until noon, then they were conducted by Oberscharfuehrer NIEDEEMAIER.in a
courtyard where they were murdered by two Blockfuehrers with automatic
machine-guns. PROCHASKA was not present at the execution.
One night in February 1945 an Anglo-American Military Mission from
Croatia, having been alleged connection with TITO, was brought into
Mauthausen Camp. ZIEREIS denied to have been present during such interro-
gations or tortures of the Anglo-Americans, If such cruelties have been
committed against the Anglo- Americans, only on order of BACHMEIER. ZZERLIS
confesses that after the'interrogation of_the Anglo-Americans such trials
have been called in the camp "the Tibetan Prayer", After that, they^have
been brought in a car to Dachau camp, the car has' been driven by a lieutenant
from Berlin, whose name is' unknown to him. When ZIEREIS was told that it was
a lie what he was saying about the Anglo-Americans, he several times stated:
"No, no, they drove away to Dachau". According to statements of ZIEREIt> it
was Criminal Commissar HAMBCHEN, Referat 4., 8/1I5 Reichssicherheits-Hauptamt
Berlin, and Standartenfuehrer GESCHKE, who led the Tibetan Prayer, ( a term
used in the prison camps after the torture of the Anglo-American Mission).
About HEAD RICH ZIEREIS says: all the Czechoslovakians murdered in
"Mauthausen Camp have been oxeenred accordi^^ to nn order from-H.H.TRANK.
Himself was against such a killing en masse (ZIEREIS).
Z3EEEIS says furthermore: I know some details above other comps.
In the year 1941 nil the commanders of all the German concentration camps
have deen ordered to Sachsehhausen-Borlin where we saw.how on the quickest
way the Politrucksand Russina Commisars have been liquidated. In one part
of the ‘Ward the Russians have been gathered and conducted in an execution-
cell, through a dark gangway whilst a wireless was loudly tuning. On the
other side of the cell was a hole in the wall with a mobile rost for.a gun.
When the politrucks or commissars have been liquidated by neck-shootiiig,
all the SS-Fuehrers ©f GLUCK's staff were drunk; the investion of this
killing was made by SS-Oberfuehrer LCE3SZ, The bodies of the.killed
Russians have been thrown outside by two SS-Oberscharfuehrer with an
extraordinary cruelty. - They had eight mobile crematoria which were
constantly in action. The could manage between 1500 to 2000bodies. a day.
I think that the burning kept on for 5 weeks at least. On our arrival in
Sachsenhausen the burning already was going on about a fortnight.
In Gros-Rosen camp the prisoners got Zyancali-solution in the
cardiac veins, by the SS-doctor. There were several SS~docters who changed
permanently. The commander was SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer ARTHUR ROGEL.
In Buchenwald comp I was witness, whilst still staying with the
troops, when there was taken away from Jewish prisoners all their money,
gold, jewels, especially knovm for such robbing was Obersturmfuehrer
IvfACKMANN, Untersturmfuchrer MEYER, a parent of HIMMLER. Everybody.in that
camp got a big car at once. HACKMANN drove out in a cutaway and high hat,
with stolen diamonds on his fingers. MEYER imitated like a monkey all these
manners. The surveyor of Buchenwald arrest calls was also a specialist in
robbing and drove-out drunk, With a naked woman in the car, to Erfurt, where
'he spent in bars 5,000 - a night - of course he paid with stolen money.﻿7
... 7 i-i
v	If I remember well, Obsoharf'uhrer HIESCH, the master of the arrest
cells, has been shot because every escape was impossible. Stumbannfuhrer
KOCH is told to have given himself this advice of suicide. HIRSCH had known
all the details of the commander KOCH. KOCH was syphylitic and got treat-
ment by a prisoner-doctor whom he later on murdered with the help of a SS-
taedecin. With the fortune of the JEWS a big deal was made, a blanket value
Rmks, 2,50 about was sold at Rmks. 100. -
A S^-doctor, Strumbannfuhrer Dr. Kirchner, pschiatic, killed a
great number of prisoners, stating them simply mad. This action, also in
other caaps was officially stated in the reports under No 14 K 13 to prevent
biological disease. Ihe,'prisonsns from Dachau, Buchenwald, and Mauthausen
have been presented a commission from Berlin, whose head was SS-Hauptsturm
fuhrer Dr. LONAUER, who had a clinic in Linz, Heartheim. They have been
reported as mental-inferior and I think that with an average of 20,000 pris-
oners during one year and a half FOUR MILLION must have gassed in that gas-
foora of Dr. L0NAUER nr. Linz. Like Mauthausen, that gas room looked exactly
like a bath-room. The execution was not in the hands of the SS, - Dr.
L0MAUER and pr. REYNAID, but in the hands of officers of the police. I do
not remember the name of the head of the police - he was killed later on in
Croatia. They had been gassed by coaloxyd-gas. The ashes wejre gathered
behind the doctor’s clinic and when the action vns stopped ashes were
loaded on trucks and dumped in the Danube. It is said that HITLER himself
gave the orders to stop this action. His reason was information to the
parents of the killed ( condoleance-letters) people got ashes of the dead
2 or 3 times.
In Auschwitz camp the Commissioner of the Reichsfuhrer had stolen
40 kgs. of tooth-gold, I do not remember the name of that nan, but I am sure
thatGLUCK must know him. In all camps the hair of men, women and children
have been Out and saved, the hair was used to make shoes for the winter-
equipmerit df the anr/y. lii-©jrtter taw present-easy'-IoSiS--hairy B2@rk Jiad	—
just a small cut in the hair as large as the hair cutting machine-itself.
The murdered HELDRICH gave orders that all faces of the prisoners
are to be marked with an invisialb ink first, from the top of the forehead
to the nose and across on the cheeks. This tatoo kept about three months
and had -to be renewed afterwards. GLtJCK and H0SCK ordered.•.. whilst commanders
of Aushwitz camp, the tatoo with number on the arms of tho prisoners. In
Mauthausen tatoos were scarce.
In Mauthausen there had been a gas room converted from a bath room,
or vice-versa, next door to the crematoria. Owing to the confession of
ZIEREIS, only executions have been persomed in this room. (That’s not true -
this is a notation of Dr. Toni ).
Z IE REIS denies that he gave order that prisoners in Gusen Camp
had to stay naked in cold winter before the wards until they fell dead on
the ground, mien he learnt such an order, he had forbidden it at once and
told about that to GLUCK, who treated his as SCHELSSKERL,
In the year 1942/43 1,000 Dutch Jews were brought to Mauthausen.
On 31.5.43 HIMMLER Was present and ordered that the Jews had to carry on
their shoulders heavy stones of granite,' more than 50 kgs. These stones
had to be brought up a high stair to build up the road near Wiener Graben.
They nearly all committed suicide by jumping down the high wall about 50
mtrs. in the deep. Shortly after HIMMLER's visit ZIEREIS gave knowledge
of that order to GLUCK and told to stop such action knowing all the civilians
could see it. The answer he got was that nobody has to get excited about
an order coming from the Reichsfuhrer himself. Three months later on about
1,000 Czechoslovakian Jews arrived. The mortality wafi at that time only 3%>
The heads in Berlin believed it not enough and Lippenhenschel rang up
ZIEREIS and asked him what was going on that he did not get numbers of killed.
ZIEEEIS says that he replied that he wants all the men for working pirposes.

- 8 -
From that time ZIEEEIS was treated as-unreliable, and.suspicious. He got
on reclamation after the other, as ho says ( but he advanced from Stum-
bannfuhrcr to Standartenfuhrer II).
Concerning the "Prominient" prisoners ZIEKEIS stated as follows;
The son of HOHTHY lived hero under the name "mouse", Badaglio
under the name BREUSEWETTER and CORTE under his real name. According to
the order of Gauleiter EIGR.UBER all had to be liquidated, but after an
interview with Col. HOPPER X refused to obey this order. He sent them to
Dachau, besides Corte, who has been put in the cell-ward. The doors of
the cell has nlways been unlocked, he. got S^-food,
ZIEREIS say, that as he means, in the section of Warszawa, Kowno,
Riga and Libau about 10 MILLION people have been murdered.
(ZIEREIS DIED on Thursday, 24th May 45, in the afternoon in
Guseri Camp Hosptial.)﻿V,

and say as follows:-
1. Further to my affidavit in the matter of Mauthausen concentration camp, of even
date0 While I was an inmate of Mauthausen, I was told by some other inmates that it
had been a practice at the camp to liquidate recaptured prisoners of war„ I was told that
American and British prisoners of war who had escaped, hp.d onbdag recaptured, been brought
to Mauthausen where they were killed,, A common method of killing these recaptured
prisoners of war was to make them run up some 80 steps from a quarry, carrying on ^ neii
shoulders a large and heavy piece of stone and when the prisoners fell exhausted, the
S.S. guards used sledge hammers to break the stones on the backs of the prisoners arid so
killed them. I was told that some 45 American and Britisfeprisonera of war were killed
by this means0
20 Other methods used to kill inmates were the infection of petrol into their veins,
and the use of a devioe resembling a height measuring stand which, when the top piece
was brought to the level of the head of the person being measured, a bullet was
automatically fired into the back of the neck»

of L;. Brian 3tonehouse and Lt.
Siiepherd, by -0.1.
MATOHAUSISK was the vjoi-st type of Ouncentraxion Gawp. It was
particularly used for the gradual exteriaination of the Jews that
were sent there. The pritoners hod all their clothes taken away
and were dressed in striped trousers and had a flannel shirty they
wore wooden soled clogs and the cobbled courtyard was so designed
as to make walking as difficult as possible.
The Jews, on entering the Ca:np were given a number and made to
ear the btar of Judah. There was a quarry in the side of the
hill on which the camp stood, which .i:.r reached by a staircase of
187 steps. '.very day parties of Jews were taken down to the
quarry an 1 were made to return up the staircase carrying a heavy
block of granite for the alleged purpose of building a wall. Every
day parties of Jews would be pushed over the top of the quarry and
if they wore lucky they fell to their dent!;, ir they survived they
were brought up and nished over n.y V. until they died. Their
bodies were dra ; ;ed to 'an incinerator nee:: the quarry and disposed
of in t'ni.. way. hand Jew:; hi, not survive longer :hvm a week or
three weeks as they were systematically enter innted.	One German
guard admitted to dtonohousc- that he .as responsible hi: self for
the death of over 1, b)G Jews*
There was a hospital but no-one was admitted unless he had
41 centigrade of fever. It was rare bv ■ utt'one ad: tit ted to the
hospital to cone out alive as the doctors gave then, an injection
which killed them.
The food was much the same as at NSIBRilk; -Iso the

Shepherd worked in the quarry at cuip in granite blocks, and
Stonehouse on or dinar;/ quarrying. Thelatter said he -vas
frequently struck by the guards with shovels. There was a
Prenchman at this camp ca lled R/diK LUGlSffiUHL, who hated the
Englishmen and was responsible for their having to work rn the
quarry.
There was an Englishman called Edward GALEEUDER, born 3rd iiarc

Dear Ledingham,
(1)	I am enclosing a cable 'A' which de Baer and I
drafted to meet a request by Colonel DENSON the Prosecutor in
this trial. The situation is that the (U, S.) Commander Taylor,
ex-inmate of Dachau who is a witness here said that the two
British officers named in the cable were in Mauthausen and could
make statements - indeed I gather that they have already done so,
but if so it never reached the U.N.W.C. C. It might be well to
supply the two officers with a list of the defendants and ask than
to say if they know anything against any of them. General de
Baer is taking the cable with him as you will get it sooner that
way.
(2)	I also enclose a list of defendants marked 'B* (see
covering note). de Baer asks to have 3 copies of it sent to his
office.
(3)	Colonel Hanson(?), the Prosecutor, says that he did
not get any Mauthausen material from our National Offices. That is
disappointing; I brought out some chairges etc. with me, v;hich I
have given him.
A Plossenburg trial is in preparation here now. I
hope our National Offices will contribute material.
(4)	I met here a group of British officers who have come
to interrogate Karl Brandt, former Health Minister on purely
technical matters ""(about chemical war). They said that Brandt
had been kept at "Dustbin" (Frankfort) and then at Nuremberg, and
was finally sent here as no one wanted him, and that as "There is
nothing against him in his file" he is likely to be released.’.*
I told them he was on our list as a bar Criminal (a very bad one
too), and they were astonished. They said no one had ever been
to interrogate him.
I suggest you look him up to see what Governments have
charged him, and let them know he is here. You might also ask
Mrs. Braid for the "Beelitz Mercy Killing report", and a Summary of
information entitled the "Instructional Staff of the Death Camps".
Brandt was, I understand, largely responsible for the "mercy-killing"
system, for which minor people (e.g. Hadamar defendants) have been
sentenced to hanging.
It is very baffling that nobody seems to know that
they should look at the U.N.W.C.C. lists, if indeed they get them.
I hope to fly back on Thursday 4th inst. It is an
interesting tidal, but Dachau is at the bottom of a well. I have
not seen a newspaper since Tuesday.

Dear Brigadier Shapcott,
I enclose an extract from my report on a visit to Dachau
relating to Karl Brandt.
In case any of your war crimes services wish to interrogate
him I enclose Summaries of Information Nos.24,39 and 41. He is
in P.W.E. (Prisoner of War Enclosure) No.29 at Dachau.

6 April 1946»
With further reference to our telephone conversation on 2
April 1%6 and to your letter of th t date about MAITfHADSEN
Concentration Cstmp, I am now in a position to send you further
infomation about tiie points raised.
1.	I enclose a copy of a minute together with copies of two
affidavits which 1 have sent to the War Crimes Office, 3*“d U.S.
Army, which sets out the position fully. You will see from the
affidavits of Captain John Starr that he can give good general
evidence about war crimes committed at MAXTiliABSEK Concentration
Camp during the three months that he was the its but that he cannot
identify any of the accused who are named in the United St- tea
charge sheet. He can, however, be sent to DACHAU as a witness if
the U.S. Authorities desire it. with regard to Flight-
Lieutenant Anthony Spears, Royal Fir force, you will see that the
Royal Air Force have been unable to trace anyone of that or a
similar name and that there is reason to believe that the person
in MAUTHAUSEN who passed under tli t name was a Gemaa ^stool-
pigeon* or a collaborator.
2. With regard to SS Qbergruppenfuhrer Dr. Karl BRAKDfE we
certainly have a considerable amount of information. I enclose a
copy of two interrogations of a German prisoner of war named
BLRICK who was Interrogated in London District Gage about BRANDT
some time ago. You will see that the documents contain a good
deal of information about BRANDT in his capacity as the
"HSICHSKGMMXSSAR PUSH DAS SANITABTS- IMD GiiSMDHSITSWESEN. The
D.J.A.G. at British Army of The Rhine is preparing a case against
BRANDT and is in possession of a great deal more evidence. H®
assures a© that B ANDT was sent to NUREMBERG on the understanding
that when his interrogation w s complete he should be returned to
/British Army of The Rhine.......﻿﻿V	u;S"- fe'■ e

I, No, 230430 Captain John Ashfe rd RonAhaw STARR, General List, with
permanent home address at 31» Eleanor t '©scant, Newcastle-under-Lyme,
Staffordshire, make oath and eay as follows t-
. mmq as’.? <peo slodir mi Jaiii noiacooo sno no IIsoot l
1,	I was taken prisoner at DIJON or 10 Jtily, 1943, dressed in civilian
clothes, I had been organising a Fror :ih Resietance Movement in the Jura
area of France, Between July 1943 ant January 1945 I passed through several
prisons and concentration camps and ulv mately in January 1945 1 found
myself at MAUTHAUSEN Concentration Camj I remained there until the end
of April	doua snl .Aitsob 0} ;™a 80	^
2,	MAUTHAUSEN was not so much a cor jentration camp as an extermination
camp. It was indeed called by the 'rci.ians themselves there *7ERNICHTNUNGS-
LAGER*, meaning 'EXTERMINATION CAMP'. The words 'DU KCMMST NIEMALS RAUS’,
meaning 'YOU WILL NEVER COME OUT', were engraved in atone above the prison
gate;- a* '®fl? 1,' ; ;	,8<^ rlrf5 ^ ».w r’ l© one rtl '
3,	During ny time there, there were perhaps ©cot® 45,000 inmates.
These consisted of ©Very conceivable a? jionality including German criminals.
These German crimimls were put in chai 5© of the 30 bleaks housing the
Inmates, These German criminal gu&rdf, had the right of life or death over
the inmates. The majority of th® peop le in MAUTHAUSEN had previously been
in other concentration camps and had bem taken to MAUTHAUSEN with the
object of working or starving them to caath. The death roll w&e roughly
500 a day. Of these seme 250 might have died from starvation, dysentery,
and other illnesses, and the balance net their death in a variety cf ways,
such as being gassed, beaten to death, thrown over a stone quarry, chewed
up by hungry doga, hanged, shot, and ao on. The dead bodies were then
consumed in an incinerator. During ray time there the inmates were forced
to build a second incinerator. Even these two incinerators ware insufficient
to consume the dead remains, although they were working night and day, and
accordingly a huge pit was dug by inmates into which dead bodies were thrown.
4. On a party arriving at MAUTHAUSEN Gamp those who were ill were lined
up separately and made to undress. At the time I arrived at the camp it
was vary ©old and the sick people were kept in a complete state of nudity
for the whole day,- Towards the evening these sick people were forced by
brutal beatings of truncheons into the shower baths'where they were made to
without any
of the
a
<r\
/be reasonably,.﻿- 2 ~
te reasonably fit were marked with a number on the cheat, and those who did
not, were marked with the letters 'EL' on the back. Those marked 'KL’ were
put through the hot and cold showers in the way I have described and beaten
tip all through the night and those who ware not dead by the morning were
frequently finished off with fire axes. I myself have seen these incidents
take place exactly as I have stated.	x
5.	There was at MAUTHAUSEN a gas cheaber. Every day a party of inmates
varying between 100 and 200 were marched into the gas chamber and exterminated.
6.	It is impossible to exaggerate thi sadistic brutalities of the S3 guards.
For no reason at all Inmates of the camj. already in a deplorable physical
condition would be picked upon and beat>, i or otherwise done to death.
7.	1 recall on one occasion that the whole camp was paraded and the
commandant passed through the lines feel, .ng the arms of the inmates. Those
who appeared to him to be sufficiently : rong were set aside for working
parties, but those whom he decided from he thinness of their arms to be of
insufficient strength, were set aside t< be liquidated.
8.	I have myself seen inmates beatei to death. One such incident
occurred in the hut in which I was lodge One of the Inmates, a Jew,
wan suspected to have spoken to other J< s against the harsh treatment.
This oame to the ears of the Block Chiei who in the presence of the other
inmates, beat this Jew to death.
9* The camp was divided into 3 sub-c sips, 1, 2 and J. I was in No. 3
Gamp and housed in one of 5 huts. Thei > were about 1,500 in Ho. 3 Ccnp in
all. Every night the German criminals ut over us thrashed us with thonga
to make us huddle together more closely o provide sufficient room for ua
all to lie down. About March 1946 No. Gamp was evacuated and some 1,000
other Inmates, all sick to the point of .oath, were moved in to the 5 huts.
Every conceivable article was moved out, suoh as blankets, palliasses and
feeding bowls, until absolutely nothing emained. Th® camp was then looked
up and the 1,000 rdok inmates abandoned o perish from hunger. The only
time that the gates were opened was to < lleci the dead. I myself have
seen iiimates -eko were no more than anicr ed skeletons fighting with each
other to obtain a blade of grass to eat.
10.	Every conceivable fora of brutal! y was practised by the guards and
incidents were eo numerous that it is di ficult for me to select ary one
worse than another. Cannibalism was ps ctised. On one occasion a horre
we.e killed and I myself saw inmates cons me the raw entrails.
11.	The camp was staffed by German S£ I do not know the names of any
of these; X never had an opportunity of learning such names. I believe,
however, that the name of the commandant was Hauptstursafuhrer BA.CHt7.YEH*
Although I do not know any names, it is not unlikely that I night be able
to recognise some of then if X were to see them.
12.	X remember in April 1945 there was a raid by American Fortresses on the
town of LINZ, near MABTHABSBf. X saw 3 of the Fortresses brought down by
anti-aircraft fire sad. X saw sene of the crews coining gown by parachute.
Shortly afterwards on the sans day X saw 2 American airmen brought into the
other American airmen. X Byself saw in all half a dossn of the *»»«•**»»»>«
lined up facing the prison well and X sar the 88 beat then m. the last X
saw of the Amerloan airmen was when they were la a party of inmates Shout to
enter the gas chsmber.
/«﻿5
t
13* la April 1945 a umber of Frenoh, Belgian and Dutch inmates of the
camp were evacuated, I was able to aee me Trench nationality and make my
way out with the French contingent* I cade my way to Switsorland and
thence to PARIS.

1. .Further to my affidavit in the matter of Mauthausen concentration camp, of even
date. While 1 was an inmate of Mauthausen, I was told by some other inmates that it
had been a practice at the camp to liquidate recaptured prisoners of war. 1 was told that
American and British prisoners of war who had escaped, had onfaeLig recaptured, been brought
to Mauthausen where they were killedo A common method of killing these recaptured
prisoners of war was to make them run up some 80 steps from a quarry, carrying on their
shoulders a large and heavy piece of stone and when the prisoners fell exhausted, the
S„S» guards used sledge hammers to break the stones on the backs of the prisoners and bo
killed theme I was told that some 45 American and Briticir prisoners of war were killed
by this means0
20 Other methods used to kill inmates were the injection of petrol into their veins,
and the use of a device resembling a height measuring stand which, when the top piece
was brought to the level of the head of the person being measured, a bullet was
automatically fired into the back of the neck,.

Reference telephone conversation 5 April 1946,
Lieutenant-colonel Barratt - Captain Vollaar.
1.	I understand that you have a good deal of evidence
against Dr. Karl BRANDT whose case is being investigated.
The object of ngr telephone call was to enable ae to answer
some questions by Lieutenant-colonel H.H. Wade of the United
Nations War Crimes Commission who has recently been visiting
DACHAU. Vollmar gave me all the necessary information.
2.	I understand that a conference Is to be held in about
fourteen days time in order to decide ahat action is to be
taken in relation to BRANDT and that arrangements have been
made for his return to you after interrogation. Lieutenant-
colonel Wade stated that BRANDT was at present he-ld in P.W.S.
(a prisoner of war enclosure) Ko. 29 A.P.O. 205 U.S. Army and
I assume that this is in accordance with the arrangements.
If not you will doubtless get into touch with the United
States Authorities.
3.	I enclose herewith the information about BRANDT which
Lieutenant-colonel Wade has forwarded including a short report
and also copies of two interrogations of San Soldat Fritz
BLEIGH. BLSICH was interrogated at London District Cage in
April 1945 and I understand he is now held by the Anericans.
His interrogator tells me that he was very anxious to tell all

QUESTIONS BY PROSECUTION (Continued)
Q I hand you a photograph marked Prosecution's Exhibit
No. 62 for identification, and ask you to e xamine that and
state w hat it is.
A That is the corner in which the neck shots were performed.
Q Is that a true and correct representation of that portion
of the room in which neck shots were performed, that was used

A That is the same corner, only after the Americans arrived,
because the S3 - before they left - had torn off the black
wall, which was a wooden wall.
Q And other than the alteration that you have just mentioned
to the court, is that a true and correct representation of
that room?
A Yes.
PROSECUTION:	We offer at this time, may it please the Court,
photograph marked Prosecution's Exhibit No. 62, in evidence.
MAJOR CEDING: May we see that, sir? I have no objection

QUESTIONS BY PROSECUTION (Continued):
Q fill you describe to the Court, please, the method whereby
these neck shots were carried out, Mr. Ornstein?
PROSECUTION:	Excuse me, may he sit down?
PRESIDENT:	Yes.
(Whereupon the witness resumed the stand.)
QUESTIONS BY PROSECUTION (Continued):
Q All right, sir, will you describe that procedure to the
Court, Mr. Ornstein?
A The neck shots were carried out in different ways. They
were performed differently against Americans in high offices and
women, audit was performed differently towards prisoners. In
the case of American officers and women there was always a screen
which was put up there and was supposed to show a camera. Fur-
thermore, after every neck shot the 00 men would get rid of the
blood so that the next one coming in there would not see the
blood. That is in comparison with the execution of prisoners, where
from eight to ten (8 to 10) prisoners were executed in succession
and only after that all the blood was removed. Those 63 people
who took part in the executionsh ad their various functions.
One was in the clothing room and sent the people, the others
were in the hallways from the clothing room to the execution
room; one was at the door and always called out "next one"?
one was at the camera and called out "photograph"; one of them
always prepared the ammunition and loaded the weapon^ the others
held the innocent victims by the hand if they struggled and didn't
want to turn around. The hangings were done differently.
1176﻿4

No. 63 for identification, and ask you to examine that and
state what it is.

hanged.
Q That is a true and correct representation of the spot
where the people were hanged in Mauthausen while you were
there?
A Yes.
PROSECUTION:	We offer at this time, may it please the
Court, photograph marked Prosecution's Exhibit No. 63 in
evidence.
MAJOR CEDING: No objection.
PRESIDENT:	There beigg no objection, the exhibit offered
by the Prosecution is admitted in evidence and marked "Prosecution^

(Whereupon the photograph was received in evidence and
marked "Prosecution's Exhibit No. 63.")
QUESTIONS BY PROSECUTION (Continued)
Q fill you describe, please, the method andprocedure that
was followed in the hanging of prisoners while you were there
in Mauthausen, in that room?
A Yes. That was in an iron traverse, on an iron rod.
There was a rope wrapped around, and three people at a time were
hanged. Under the rod there was a chair set up with springs in
it. Those that were sentenced had to stand up on the chair, had
to put the rope around their own necks, one 33 man secured the
rope on one side, pressed the spring, the chair fell down and
those sentenced remained hanging in the air. They hanged about
ten minutes on the rope, and afterwards they had to be taken into
the cooling room.
1177﻿4

to the shooting and hanging room?
A Yes, that was the adjoining room where the hanging and
shooting took place.

oil furnace. On the 12th April a double furnace was finished,
so altogether there were four furnaces.

WITNESS TH03T; Yes.
PRESIDENT:	Continue with the questioning.
QUESTIONS BY PROSECUTION (Continued):
Q Who was .present, Doctor, at the interrogation of Major
Sehmer?
A The Camp Commandant Ziereis was present, Habeckar as
interrogating officer, partly myself as .interpreter, and as far
as I know the chief of the barracks by the name of iltfuldisch.
He kept going in andout, he had something to do there and kept
going in and out.
Q Describe the treatment that Major Sehmer received during
that interrogation.﻿t

.4 Tiie room in which, the interrogation took place was
very small. Just at the entrance Ziereiss was sitting opposite
him, the prisoner, Major Sehmer, and left of that - more in
the room (indicating) - I was.sitting, and opposite the
interrogating officer Habeker. In the moment the first or
second question had hardly been asked, Ziereis took the glasses
away from the prisoner and hit him in the face with the palm of
his hand, and Ziereis continuously demanded that Habecker hang
up the prisoner by his wrists, without the slightest cause being
given for that. Just the opposite, the constant disturbances
and interruptions by Siereis hindered the course of the•interro
gatioa considerably. ./hen a question was asked which Major
Sehmer couldn't answer correctly, Habecker took his chair and
sat down behind the prisoner, took his hands and put them on
his back (indicating), took a snort stick anu put them between
the fingers of both hands of the prisoner (indicating), and
pressed the hands together in such a manner that strong pains
were definitely caused.
In the later course of the interrogation, upon request
of Ziereis, the prisoner was taken into a room opposite and was
hanged up by his wrists. I must say that 1 did not .see tnis,
however, I heard the screams and I knew why the prisoners were
being taken into that room.
j /hat was the condition of the Major's nands after ne wqs
brought back into the room?
A The prisoners had to sign a statement, and Major oeamer
could hardly write because all the blood Was drawn from his
hands.
Q Now, when you stated'a moment ago, Doctor, that tney
inserted wooden sticks between the fingers, will you please be
1188
)﻿• • •
•
more explicit and describe to the Court, as best .you can, the
position of that stick with respect to each finder?
4 That was a stick, the length of a pencil...
Q And. when you say, "the len&th of a pencil,'1 approximately-
how many centimeters is that?
4 Maybe twenty-five (25) centiments, and slightly thicker
than a pencil. The fingers of tne hand were partly over and
partly under the stick, and then if you pressed the fingers to-
gether they to ohed the pencil, which causes great pain.
Q v/hat other mistreatment did you ascertain that these
prisoners received-at this interrogation?
4 The first prisoner was a man who in reality did not
belong to this delegation, but had bee.n put together with tnis
delegation in Czechoslovakia because he was an agent wno had
parac iuted into the vicinity of Vienna and was supposed /to spy
there. This agent, when he was interrogated, called himself a
Scottish or Scotch sergeant by the name of rfilson. However,
the interrogating Criminal Secretary Habecker doubted nis
identity, especially the fact that he was supposed to be Scottish,
and took him over into the torture chamber. I said upon that,
that under those conditions, I could not interpret, and told
them that I would immediately put in a telephone call to Berlin
in order to get an expert there who is Scottish, and who could
tell immediately whether he was a Scotsman or not. In the mean-
time the prisoner suddenly started talking Berman, and Habeker
sent me out, back to my quarters. And when I came back in the
afternoon, Habpkcer told me, in a few minutes, by his metnods,
who the prisoner had been, that he had been a Jew from Vienna.
During this interrogation of .‘/arneoerf er, which is his right
name, I wasn't necessary ince the prisoner could speak Berman.
Q Doctor my question is, what other inis treatment did you
see or ascertain that these prisoners received there during
1189﻿
w
the interrogation?
A The second mistreatment I noted in connection with a
Sergeant lillis, from the British delegation, when I came in.
However, Habeaker did not continue the mistreatment- however,
I saw that Habecker had a whiji in his hand and that tne
prisoner was bound like this (indicating).
Q And when you say "like this," what do you mean? Describe
it in words, i-5!0386?
A The prisoner was kneeling, his hands were bound underneath
, the shin, somewhere there (indicating), and Habecker had a
whip in his hand.
Q fhat kind of a whip was it, Doctor?
A It was a so-called "ox-tail."
Q Continue.
A Hien I was in there, Habecker untied the prisoner and the
interrogation continued in a normal manner.
PROo'SCOTIO 1; No further questions,'sir.

stopped an execution by Ziereis?
A Yes, that was a case with me.
Q Did you volunteer for your job in the crematorium?
A No.
C Were you ever ordered to participate in an

PROSECUTION:	v.e object to that, may it please the

of his rights against self incrimination before he is
r
required to make an answer to that question,and on the further
ground that this ma r; is not on trial before this Court and
is not material or relevant to the issues of this case.
MAJOR, OERDING:	If it please the Court, I asked the
witness if he was ever ordered- to participate in an exe-
I
cution. All I am trying to bring out is that they received
orders in Mauthausen and when they received orders they had to
be obeyed. If the Court deems it advisable, I have no objection
to this witness being advised of his rights.

A Our work shifts were distributed in three hours, four
men on every shift. That is talcing care of the furnaces and to
bring the bodies into the furnaces. The whole crew was used for
that.
Q Were you ever a capo?
A No.
Q Block eldest?
A Not that either.
Q At the execution of the two Americans and other people
that you mentioned, were you in the room when they were executed?
A Yes.
Q When the one prisoner from the bunker was executed were
you also in the room?
A Of course.
Q Did you state on direct examination that after this prisoner
was executed, you came into the room and carried him ou't?
A I will have to explain that. Three men were always used
at an execution. One of them took care of the furnaces and when
the body fell down, one man would take him by his left arm, the
other one by his right arm and the strongest ones by the legs.
1218﻿That is the way he was carried away.
Q Were official orders of execution signed by Himmler
in your knowledge?
A I don't know. I couldn't give you any information about
that.
Q Do you know whether or not these people that you saw
executed were ordered executed after trial by court martial?
A No, I don't know that.
MAJOR CEDING: No further cross examination.
