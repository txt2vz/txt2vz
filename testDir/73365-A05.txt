NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—166 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as
(a)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earhest possible moment in one of the following ways
(а)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(б)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

Under reference G]/Br/l5l66/A-3	10 Jun 45 we
have received from Allied Force Headquarters copies of
statements from 19 ex-internees who were evacuated to
Capri. We are informed that you and the J.A.G.’s Dept,
also"received copies of these statements. Many of these
internees had come from Flossenburg.
Capt. Buckley recently, asked me if this Department
had any Officers who had been in Flossenburg at the same

P.rp.﻿It is considered that the statement by J.L.E.
MOGENSEN describes fully the events of 29 March 45, when
our Officers are known to have been killed and, therefore,
, that this statement may for the moment serve the purpose
required by Capt, Buckley. The first paragraph of page
3 of Capt. H. LUNDIMl deals with the same iriotant♦

There are two other Officer of whose identity we
are not absolutely certain, but we believe that the informa-

We are not able to identify two "other British
Officers mentioned, viz. HENET, cell No. 15 and MICHEL in
cell No. 17.
The majority of these Officers were commissioned
in the Secret List and their names, therefore, do not
necessarily appear in the Army List.

respect of this camp, nor in fact aij I aware of any of the names, for
this camp is in the Russian zone and I understand that the Russians are
anxious to try the camp staff of concentration camps in their zone.

23 Oct l£, it is considered that Mile. Geneviere DSVIE’s
letter probably refers to V/21Q313 Lt. P.J. AMRiLETT,
General List. We would also point out that other informa-
tion in Mile. Devie's letter is incorrect. We know from
other sources that all the British Officers were execueted
between 7 and 10.05 a.m. on the morning of 29 Mar 45 and
not killed off gradually as is suggested.
The remarks as to their exemplary courage
in spite of their severe sufferings, and their uncompromising
attitude towards their jailors, bears out what we have already
heard from other sources.
We are passing on to Lieut. Ainphlett's father

OP:-
Gaptain LUNDING Hans,
Danish General Staff.
12th my 1945.
I was arrested in Copenhagen on 29th August 1943. I was detained from
this date until 1st September 1943 “by Wehrmacht in Copenhagen when I was handed
over to the Gestapo by whom I was detained at their prison in Copenhagen. On the
15th September, 1943 I vra.s transferred to the Gestapo Headquarters at
ERIMYALBSRCIED STRASS3 No. 8, BERLIN.
I was given no reason for my arrest but on 17/l8th September I was
interrogated by Gestapo Officers including Kriminalrat EEMER and Kriminalsecretariat
SCHULTZ. These Police Officers were members of the SS SD. The interrogation took
place under strong electric lights, during which time I was threatened and intimi-
dated. These interrogations took place two or three times a week until about 15th
J anuary, 1944.
On or about this date the building in which I was kept was severely
damaged during an Allied Air Raid and then the interrogations ceased.
I was interrogated because the Gestapo believed that I was connected
with a Taste Underground Movement in Denmark. In fact I was connected with the
Danish Secret Service and from 1937 had contacted the British Secret Service. The
information passed by me and my Section after the Germans occupied Denmark,
included dispositions of German troops, Garrisons, guns, etc., in Denmark.
Also information was collected and passed about AA guns in Hamburg and VI sites
on the coast. Photographs and details of a VI experimental bomb were obtained
and forwarded via Sweden but the information was intercepted by the Germans at the
frontier. I visited Sweden in 1942 and at Stocldiolm contacted the British and
Polish Legations and was recognised by a German Agent who no doubt reported the
fact to their Gestapo authorities and this is more than likely the reason for my
arrest.
I was detained in Berlin until July 1944, when I was moved to a
Concentration Camp.
At Flossenburg in Bavaria in cell 21 where I ms detained until April
1945> I was quite well treated and had the same food as the SS troops. There
were between 10 and 15 British and Canadian Officers detained in the prison of
the Camp whilst I vra.s there. At first each roan had a separate cell but later
due to overcrowding two or more were put in a cell. The cells were arms breadth
wide and 5-g- paces long with a small boarded up window which allowed very little
light. During the time I was there I never saw the British or Canadian prisoners
out of the cells. The only furniture was a wooden bed and palaise of wood
shavings. In each cell there was a lavatory and a bowl to wash in. The
prisoners were allowed a bath a fortnight. The only clothes were the prison
uniform without underclothing. Three blankets were at first allowed but these
were reduced to two. These blankets were very worn and in filthy condition.,
I was allowed out for exercise for an hour each day. About the middle
of August the Kalfaktor (jailer) allowed me out when the SS guards were absent
and let me look into a cell No. 23 which was occupied by a Canadian Officer - I
believe a Captain. He was lying on his bed reading. He was about 27 to 35
years old, 5' 10", dark hair, lined face, haggard and starved. I do not know
his name.
Between the 1st and 15th September, 1944, about 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, I heard firing from what I took to be a firing squad about 250 yards
away. As this happened I heard a loud cry and everything ms quiet. The next
morning the Kalfaktor told me in the exercise yard that the Canadian Officer from
cell 23 had been shot. I did not see the officer after he was shot. The
Canadian Officer I believe was the Camp Leader of the British and Canadian
prisoners. I know that 2 or 3 days after the shooting that cell 23 ms occupied
by another prisoner who was allowed out for an hour each day.	The Kalfaktor told
me that the officer had been shot with full military honours by a firing squad which
was the only occasion that I know this took place.
The prison side of the Camp was divided into two wings - East and ’Test,﻿, - 2 -
and I -was in the latter. At the extreme end of the West wing was the site where
.executions took place and ray cell was about 40 yards - probably less - from this
spot.	From	a crevice in the wooden door of my cell I was able to see into the
yard and see prisoners being taken to execution. There were several reasons why
I knew they were going to execution^ firstly - the prisoners were always naked;
secondly - their hands were always bound either in front or behind them; thirdly -
there were always certain sounds which by i-eason of my long incarceration I was
able to understand exactly what they meant. There were two forms of execution -
one by hanging and the other by shooting. The shooting was carried out by a
revolver with a silencer attached, but in spite of the silencer there was always a
noise caused by the revolver which having heard on so many occasions I knew so well.
For hangings there were the necessary apparatus for six hangings to take place at the
same time and the apparatus consisted of six sets of iron rings fastened into the
wall each two rings being one above the other. Through each pair of rigs ms
placed an iron bar in the form of a right angle. By the lovrer ring there was
fastened a piece of rope at the end of which was a noose and the end of the rope
was hung over the iron bar. The prisoner ms made to mount a ladder, the noose
ms put over his head and the ladder then pulled away.
After shootings there was sometimes fresh blood to be seen on the ground
and sawdust - after hangings there was nothing to be seen.
Before executions the prisoners were put into the bathroom near the site.
In this room they were made to undress. The bathroom was about 15 yards from my
cell, and I could hear the patter of naked feet, as they walked from the bathroom
to execution. By the bathroom was a guard and just outside in the yard ms another
who was able to witness the executions. I could hear this guard call to the other
.guard on the bathroom "next11 or words to that effect, and following this order it
ms then I could hear the patter of naked feet. The guard in the yard outside made
sure that the prisoner went to the execution site; sometimes a prisoner would make
a dash in the opposite direction and would be shot. The prisoners, when they went
to the bathroom, did not know they were going to be executed - so far as they were
aware they were going for their occasional bath.
On 29th March 1945 I was not allowed to take my morning exercise which
consisted of a walk in the prison yard. Between 9 suvi 10 a.m. I heard certain
sounds and I got on to my knees and peeped through the crevice in my door. In the
yard I saw going towards the execution site naked prisoners.	They went by one at
a time with intervals of between 3 and 5 minutes.	Their hands were bound in front
of them, and each one was escorted by two guards.	I saw in all 8 or 9 prisoners
go by - then because of my cramped position I stood up, and although I did not see
anything further I heard several more pass by. I had never before seen prisoners
escorted to execution. I did not see anything more of these prisoners. When I
went for my exercise later that morning I ms not allowed to mill in that end of the
prison yard and was allowed only in the Bast Wing. My impression ms that every
precaution was taken to keep these particular executions secret. Later the same
day I ms talking to Rottenfuehrer WEISSENBOM (over whom I had some hold) and I
asked him who were executed that morning. At first he shrugged his shoulders and
said nothing. I then asked him if thejr were Germans and he said "No". I then
asked if it was my Danish comrades and he said "They are alright." I then said
"Was it the English" and he said "Yes - there are no more English and it is good so."
During my ten months detention in the prison at FLOSSEMBURG I iggself
witnessed about 400 people POLES, CZECHS, and RUSSIANS and a few Germans going to
their execution. The executions usually took place once or twice a week, there were
however, occasions when the interval was of a longer period. I saw from my cell
them going towards the execution site, naked, and at first T also saw bodies
being carried away on stretchers. After a time however I became so disgusted that
on seeing people walking to their execution I retired in my cell and did not look
to see the bodies carried away. At the execution there was always present a Doctor,
whom I saw on several occasions and I ms told by the KAIFAKTOR a dentist for the
purpose of removing metal fillings from teeth.
One day vrhilst taking exercise in the yard I saw a man who had just been
interrogated. He had been beaten about the face and he ms bleeding about the eyes,
nose and lips and was limping. He had obviously been severely beaten.
1 asked the KALFAKTOR the identity of this man and he told me he was a
Russian Colonel-General. Later the KALFiKTOR told me he had been executed.
From the window in my cell I was also able to see into the Camp Area and
during this time I saw many bodies being carried past the window. During the four
months from November 1944 and February 1945 I counted approximately 5*000 (five﻿- 3 -
thousand) bodies. The bodies were carried past my window on stretchers. At
first there were only 4 or 5 stretchers being used, but this was later increased
f to 7. On each stretcher two bodies were carried at the time. The people had
died from starvation or disease and sometimes the bodies were so emaciated as to be
almost shapeless and one could see just a bulge of their head and feet. The bodies
were usually covered by a blanket but it was always possible to see the head and
feet. Occasionally during the winter when the ground was covered with ice the
stretcher bearers would slip down and the bodies would fall onto the ground. The
bodies that I then saw appeared to be those of people who had died from starvation.
These are the personalities concerned in the camp and its general
administration about whom I can give information.

MOGENBEN Jorgen Lariborg Pras,
Vice Consul,
Royal Danish Consulate,
DANZIG.

13 May 45.
In 1941 iifeilst I was Vice Consul in DANZIG, I contacted a Polish underground
movement whom I helped to organise. In 1942 I went to COFSdiAGM and there
contacted the DANISH organisation 'Postbox1, from whom I received certain instructions|
concerning the linking up of the DANISH and GDYNIA movements. This was in August
1942. In October of that year the GDYNIA movement which included the Pomeranian
area was rounded up by the Gestapo - I was not arrested. In April, 19435 one of the
Polish agents - Lucian CYLKOISKI - who had been arrested in October 1942, but later
escaped, again contacted me. He told me he was in contact with another Polish
movement controlled from WARSAW and that they had a wireless transmitter previously
dropped by the British for the Pomeranian movement, but they were unable to operate
it owing to lack of codes and necessary instructions and operators. False documents
and stamps were also necessary to assist the members in moving from one place to
another.
On 14th July, 1943, I went to COPENHAGEN, and made known to the Danish
'Postbox' 1:11636 requests. The 'Postbox' was controlled by the Polish Legation in
STOCKHOLM.
The 'Postbox' forwarded a letter to STOCKHOLM containing the requests
of the WARSAW controlled movement - GRYP POMORSKI - but it is believed that this
letter was intercepted at the frontier by the Germans. The reason why it was
thought that the letter had been intercepted was that the acknowledgement in code
over the BBC, was not received by the - GRYP PQMQRSKI - as expected.
Prom October 1943 to January 1944, I had no contact with either movements
owing to illness. In January 1944, however, a member of the 'POMORSKI' movement
visited me in DANZIG to collect documents and instructions for the movement. Prom
then onwards the visits were periodical.
On 19th March 44, I was requested by the Gestapo to visit their HQ in
DANZIG for the purpose of making arrangements concerning a DANISH prisoner.	On
arrival at the HQ I was accused by the Gestapo of having taken codes, stamps and
documents from the GRYP POMORSKI to the 'Postbox' in DENMARK. I ms also accused
of having given to 'GRIP POMORSKI'. information about German Communists in DANZIG -
further I was accused of giving 'GRYF POMORSKI' information of the DANISH movement
in general, and also sabotage carried out by British parachutists in DENMARK.
Whilst at the Gestapo HQ I saw the Polish Agent - LITCIM GYUvOWSKI - in a
corridor. As soon as I saw him his appearance convinced me he had been interrogated
and had had many hardships. He was very haggard and frightened, and although he had
no signs of -physical violence there was no doubt in my mind he had been detained for
some time. I was confronted by a statement made by him and dated 14th March
admitting I had assisted the underground movement. Being confronted with this
evidence and knowing if I denied it the Polish agent would be further tortured, I
admitted and signed a statement concerning ny previous activities with certain
limitations.
I was detained at the Gestapo HQ in DANZIG until 26th July 44, during which
time I was interrogated on many occasions but at no time was personal violence used.
On or about this date I was transferred to PLOSSENBURG, arriving two days
later. I was put into cell No. 24, and on one side - No. 23 - was a Canadian
Officer - a Major, and on the other side a British Lieutenant born in BELGIUM. The
Canadian Major told me his name was 'GUY'. He was very taciturn, but I learnt
from the Lieutenant in cell No. 25 and from an American Lieutenant in cell No. 27,
that he was chief of S.T.S. in PRANCE and was also their chief. I was told that
he had an injdry to his back and a broken knee - the latter having been received
during a German interrogation at MQuNNES, a suburb of PARIS. The British
Lieutenant informed me that the Major had complained to the Camp Commandant about
the lack of food and exercise for the British prisoners. The Commandant said he
would forward the complaint to BERLIN. The Lieutenant told me he had the greatest
admiration for the Major, who at PRERNES had undergone the severest form of interro-
gation and torture which included six instances when he was almost drowned and then
revived. The Lieutenant himself said that he had been beaten on several occasions
with truncheons.﻿_ 2 -
^	The name of the British Lieutenant was G-eorgeJ^^Jg^hut had adopted the
name of DEAhTS when he joined the British Forces in England, in order that his family,
still in BELGIUM, would not suffer. His address in England was 'Aspatria', 15 or 30
Outgang Road, CARLISLE. His family in BELGIUM lived at 15 or 30 Avenue de
WEESENBEGK, BRUSSELS. He was aged 24 years and married in England two months before
coming to France.
The American Lieutenant's name was John SULLIVAN. He had his 20th birthday
whilst in prison.	He was always ill - no doubt due to lack of food.
I stayed in cell Ho. 24 for about 2-g- months, - until Oct. 44 - when I was
moved to cell No. 2 in the East Wing. This was because I was making contact with
the British officers.
In September 1944, about a month previous to iqy move I heard the cell door
of Ho. 23 opened and I had the impression that two guards instead of the usual one,
called there and took away the Canadian major. There was some conversation hut I
could not distinguish it. I did not see the Major return and in fact did not see
or hear from him again. Some days after the cell ms occupied by an S.S. prisoner
I believe a Ukrainian.
Otto WIEDEN the Kalfaktor told me that the Canadian Major had been sent to
BERLIN for exchange. Everyone was pleased he was out of it, and the other English
prisoners thought that that might he their fate. Much later I was told by another
Kalfaktor, whose name I cannot remember, that he had Steen the body of the Major being
taken to the crematorium.
After ny move I found the following British prisoners in adjoining cells, all
in odd numbers.
Cell No. 1 A Frenchman then a Captain in the British Army. His code name was 'ROBIN',
His real name Jean WORMS. Born 1909, 22 Feb or 22 Mar. He ms chief assistant to
the Canadian Major. He and the British Officer in cell No. 7 were the leaders of the
other officers. His home was in PARIS, where he worked in peace time as chief agent
for the life assurance section of LLOYDS. His father owned the Maison Blanche, a
departmental store in PARIS. WORMS told me that whilst he was in FRENNES, Paris,
he was brutally tortured during interrogation by the Gestapo. The tortures included
the placing of two legs of a chair on his large toes and a Gestapo man jumping on the
chair until the toes split. An alternative method ms for the cioair to be placed on
the toes during interrogation and the Gestapo man sitting on the seat. If questions
were not answered, the interrogator jumped up and down on the chair. Another torture
was when he was seated on a chair and kept there for more than 72 hours, without food,
rest or sleep, during continual interrogation. When he fainted he was revived
without being released. I was able to talk much easier and for longer periods with
YfORMS than any of the others, as we made a small hole through the dividing wall of our
cells, throu^i which we were able to converse in low tones. WORMS had the greatest
and deepest admiration for the Canadian Major whom he stated had received the worst and
most brutal treatment from the Gestapo. .Even the Gestapo according to WORMS, had
admired the Major's fortitude and had rewarded his courage with a glass of champagne.
Cell No. 3 This was occupied by a Lieutenant of the British Army. His code name was
'ACHILLES'. I do not know his real name or his home address. He was about 35 years
of age, average height, dark hair, brushed hack, dark eyes, sallow complexion, caused
by starvation and hardship. ?/ore horn rimmed spectacles, fairly well built but thin.
In very bad health and his body ms covered with abscesses and boils. These never
received medical attention. The Lieutenant spent most of Ms time lying on his bed
because of extreme weakness. Believed that the Lieutenant was not tortured by the
Gestapo as he had been captured whilst landing by parachute. Apparently he did not
go to FRENNES.
Cell No. 5 A British Officer - either a Lieutenant or a Captain. His code name was
'EUGENE*. I do not know his real name. I saw Mm only once, from behind, and he was
of very short and small stature. High pitched voice. He occupied the cell with
another prisoner, a Yugoslav, BUDEN, and for security did not carry out much
conversation, as BUDEN ms not trusted.
Cell No. 7 A British Captain whose code name was 'JULES’. I have never seen him,
hut from general conversation, I believe he was connected with Barclays Bank. I
cannot supply any useful information concerning him. Joint leader with WORMS of the
other officers. Believed to have been badly tortured.﻿- 3 -
Cell Mo. 9. A Scotsman believed a Lieutenant. Code or real name not known. At
the end of Jan. or beginning of Feb. another British Captain or Lieutenant occupied
the cell with the Scotsman. His code name was 'ARISTIDE' and his Christian name
v/as 'BRIM*. I do not know his surname. Spoke English and French with a very-
educated voice. I never saw either of these Officers. 'ARISTIDE' had very-
severe stomach trouble which necessitated a special diet which was most unusual.
This fact makes me believe he was extremely ill.
Cell Ho, 11. One or two British Officers. I can give no information concerning
them.
Cell Ho. 13. One or probably two British officers. Again I can give no
information concerning them.
Cell Ho. 13. Occupied by Lieut. George DEMAND or DEANE, of whom I have previously
given information. There was also a German Communist in the same cell.
Cell No. 17. Occupied by a British Officer whose code name was 'MARCEL'. His real
name was Jack GRAHAM. Believed of Armenian extraction. I never saw or spoke with
him but heard has~v6ice over our communication system. He had a watch and each day
at every hour he would transmit the time by taps on the radiator.
For explanation the 'communication system' devised was as follows:- At
first, particularly on Sunday when one of the two guards was off duty, and the other
often went to bed, we used to shout to each other through a small wicker opening in
the door, used to pass food into the cells. One day 'Jules' told us to listen at
the lavatory pipe in the cell. It was then found that by removing the plug at the
bend in the pipe from the bowle to the mains sewer it was possible to converse with
ease in low tones with cells on either side from No. 1 to No. 17, a distance of 40
yards. Unless'the person in a cell removed the plug he was unable to hear or
converse with other cells. Apparently the other prisoners in even numbered cells
did not know of this system or speaking other languages did not use it as on only
one occasion have I heard a German voice over the 'intercom'. We also used morse
taps, but this v/as not very satisfactory as others could hear and it v/as only
possible to 'speak' to the nearest cells.
On 29th Mar. 45, about 5 a.m. to 5.30 a.m. our coffee, which was the only
thing we were given, was brought to the cells. At onoe I felt that something was
going to happen as this was an early hour for our food. My fears were Increased when
I was not allowed to go for ny usual morning exercise in the yard. About 0830
hours, I heard the doors of cells in the centre of the corridor opened - later these
turned out to be Nos. 9-11-1 then felt that Russian and Polish prisoners were
going for execution, but a moment or so later I heard WIESSENBORN'S footsteps pass
my door and go to cell No. 1 (WORMS) in which was also a Czech NOYAK. I heard
lEISSENBORN'S voice but v/as unable to distinguish it, it was quieter than usual,
a usual sign when executions were to take place. After he left the cell I got on
my knees and spoke to cell No, 1. The Czech was there alone and I felt WORMS had
gone for execution. I told the Czech to destroy any evidence WORMS may have left.
By this time I thought that I would be the next for execution, but then the guards
went to Cell No. 3 and 'Achilles' v/as taken away. Shortly after they went to Nos.
5 and 7 and took the prisoners away. I was sure then that all the British Officers
were being taken away for execution. Having been a prisoner for so long one's ears
become as reliable as one's eyes and one could 'see' events through sound. I have
grown to know every movement and sound. There was a lapse of time between the
prisoners from cells Nos. 5 and 7 going and those of Nos. 13, 15, and 17. At the
time I was under the impression that they were being shot, because of the short
lapse of time between each execution, and it is only later that statements made by
other prisoners have convinced me that they were hanged. In all six or possibly
seven British Officers had been taken away. After the lapse of time those from the
cells No. 13, 15 and 17 were taken.
I did not hear it myself but another DANISH prisoner LARSEN in cell No. 18,
told me that just before 'Marcel' in No. 17 -was taken in tapped in morse on the
dividing wall, "I hope they will end with me and you will not follow", then as
the guards opened his cell door he tapped "Goodbye - its 1005 hours".
About 7 April certain alterations were made at the execution site. This
site which v/as against the West wall of the prison had a lean to roof about 5 yards
wide supported by posts in the front. At the right side of this lean to shed was
a walled off portion about a third of the front making a three sided hut with roof.﻿- 4 -
This portion was used to store bodies after execution and before removal from
# the prison. On the above date the whole of the front ms walled in with rough
wood and a small white door fitted in the centre. The hanging apparatus was
removed and the blood soaked sawdust on the floor, swept up and burned. There
was a general tidying up of the area, no doubt because of fear of what the
approaching American Armies would find on arrival.
During the nine months or so I was at PLOSSEtiBIIRG- I saw through the door
of my cell in the West wing several hundreds of prisoners going to the execution
site. Also from the window I saw several thousands of bodies being carried up
the hill at.the side of the camp going towards the crematorium. From ray cell in
the East wing I also saw a number being taken to the crematorium from the opposite
side of the prison.
I have been told of various punishments which took place in the prison.
One Polish girl aged about 24 years was sentenced to either 25 or 50 lashes of the
whip, for attempting to escape. This punishment was believed carried out by the
prostitutes from the brothel. Another punishment was placing prisoners on
starvation diet and giving no food for various periods, and also removing the
mattresses and blankets.
The brothel was set up with female prisoners from the camps who were given
the option of becoming prostitutes or execution or other horrors. The brothel was
close to ny cell in the East wing and from talking overheard I do not think there
were more than 15 girls there at a time and it was run by WEIHE a Scharfuhrer, who
took bribes of cigarettes etc. for allotting various girls to the customers.
WIBSSEKBORN told me on one occasion that the ashes of bodies from the
crematorium were being used as fertilisers by the Germans.
I have seen Captain HINDING-'s statement giving the names and descriptions
of personalities of the camp and agree and corroborate them in all detail.
The personalities of the Gestapo at DANZIG are as follows

Prance.
I ms sentenced to death by the War Council of LILLE in January 1944 for
espionage and membership of the GAULLISTE RESISTANCE GROUP FOR LIBERATION. I ms
taken to the Concentration Camp at FLOSSMBORG in Bavaria on the 21st February 1944}
and put into solitary confinement.
The Carno Commandant was OEKRSTUKMBANNFUHRER SS KSGLER, a native of AILGAU,
district of Bavaria. His Adjutant ms OEERSTUEMFUHRER MUMGARTl'JER of KNESTRINj he
was the real Commandant of the Camp, he alone looked after the prison cells as he ms
also in charge of preparing the prisoners for the SS Tribunal of FLOSSEITBURG, which
was in permanent sitting.	This Tribunal sentenced to death without the accused
attending. The executions took place in the prison courtyard by either hanging or
shooting in the neck. The victims were first taken to the bath-house; there
SCHARFUHRER WSIHB (a native of MAGDEBURG) ordered them to take off all their clothes.
He then tied their hands on the back by means of a piece of wire, took off their rings
and any religious insignia they had on them, tore up the photos of their families in
front of them and finally led them to the execution. WBIHE himself did the hangings.
The executions by shooting were carried out by STURMMANN WEISSENBOM, WILL (age 43j
electrician from BlSENACIyTHURINGIA, SS volunteer since 1935) and TOmTERSCHARFUIIRER
WOLFF, Gerhard (age L-6, employee of the gas and electricity works of WITTENBERG/ELBE -
Martin Luther's birthplace - and living there in the 1EINSTRASSE). In charge of
these executions was the Adjutant BAUMGARTNER. If the victims were Russians he often
had them whipped before the execution.
Also present were a civilian doctor from a place about 10 kilometres off
FLOSSENBURG, who was attached to the SS, and the SS dentist, who pulled the teeth
of the victims after death. The dead were then carried by ordinary prisoners on
trolleys to the crematorium, where they were burned, together with people who had
died of starvation or disease or maltreatment. The civilians were not allowed to say
a prayer or to give a farewell kiss to their dead comrades. Any suggestions of
that kind drew insults and sarcasm. Afterwards the SS shared out any valuables the
victims still possessed.
The prisoners who arrived at FLOSSENBURG from Special Courts or from outside
working gangs (mostly Russian and Polish Officers) were held in cells stark naked,
without towels, soap, blankets, toilet paper, heating, palliasses, very often 5, o or
7 in the same cell, without food or water and sometimes they had to wait in this state
four days for the execution.
After every execution, BAUMGARTNER, distributed cigars, tobacco mid 'schnapps'
to the SS who had participated.
The SCHARFUHRER YffilHS hanged at least twelve men per day. There were not as
many executions by shooting in the neck, but on the 4th September 1944} 132 Russian
Officers were shot by WOLF, and two Ukranian SS who came from the SS barracks for the
purpose.
The cell prisoners who had permission for a half hour or one hour's walk per
day were able to observe traces of the executions in the following way:-
The clothes of the victims were left in a heap on a trolley in the court-yard,
often for several days; in wet weather one could see the prints of nude feet from the
prison to the execution place; the blood in the gutter; and the particles of brain
scattered about.
When executions took place, the daily exercise was belated and shortened and
they tried to prevent us from looking around. Also one heard the shots and the screams
of the victims.
All cell prisoners were able to see the corpses being carried past their cell
windows for about 200 yards. Not only I but also the following prisoners have observed
all this; they were in single confinement also for a long time and will confirm all
this if one saw fit to interrogate them:-
Mr. GUSTAV CEIMIN, from LATVIA (RIGA) of cell 19﻿- 2 -
i
Capt. HMS LTOIDINd- from DETMAEK., COEEMHA.GEN'.
The Danish Vice-Consul in DANZIG - JOSRGER MOGENSM.
Mr. GREEN1,7ICH of the British Legation in SOFIA.
Lt.-Col. of the Yugoslav Army - HIMO DRAGIGH from SEMLDl, near BELGRADE
The Danish Officers of the British Service, MSKELSEN, HANSEN, LANSEN.
Also Messrs. SCHUSCHNIGG, Ex-Clmncellor of ikistria and the Prince of HESSE
who had a room each. They were not in cells, and being "better off than any other
prisoners, they could hear better what happened.
On the 9th April 1944, Easter Day, there arrived at PLOSSMBJRG, 15 Allied
Officers, who came from the prison of FRESHES (France). They had carried out special
missions and had been arrested in civilian clothes in France between June and August
1944. I was then in Cell 26; my neighbour on the right in cell 25 was a Lieutenant
of the British Airborne Infantry, GEORGES DESMAN, whose parents lived in BRUSSELS (he
■was tattooed a lot on his chest). On iqy left in Cell 2? there was an American
Lieutenant, John ... (l have forgotten his name); he was a Bachelor of Art of the
University of Paris, and his father was building autogyros (helicopters) for the U.S.
Navy in New York.
By means of morse we were in touch with each other every day. They told me
that they had been beaten and sentenced to death by the Gestapo in PARIS. They and
their comrades had been tortured in the cellars of the prison in the Avenue Foch
(property of ROTHSCHILD) and had received the same treatment which was meted out to me
in the same place (blows, kicked, whipped etc.)
Of the 15, there were 13 English, one American, and a Canadian Major. The
prisoner who brought us our food told us that the Major and the English Officer, who
had occupied cell 23, had been shot on the 12 th June, 1944, by the UNTEESCHARFUHRER HIES I
and MOHR, under the command of BAUMGARTNER. All these officers were in dark cells, had|
no outdoor exercise, had only the food of the ordinary prisoners, which meant that they
were starved to death; they received no treatment in case of illness; left their cells|
only every 15 days for a shower and a change of shirt. The shower lasted only 15
min. and they took it singly. They were shaved once a week, and their hair was cut
once in two months. Very often they were deprived of food and beaten by "WEIHS.
During December 1944 and January 1945, i.e. until the arrival of SCHUSCHNIGG, I
■was the most senior prisoner and was ordered to help in the distribution of food and
the maintenance of the central heating which was situated in the cellar of the prison.
So I often had the opportunity to talk with Capt. of Artillery, Harold BOWDEN, aged 37,
two children, of LONDON. He load been in the French campaign and at FLQBSEBBURG he had
cell No. 7. He had studied in PARIS and in 1942 had been sent there for the
Intelligence Service. He had been beaten by the SS so terribly that "his brain was a
bit upset. In cell No. 1 was LIEUTENANT JEAN WORMS of PARIS, son of the owner of the
firm of "La Maison Blanche", he was in the R.A.F. , Jew, and also on permanent missions
to France like BOWDEN. In cell No. 11 was LIEUT. PHILIPPE J. A1EHMTI. of JJO Liberal
Club, London, age 27. I have forgotten the names ofTEe" others, but the Englishman
GREENWICH and the Dane MOGENSEN, which I mentioned before, can complete this list,
because they were also in touch through morse. MOGHNSHN received often Red Cross
parcels and often he gave me books which I succeeded in passing on. All these
comrades of misfortune were hanged on Easter Thursday, 1945, under orders of BAUMGARTNER]
just ten days before our evacuation from FLOSSEHBURG to DACHAU.
On the first Saturday of October 1944, twelve Russian Generals were shot by
WOLFF in the prison court-yard. One of them wore the badges of a commander of the
Armoured Corps.
Three Polish women of the WARSAW RESISTANCE, one of them eight months
pregnant, were hanged on the 8 th January by WE HIE.
On the 11th January, two Polish children, 12 and 13 years old, were killed
and dragged by their legs by WEIHE.
Through the cracks in our cell doors we could see the prisoners condemned to
death pass by’on their way to the executions. Mr. CELMINS, whom I have mentioned
before, can confirm this. Later on one could see the return of the corpses on the
trolleys.
My work in the central heating cellar enabled me to see there some
instruments of torture, such as whips, oxentails, knotted ropes, cat o' nine tails.﻿- 3 -
<
as well as parts of English, French, Russian and Belgian uniforms. During one
atccution I was locked in my cell, hut when I went into the cellar afterwards I found
■bits of jaws and teeth and also bits of brain still sticking to frames which the
SS had not burned completely in the incinerator. I often heard screams and groans
from the coal cellar which was situated under the prison court-yard but I ms never
able to find out more about it.
I would like to mention especially the Prince of HESSE. He was very friendly
with the SS WOLFF, WEIHE and WEISSENBORG-. He was also a great friend of the
Commandant, who paid him courtesy calls every week. Before his arrest he 3md been
an SS General.
With reference to the tortures to which I had been subjected in LILLE and
in PARIS during the interrogations about my case, I would like to reserve my detailed
statement until my return to France. I will just say here that I ms not spared
anything on behalf of the Gestapo; hunger, oxentails, thumb screws, broken teeth,
fetters. I am at the disposal of the Allies for all this information, and after
having seen ny family again, I am prepared to accompany a mission to FLOSSHNBURG.
I have made this statement as a solemn declaration and I demand that justice
be done.

..........Apres la liberation, un de mes anciens co-detenus de
Flossenburg, un politique allemand, KARL STERFLINGER, informe de mes
connaissances en anglais vint_me demander un service. Pour une
affaire quelconque, il avait ete mis h I'Arresthafts (prison) de
Flossenburg en Decembre 1944 et en etait ressorti h la mi-janvier
1945. Pendant son sejour en prison, il avait partage la cellule
d'un officier anglais, ce dernier lui avait dit que 17 autres de ses
camarades, de meme nationalite et du ijteine service (special service
brigade) etaient dans la merae prison. Get officier avait demande h
Sterflinger de lui fournir, lorsqu'il sortirait de cellule les moyens
de s'evader, ce que notre allemand fit trfes loyalement, mais 1'entre-
prise etait trfes difficile, si non impossible et il ne semble pas qu'il
y ait eu rneme une tentative; en outre, il lui donne I'adresse de sa fatnille
en angleterre avec mission de donner des nouvelles dtes que possible.
Get Officier etait authentiquement britannique, il^m'est malheureuse-
ment impossible de vous fournir son identite, ma memoire etant devenue
trfes inegale, h la suite d'un acces de typhus, mais je puis plus simple-
ment vous mettre en rapport avec Starflinger.
Ce dernier, par des renseignements precis (il avait
quitte Flossenburg avec moi le 26 janvier 1945) savait que son ancien
camarade anglais de cellule avait ete extrait de I'Arresthaus aved les
17 autres detenus vers la fin mars pu le debut djavril, selon une methode

T know that at that time there were about 6 to SOOO detair
5T Fi i L .(> ’R (mothercamp) itself and about oOOO more th
Komandos outside, unongst these ther were a majority of
and Tchecks and the other of all nationalitys. I had
helpers who were themselves detainees and worked as dent
SutMdeKommndos. The n .nee of these dentists are MM >
dence I do not know and WILLIE, -gon, who came from the
and whose xexact adress I do not know. I had llso a Russiax.
under my professiomi^ontrol^	nQt occured mass .
tions during my stay in the camp, but I khow thetr have been ef
tioris and thoire was in this camp a crematorium but their .	-
gas-chamber. aas far as I know the deathrate was at that time
hie-h* it can be estimated at about 5G to 60 deaths a month.
~ ’	i have often seen prisonners being ill-treated by^jL
rers and S3 men whose n imes I do not know and I never have seen
beating the prisonners to death.
﻿MMMMh
On dpril 11th 1944 I was posted to the concentration camp of
. jIUTTHOF near Dantzig »her I worked as a dentist. This camp hid only
political prisonners, about 7500 nrisonners and the majority of this
prisonners were poles. From the point of vue of the material - lire and
treatment this camp was very good and these prisonners worked in the
germann irmy equipment plants wich were on the. spot.
-‘•he Lager Kommandant was Stubaf HOPPE whom I found good for the
prisonners I never heard the; contr^.ry. There I have seen people being
kifeked to the ground by the. Kapos; their w.^s a crematorium in this
camp and death sentenaes in this camp wss were executed. I hn.ve no
notions wat so ever of the de .thr ;te after ill-treatment as this camp
was very large; personaly I can fix nothing about it but I understand
that the deathrate increes from day to day. The Kapos of this camp
were in majority.Poles and my polish helper, a lawyer named LEW .NDOwSKP
should be able in this case to give interesting informations about the
behaver of the Kapos in this camp to the prisonners. This camp has t
than been enlarged and the strengh of detaineses increesed to
40.000 men and majority were jews and it was not possible to accomo-
date this prisonners in the C-.mp itself so they were distributed in
the outside Kommandos. In general these people look very bad and thlr^^
food aws also very bad and the deathrate was very high. 8xk0 The 'S.
in this camp was Haufsturmfuhrbr Dr. HEIDI., who has also several do
tors under his control.
I left that camp on January 17th 1945 and was posted to
LaUEKBDHG- in Pomerania with my equipment .s the c .mr had to be eva-
cuated and the camp w-.s itself moved to the ire^ of Lauenburg exactl
to EINZELLaGEBN.
Later I run away to Dantzig than by sea and arrive in the xrr
island of RIJEGHN were I Was ordered to Neungamme. T went then to
Neungumme vsfere I stayed caly for two days and then on the ad of may 4
I was taken prisonner. ./hen I arrived in Leungamme the camp was alr4
dy- evacuated and as far ,.s T know the prisonners has been taken to 1
the area of LUBBEGK. I also heard that the remaining ill people had
been taken away by the Swedish red-cross.
I can swear to you that I.never ill-treated a prisooner. as
a man and as a doctor I always did my duty.
This is all I can state.

1. The stataaeat that you attached with the
above minute was oi considerable interest but the above
camp is no\/ beii\, oealt with by the Ainei’ican » ar Crimes
authorities, to whora I have passed the statements
concerned, retaining one coxxy in this ofiice.
2. It is fairly certain that the , merioan
authorities will ask for the delivery of Heinrich IVi'Z
both for interrogation and a possible accused in the
FLOCCJaffililiG Concentration Cra p case, and perhaps you would
be good enough to ut me know where he is now located and
what nations are requiring him as a war cxdminal as he may
have been concerned in other concentration canpo not in
the nerican none.
3. as the statement of Heinrich HJTZ v/a© taken
by the elgian ,<ar Crimes authorities, it woixM be
advisable to ask for his present whereabouts and whether
he can be released to the ritish ; ennanently, or taaporarily
for interrogation purposes.

Subj . My delegating to the concentration-camp Flossenhtlrg
Ref. Order of the lippische lard esregierung-Landespolizeidirector
Alt.Cd.Bo.366/45"
On summons I declare as follows:
At first I declare that I have been examined in this matter as well
by ximerican as by British authorities resp. that I had to declare
myself by writing about all circumstances. At last two gentlemen of
the British Secret-Service fro m Be mold, assi ted by Mr. peter
Rbmer interpreter, were in my office at Bad Salzuflen and haVe
ashed me in this matter by word of mouth. I handed over to these
officials my written declaration and since that time I did not hear
anything concerning this subject. This was May 1945, I don’t knwo
where the respective report are now.
Concerning the matter:
ii
October 8th 1943 the Burgermeister of Bad Salzuflen, then my supe-
rior handed over to me an order according to which I. was to be
detached to the concentration-camp Flossenburg/Oberpfalz the 10.10.
43. This order came from the Rei/chssic^erheitshauptamt at_Berlin
via Kriminalpolizeileits'telle Hannover, to which I then pertained as
a msmber of the municipal Kriminalpolizei, to the Burgomeigter. From
the first moment I resisted in my heart against thig charge. But ■
I could not oppose against it as I then would be.summond to trial -
before a SS- and police-court j, There was no statement in the, order,
with what sort of service I was to be charged at Flossenburg. This
was communicated to me at my arrival, when I had to report myself
at the commander of the camp, SS-Obersturmbannfiihrer Max Koegel,for
beginning my service. He declared to me that I had to relieve the
criminal-secretary Willy Fassbendsr from the Kriminalpolizeileit-
stelle Cologne, who was »5 years as a criminal-offical in the con-
centration-camp Flossenburg. I was detached to department II for
service. My occupation 'was the administration of the acts of the
prisoners, admittance and dismissal of prisoners, removing .to the
Y/ehrmacht and the settling of matters from other authorities for
instance divorce- and alimony-matters. I had only to handle with--^
pure administration-affairs.
' I had nothing to do with the guarding oZ'the prisoners. This was
performed by ‘ two companies faffen-SS, which pertained also to the
camp-commander.
Leader of the concentration-camp was the Hauptsturmfiuxr :r Fritseh,
camp-surgeon Sturmbahnfuhrer Drfmed. Schnabel.
I already mentioned that I resisted in my heart against all what﻿<rn3mm
fv
^ % •
happened, in a concentration-campj I therefore went iyt 'the coir 8$, r
two days after my arrival and declared to him that Twalg not . .Uv^ed
for a concentration-camp. I also declared that I was' sick arid I could
not agree with the diet of the camp by reason of an operation of the
stomach.
I was then examined by the camp-surgeon Dr. Schnabel. 1 also told him
my foaling and it seemed that im would appreciate my situation and
reported in my favour about my state of health. Attaching his report
D re-quested for my removal to the ' Sicherheitshauptamt at Berlin. But
it lasted- till the end of February when 1 was relieved by the Kriminal-
oberassistent Konrad Blomberg from the municipal hriminalpolizei at
Bielefeld. I will also mention that I left no stone' unturned in these
four months for getting out of the camp. So I wrote songs letters to my
comrade, Kriminalsekrctar Meier , Bad Salzuflen and begged that he
night cause the burgerm ister caring for my reentering my former ser-
vice via KriminaTpolizei'leitstelle Hannover by stating that ho could
not perform alone all the service. I even wrote to the leader of the
Kriminalp©lizeileitstelle Hannover, Oberregierungsrat Linnemann, him-
self and did not conceal that I would perish morally if I had to stay
longer at Plossenbiirg. .
At' last I will mention that I wore at first in the camp my civil clo-
thes while all others members of the Waffen-S8 wore uniform. It seeded
that the camp-leader did not agree that I was the only civilian in the
camp. He therefore caused that I had to go to Berlin, Bsfcl .idungskammer
of the Sicherhfcitspolizei.'/hen returning from Berlin to Flossenburg I
visited my family at Salzuflen for two days. It is very probably that
1 then was seen by some perspns who are not inclined .to me by reason
of my office. They now propagate the. rumour in denouncing me in a low
manner that I was member of the Gestapo or of the SS. )"
L declare herewith once more that I became member of the EfSDAP in 1938
but that I was never an active member and that I had no office. I be-
longed neither to the S3 nor to the SA, nor was I a member of the
Gestapo. But I belonged before and during my service as a police-man
to 'the Free-Trades-Uwion, before 1933- At last I was member of the
Schrkder-Verein, cancelled/;after 1933.
I can even now appoint trustworthy and reliable men as witnesses for
my political opinion, with whom I imdertained years ago against'the
Nazi-system. I denominate especially the actual Felice- major August
Jeuschede, leader of the police, Detraold with whom I was in active .u . ;
service before 1933 at De‘mold and whom I visited often after 1933*
He can witness that I was never a follower of the'nazis.
I was no official of the Gestapo^ that shows the fact that I belonged
from—1^23 to 1936 to the uniform-wearing .police and was then removed
tojth.: Kriminalpolizei Bad Salzuflen. There 1 was continously at ser-
vice and 1 belong to it continously since 1936. This will be seen from
my personel-acts. At present I.am detached for Lemgo for service. That
is all what I have to say in this matter.

Concentration camp of Flossenburg.
Vkn the 16th of September 1940 I was committed to the Floseenhurg
c^Rntration camp as a political prisoner. At my arrival in the camp
I was received with heatings, and the next day I was assigned to the
work detail in the quarry, were I was exposed for nearly three years to
heavy work and mistreatments from the SS. I can now report something about
this terror I lived through which I shall never forget. I myself once re-
ceived 25 lashes from Oberschafuhrer GRUBERj from Untersturmfuhrer SCHIRHER
I received once 20 lashes with a rawhide whip because I had lost the heel
iron from my right wooden shoe. Schaifuhrer ABEL always had a dog along and
set the dog on inmates frequently. Abel was known as one of the most feared
detail leaders. It was his hobby to thrash us inmates with the dog whip.
Unterscharfuhrer WINKLES beat me with a wooden club in such a manner that
blood was streaming from my mouth and nose, the reason being that Winkler
found a roll of chewing tobacco on me when he conducted a search. I saw
how other inmates particularly Jews , were driven into the guard chain and
then shot by the guards. In the year 1942 only 8 Jews were left in the
camp.
In the night from the 14th to the 15th of June 1941 we were awakened
At 2 AM by the block leader and driven to the roll call place with sticks
and blackjacks. We only learned at the roll call place what was the matter;
two Piles had escaped; all block leaders as well as the commandant and the
camp leader were present; the Poles had to stand formation all by them-
selves and atand at attention and they were being worked over with black-
jacks while standing at attention by the block leader who also kicked them.
The camp leader AUMEIER ordered the German and Czech inmates to go th their
blocks to fetch blankets. Except for the Poles all inmates were permitted
to bring blankets to the roll call place. At 8 Oclock in the morning an
order came that all inmates except the Poles were to go th their blocks
and remain there. After the Poles had stood at attention for 36 hours the
two escaped Poles were brought baek in the camp as corpses with an auto.
The heads had been severed from both and shown to the Poles at the roll
call place. After standing at attention for 36 hours the Poles were dis-
missed, 47 bodies remained on the roll call place.
It happened frequently that inmates escaped; all inmates had to re-
main standing on the roll call place until they had been brought back to
the camp dead or alive. If he was brought alive he received a sign on
which it said I am back from my recuperation furlough, at the camp gate.
When the escaped inmates came back into the camp, the inmates band played
and he had to walk around the whole roll call place so that all inmates
could see him. After this ceremony he would be placed over a block in the
center of the roll call place where he was beaten with two rawhide whips
on the buttox until the camp phjtsican in attendance would order it stopped;
I myself have counted once in such a case 75 lashes.
It was on a Sunday in July 1941. All we inmates had to stand formation
on the roll ca.ll place; report leader Oberecharfuhrer SCHMATZ made the follow-
ing speech: Germany now finds itself also at war with Russia . Do not hope
for Germany to lose the war. Schmatz' said further: and if we should really
lose the war, I shall have"left enough time to set up a machine-gun, to light
a cigerette and shoot all of you before hand. All this Schmatz said in a speech
to about 5000 inmates.
In June 1943 I came with a transport of prisoners to Dresden where I
had to work building barracks. In October 1943 I c^me with a transport from
Dresden to castle Hirschstein which was in the vicinity of Meissen. We had to
fence in the castle with barfeed wire and to build a guardhouse. I saw once how
scharfuhrer ABEL set his dog which he always had with him, on three Italian
- 1 -﻿inmates and when the three inmates took more and more protection from the
dog in a nearby lying woods, all three of them were shot by Abel and a
^ rottenfuhree.
tin Flossenburg a rifle range had been set up next to the crematory and
myself witnessed .1000 Polish inmates being shot there. I frequently saw
osed autos drive into the camp and civilians get out who were led to the
rifle range by the SS and	shot there. Humors in	the camp had it that the
civilians were all Czechs	who had been	brought	by car. The shootings of	in-
mates were undertaken in most cases in the evening; when they did S5X take
place during the day when we were in the blocks we received the order from
the block eldest to lie down on the floor with the face down so that none
would be able to look out	of the window	to see something. When the shootings
took place in the evening	I saw from my	bed the	block leaders lead those	who
were to be shot to the rifle range.

For^iva roe,Sir., for the delay In sending you this information. But not
baaing an Alsatian, I did. not know where and to whom to send it. I must
apologise too for having forgotten the greater part of it, as after the
events below I became seriously ill with typhus.
I was a political deportee and during the last stages of the war I w&s
interned in the camp of Zivodau which depended on the camp for men at
Flossenburg in Czechoslovakia. I was found guilty of complicity in the
blowing up of a goods wagon loaded with bombs enganeered by several of my
camr, mates, and was condemned to solitary confinement. For the carriing otii
of this sentence I was sent to the frightful prison in.the camp of Flossen
burg -this happened in Oct.44, but there was an air raid on the camp and
the prison by ®- miracle wss not hit although there were several very wide
cracks in the walls which were quickly repaired. As I was the only woman
in the prison, the warders who had received definite orders to maltreat me
were for not apparent reason ''quite good" to me.
As a result I was able to keep the bed clothes on my bed which enabled
me to hide a fairly large crack hidden under my bed,and my neighbours bed
was stretched along the length of the wall on the other side, thus hiding
it completely. I could,therefore, communicate with my neighbour, an Bng-
11sg Officer, who spoke fluent French,-he was avaiting a sentence of deaeh
to be carried out and gave me hia name and his adress.Alas, I can not lon-
ger remember more than his christan name: PHILIPP, and his name which I
can't remember or garaotee to be exact: ARI(?)ETT (or (?)ARLETT),Hls
adress: artlaan( ?) ,,rational Club of London. Commander of a group of p&rs.^
chutists' working in the Clermont-Ferrand area. He had bean denounced and
arrested, as wall as the 10 or 15 of his group when he was hording a train
at a station whose name I forgot. I don’t remember how they got to the
camp.
mh-9 reason for which they were awaiting a slow death was as follows:-
These 11 or 14 men were shut up, one to a cell,all in a row- The execu-
tioners started with Ii° l(rny neighbour’a, the leader) , with N°14 as the
last to be dealt with.They started by torturing 1°1,leading to a slow
death at the end of 5 weeks.Than they killed this partyr,they announced
it to ell his comrades as well as the fact that they were starting on the
second,and so on. All knew themselves to be condemned. Everyman counted
the days-all suffered from hunger and thirst and cold,and from lack of
news of the outside world. But not one raised s murmur or lost his smile.
However,from the news that did reach the camp, and from the obvious lock
of .Icy on the wonder/ faces and the diminishing ferocity of their treat-
ment, it was easy to guess that events of great consequences were occuring
at that time. I did,in fact, manage to tell ray neighbour of the possibili-
ty of the Allies reaching the camo in the near future and stir up some
hope,little enough alas for life at. that time.Thanks to a code known only
to themselves, they could by irregular taps of their knuckles on the Walls
communicate this news from one to the other. I don’t know if these men,
whose courage was so emaemplary and who in spite of all crual sufferings
hid their feelings from their executioners,who are still alive,Their
death was almost certainly hurried on.
I don’t know if this information concerns the group of parachutists
whom you mention in the newspaper of the 13 Sept.But I would like to
expre.ss the hope that such information ps I have been able to give you,
little enough alas,will enable you to identify them. This officer begged
me to pass on the message to all my fellow women exiles hoping that if
one came out alive she would pass it on. But,alas,I was struck down with
■typhus and then dysentry in that very cell,and was carted off to the camp
infirmary where I was unable to communicate with any of my friends.﻿mOFORWi "H"
