Ill-treatment of a British Airaan.
In the middle of arch 45,during .an. air-raid on
Harburg**,7ilheliTiSBurg,an English aircraft was shot down
near the Concentration Camp lleuenggonme„Two or three
British Pilots saved themselves with the- aid of their
parachuts.One of them landed near the barbed-wire of
the Concentration Gamp.It was about 12g.oo or 13*oo hrs.
Since I was acting as a fire-man (being/prisoner of the
Concentration’ Camp) I noticed that shortly after
the pilot had been picked up,3S-0bersturaifi!arer
illtreated the captive with kicks.Ihe pilot was
evidently wounded.I do not know whether tm.is was due
to the jumping or the ARP - shooting.
The British Pilot was brought to the SS-Camp and on the
wa y to it he was constantly kicked by ‘lUiAHS*
I am informing you about this matter because I do not
wish such atrocity to remain unpunished.

I — 1/3.	EDDELAK (HOLSTEIN), am 24th .AUgUSt ,	1945*
TO
Military Government
He i d e.
I have learned that the former S3—Oberscharfuhrer	s.e..
of Pahlhude has been arrested and transferred to Neumunster.
With regard to this Reese I am able to report the following:
I was in the eoncentration Gamp Neuengamme near Hamburg as
political prisoner. In September, 1944, about 1200 men were __
assembled as a unit for outside work; they were housed in the
freeport of Hamburg, that is,in an old harbour shed at the
Dessauer shore. I was one of these 1200 men. SS-0berscharfuhre2
Reese was apointed report leader of the oamp Dess aue r sho re.
In that capacity he was deputy of the commanuaiat, an““SS—	„
Qbersturmfuhrer.
The first thing Reese did was to select from among the priso-
ners a number of professional criminals. He appointed theses
as so-called "capos'", i.e. leaders of working gangs. He pixt
in a prisoner of the name of 3 u h r e n as camp corpor§_;
the man was a professional criminal No.8903 or something like
it. I do not remeifoer the number exactly. This Suhren,a crimi-
nal sentenced to detention for reason of public safety /siche-
rungsverwahrung/ was first of all responsible for the distri-
bution of food to the inmates of the camp. It was generally
known that Reese together with Suhren purloined a considerable
part of the camp's food to sell it for personal benefit. In
view of this the prisoner 3uhren, a rough and bruta^ bully,
could act as he liked in the camp; he maltreated tie inmates
in the most inhuman manner and was in everything -’teese s
right hand man. Reese himself was just as trut*i* i once
witnessed Reese kicking an inmate with his	x ®v,“:p
while the latter was standing on the Platfo;r1fv,°r£r;Jfm^aving
with the result, that the inmate fell on to the	o Tonf
one leg broken and the other sprained. The man was for a long
time iS hospital and left it a cripple, f	the	Sard! ’
limped about in the camp and was eaiPloy®L®“e?PS|ates Kth
On the same occasion Reese hit about another ^ inmates with
a thick stick so violently that some of them were lert dying
senseless on the landing.﻿-2-
During the reporting in the evening Reese meted out punishments
almost every day. The inmates only wore their very'thin working
suits and felt very oold due tho undemorishment. They collected
empty paper cement bags and other pieces of paper and made them-
selves paper waistcats. wuite unexpectedly investigated and
cruelly git all those with a rubber-hose over the head who had
made themselves such paper underwear. Re was assisted in this
by the professional criminals he had appointed as foremen*
There were mostly foreigners in the camp Dessauer shore* I myself
had no nationality /Staatenloser/, of Norwegian descent, and was
inmate of the camp because formerly I fought in the Polish Army
as Officer and because during the war I had taken an interest
in the well-being of the foreigners working in Germany*
The few Germans in the camp were without exeption professional 4
criminals and Reese made use of them to club down the foreigners.
The foreigners against whom Reese proceeded in so inhuman a manner
were all transferred to a concentration camp for negligible
offences. There were 40 Belgians in the camp who had been arrestee*
as hostages. There were French officers who had done nothing at
all. They had been discharged from the French Army and on their
way heme had been arrested and taken along by the German Gestapo
in France. Here in Germany they were put into a concentration
camp and some of them were systematically tortured to death*
At the beginning of November Reese was transferred to another
unit for outside work, probably to Husum. I learned only recently
that he tortured te inmates at Husum in as brutal a manner as he
showed to us.
PreviQBly Reese acted at times as report leader of the women's
concentration camp at Neugraben near Hamburg. It was said that he
was Just as cruel to the women. Evening for evening he is said
to have beaten Jewish women with a rubber stick or rubber hose.
All in all Reese was a Sadist of the worst kind.
During his time, there was also an Englishman from the Channel
Island Guernsey in the camp Dessauer shore. He illtreated this
man ^iite particularly and beat him often. While he did so he
always shouted at the top of his voice that Englishmen were his
particular enemies and that they should be completely exterminate
The Police Officer in Heide, Wachtmeister Godbersen, told me that
Reese protests his innocence and that he says that he has a good
conscience. I refer to my to-day's report. The managment of
the camp Neuengamme appointed Reese as leader of the unit parti—
culaily for the reason that he excelled in special brutality and
savagery. Those were exactly the people that the Nazis selected
for leading posts in concentration camps.
Yours faithfully,

, 8 Corps District.﻿-TEJMSMCIQi
Gcmmandant of 'the English Military Government Detachment in
I a builder labourer, Emil COUMLIUR, born on 3/3/1906, son of
a carpenter, Prana OOMNLUIR, was taken into protective custody on
22 August 36 on the strength of previous convictions and because I had
taken part before the coming into power of the Was is in communistic
activities. On the 10th October 1936, I was sent to the Concentration
Camp at SACHSENHAUSW, nr BERLIN - ORANIENBUKG. As I entered the camp
with some comrades there was put in front of us a wooden platform on
which we had to stand. . Then the commandant by the name of KOCH, who
*
afterwards became the camp leader-of BUCHMiV/AID, chose three men among
whom I was and we were made to stand on this platform and each receive
25 strokes with a stick on our backs. V/hy, we did not know. Then we
had to lie down for a long time on the ground and then we went about
a 100 yards to the store for issuing personal clothing. There we
changed quickly and were taken to a barracks where there were some more
inmates. Next morning we were divided for work and this consisted
of carrying sand on a small railway |krn in length. There were about
60 inmates in our working party. ¥e Were detailed to 20 of these
railway trucks and we were divided so that on each truck there were
three inmates. Each truck had to be loaded in 3 to 2). minutes then the
work started. On the first truck a Blockfuhrer of the SS positioned
himself, and also one in the middle and on the last one. Each one of
these had a big stick and if the work did not proceed quickly enough
for his satisfaction they encouraged us with their sftcks. Later a
company was formed with the name SK. In this most of the new inmates
were put, including myself. Those in the SK did the most difficult
and hardest work and mostly at the double. In Summer those in the
SK wre given practically no water. Further, in the winter we had to
drink water in large quantities and they told us "in order that you
swine will parish more quickly and we get a little more room in the camp."
There was no break for breakfast. If the SK did not perform sufficient
work in the opinion of the particular block leader who was supervising
the work, he reported to the chief commandant, KOCH, and the SK got nothing
to eat for two days but had to ■'work just the same as on other days. In﻿In the evening after the end of work we had to provide "sport" for a
couple of hours. This consisted of jumping, rolling and running and getting
up and down. When the two days were over we were given all at once all
the food which had been due to vis during those days.On top of that,sport
continued so that in the end the inmates who could not bear all this were
sick over each other and some of them finally were lying about half or
conpiletely dead.
When on 7th Nov 1936 finally several inmates sought freedom during
the night through an underground tunnel on which they had been working
secretly, the whole camp had to parade suddenly at 7.30 in the evening
and had to stand strictly to attention in the snow, and run until 1.45,
half naked. Then, 12 of the inmates who had worked with the others
were called up and received, frozen as they were, 25 blows.
When some of the block leaders who were on duty on Saturday became
bored they went to a barrack room, out open the straw pallias, made a mess
of the beds and turned them over. They went away and returned in two hours
time.when they returned everything had to be in spic and span condition
again; if this was not the case, the inmates of the particular barrack
had to start doing"sport" until they were absolutely soaked with sweat.
When someone escaped and was returned to the camp he was nicely decorated
and a large drum was strung round his neek. All inmates of the camp had
to parade and a particular escapee had to parade through the camp banging
the drum aid. was followed by two inmates who carried a placard on which
was written the name of the particular inmate and underneath in large
letters "I salute you, I too have come back". After that he got 25 strokes
and 'was then put for a considerable time into a dark cell where often
it happened that he never saw daylight again. On Saturdays, as long as
the building was going on, we had to work just the same as on week days.
If an inmate reported sick and did not have a fever he was planished.
.ihen the camp was visited by a foreign commission, the inmates who were
already very ill were hidden in an owfc of the way place so that they would
not be seen by the conmission. In the banker there were some hooks with -
/ '
boards though which long nails had been driven. If one wanted to get some
information out of an inmate and he would not sxneak, his hands were hound
behind his back and he would be strung up on the hooks until he would not
only tell the S3 everything they wanted to know but in his pain and in
- 2 -﻿order to get away from the hooks he would admit much that he never even
*saw being done. In oachenhausen it was usual for the guards of the SS
who were standing round the working place to single out inmates and say
to them "go and fetch me seme paper" or if one of the inmates did not
remove his hat quickly enough, the particular guard would tear it off his
head and throw it to the other side of the guard fence and then say to
the inmate "there you are you swine, go and get your hat". The particular
inmate would probably in that moment of consternation not think of the fact
that his life was at stake if he crossed the fence and would go unsuspectingly
to get his hat. At that particular moment the next guard would wait and as
soon as he had crossed the fence he would be shot down. On the strength
of this, that guard would be relieved and receive straight away 4 days' leave.
Another case was that of a certain Jupp Bucheh from Dusseldorf, who
afterwards hanged himself. This man suffered for thirteen hours the torture
known as "HAJMSGHLIE8ZEN" because he would not betray his comrades who had
escaped. "KRUMSCHLIESZEN"consists of making a particular inmate lie down
on his stomach and then his hands a feet would be bound with a thick rope
and thus he had to lie on his stomach. After being release^ the bound man
could not even walk straight for several weeks. There were several more
methods of torture in the Camp SACHSEMAUSEN. The people mainly responsible
in this camp were the then Commandant KOCH, the camp guard Oberstunofuhrer
SCHDESLIH and the Raportfuhrer Oberscbarfuhrer KAMEE from 3AA0HY.
On 12 December 38 a draft was sent to a small camp NEOENGAMME, near HAMBURG,
in order to start work on the building of a large camp, among which I was also
with a 100 other inmates. We lived then in the old	. We had
to do clearing up work and building barracks under the supervision of the
S.S., In 1940 the camp was filled up to the strength of 1200 and then things
started properly. In all this stick beating played a big role, under the hand
of a certain Oberscharfuhrer by the name of HENKLER, who was also at the same
time Rapportfuhrer.	At that timethere only existed people in full health and
the dead. All others were unnecessary. If somebody became sick at work or
while marching to work he was thrust into a tub "full of putrid water and then
had to continue with his work, wet as he was, and on top of that after that
was over he received 25 strokes. As the camp got bigger and bigger, we were
divided into rigid work parties and I went to the interior builders as assistant.
- 3 -﻿£pe day I vras working on building of the floor when my pipe fell out of
my pocket and as I was trying to put the xipe back into my pocket the then
block leader MULhER happened to pass the window and saw that I had the pipe
in my hand so he took my number and made a report about me for smoking while
at work. 14 days later I was called to the office of camp leader 3CHUPELIK
and got as punishment the following: In the morning for 1^- hours and afternoons
for one hour I was strung up by my back with bound hands. When 1 had been
hanging for about 20 minutes I got very sweaty and absolutely soaked. While
hanging one was suspended about 50cm from the ground. When I had finished
my time and had been taken down I went to pick up my hat but I couldn't manage
because I had no sensation left after this affair in that I could not lift
my left am for four1 months because I had the most terrible pain in my shoulder.
later in 1944 typhoid broke out in the camp of OTDMGMME through lack
of cleanliness. Innumerable Russians died out of 1100 which had been imprisoned
about 700 and from the others, those whom they were not certain about were
hosed down. Whether they were Russians, Germans, Poles or anybody else it
was all the same. They always said the same thing:"you swine,you are not
worth keeping alive so that you can gorge, you will be destroyed anyway".
At that time they started the building of the regulating channels of the
Elbe. When in the morning we marched to work and an inmate happened to attempt
to grasp fag end which was lying one or two paces outside the marching guard
picket, they waited till just the moment when he was about to pick the fag end
up and then shot him because the sentries were only about 10 to 15 paces away
from each other and always had their rifles at the ready.	The work at
the ELBE consisted of carting mud from morning till evening in small trucks
and railway cars. There was no such thing as getting tired. The guards on
the ELBE stood in different places in a triangle and if anyone of the inmates
got on the train one of the guards would quietly move back a little so that
he would be in line with the other guards and the inmate would now be outside
the guard picket. Then suddenly a shot would sound and the particular inmate
would be either dead or wounded, in which case he would be left lying their
until the provisional military commission, which consisted of S3 appeared from
the camp to make a finding that the inmate had got outside the guard pickets.
- 4 -﻿..'"hen the commission went away again, the guard would once more take up
his old place so that the dead or dying inmate would really be inside the
guard picket. These punishments were made from day to day and if you were
not not very much alert you could be sure that sooner or later you would
become a victim of the murderous lust of the S3.
On 31 December 41 My mother died, followed on 4 Mar 42 by my brother
and then on 6 March by my father. On that occasion I was tolds
'How you need not go back home. What do you want to get outside
for now".
I took all this very much to heart, but could not say anything and had to
keep control of myself as an incautious word world have meant death for me.
Therefore I said nothing and asked nothing. It would be too much to
describe everything else about the years I spent as inmate there and God
knows how much more I might have had to bear. Therefore I want to finish
very quickly.
Lately I was. in the camp at BREMEN. There we had to build U-boat pens.
When I myself became ill I was sent back to the big camp at KEUENGAMME, near
HAMBURG, and spent my last period by being employed in looking after the
cleanliness of the camp and that the approach road and the flower beds were
in order. I gat this job from camp leader S3 Obersturmfuhrer TUHMMN.
I was made responsible for this and if he went through the camp and found
a piece of paper which perhaps somebody had only just dropped I would get
a few blows on the head.. ?/hen 1 had suffered this for a time I went one
day to the camp leader TUHMAHN and asked him to allow me to relinquish this
post. As soon as I had said these words I had already received a few more
blows and was chased out and he yelled after me: "don't you dare let me see
you here again or I will knock you green and blue". What was I to do, I Unrl
to suffer all this as I was only an inmate and had to bear all this to get
away with my life. To return for a moment to the executions of EUSMANN,
DOT3SMAN and PAULY. There were in the camp 26 huts. In every hut one of
the inmates was appointed as block overseer and he was responsible for seeing
that the huts were absolutely in a clean condition; if this was not the case
it was not the other inmates but that particular overseer who was held
responsible and it was often the case with camp leader TUHMANN, when this﻿happened the overseer would be publicly strung up in the cellar and two
or three other block overseers would be detailed by TUHMWN to carry out
his punishment on the victim under supervision of the SS. There was no
' such thing as refusing. He who was hesitant staked his life. There were
in the mortuary one to two hundred corpses who had become green and blue
from lying there. It was my job with another inmate to load these corpses
0
X*
on to a wagon to the crematorium where they would be burned by two more
inmates in the presence of SS unterscharfuhrer BBAEKE. One evening at
about 1030 I was awakened cnee more and I was ordered to cart a few more
bodies. I think it was in April that I arrived with the other inmate
at the cellars and had to load the bodies of six women who were lying there
naked and ted been hung, and had to carry them to the crematorium under
supervision. As we came back a great panic had started in the cellar.
«
The camp leader TUHMANN had been wounded in the face and was bleeding as
I could see. What is certain was that the camp leader had ordered somebody
to be locked up in a cell and had ordered them to come out one by one naked
and had killed them by a shot in the neck. One of the victims must have
defended himself and thus THHMANN had been wounded. As a result of this
the bunker was immediately closed by SS TUHMANN. DHUSSMAN ordered the
block leaders who were standing about to fetch hand grenades and myself
as well as the other inmates who had been employed in fetching the bodies
oould see the whole thing from a certain distance. We saw hand grenades
thrown in the bunker by a block leader in the S3 and when the bunker had
.been completely demolished we had to pick up the bodies from under the
wreckage and those not dead were shot dead by DHJSSMAN. Then we had to
carry away the bodies. The bunker itself was cleaned next morning by
inmates and consisted of block supervisors. The block had to be cleared
of clothes in the presence of the chief of the prisons clothing department.
The chief people talcing part in the whole affair were S3 Oberstumfuhrer
TUHviAKN, S3 Oberscharfuhrer DRUS3MAN, Block leader BHHNUS, S3 Unterscharfuhrer
SEIERABEt©, as well as Commandant PAUTHT. The prisoners in the form of
block supervisors who had to clear away the victims did not do thin on their
own account but were forced to do it by Obersturmfuhrer TUHMANH, Unterschar-
fiihrer DRU8SMM, as well as' commandant PAUTIN. If they did not cart away the
bodies they would not perhaps be alive today.

I (to not feel on my eonscious even the slightest guilt. I was from
2 Aug 1936 until 29 April 45 in protective custody. On 29 April 368

going to the 38 and would be incorporated in the SCKDEEBEStfAHRIMG-AHCEILUNG

barracks in HAMBURG. When we had been there a few days, it was rumoured
that the English army was coming and at 8.30 we were ordered to march
away. The troops of the S3 had four days rations and we 368 prisoners
had none. During the march we scattered in order to fall into the hands
of the English soldiers and so I stayed here in	until finally
I managed to find some work for myself with the contractor Peter H0R3TMAW
in EDEMDOKE1 and did my work industriously from five in the morning till
six or seven in the evening in order to build myself up again after the
long years of my custody and now I am here imprisoned because of the
obviously false accusations. I ask the British military government to
examine ray case in order that I might soon return to my work so that after
all the suffering which I have behind all these long years so that I can
lead a decent living, follow my work and later find a comfortable home.
Therefore I humbly ask once more to look into my case.

The a/m internee hid 'been an irsmte of Concentration Camps since
August 1936. Fie ms arrested chiefly for being a member of the Communist
Party.
Internee ms an inmate of CaAmMBURG-/SAC®ppiTH!SH for tvro years, '
and from Deo 1938 until the capitulation at Concentration Camp BBDKNGAliBS*
• In his seven years oonfinement at FEJM'-FiMtS, OOKHEIijUS has been •
able to inform himself of every aspect of life there, and he has been the
witness of every type of brutality committed therein.
In Dec 1944 eOBKELIUS ms made foreman of the inmates (Capo) by
Camp Goiamndant PJJLI, because he had by that tine served sire years at
HEUESG-AliCI!. For this reason he was arrested by the lilies.
In his capacity as Gapo, COHtT.LILB ms given the job of transporting
the dead 'inmates on a trolley to the Crematorium and on most occasions he was
permitted to visit the inside of the place, which was strictly out of bounds
to practically all inuhtes.
CGRMLITB states that during a single week this year he personally
conveyed 1400 inmates who hid cither been killed or died due to conditions
within the Chmp, orchis trolle3r to the Crematorium,
COMTSLlUC states further that he knew well all personalities
responsible for the Crimes committed in ICjUIMkili E.
CQRISELIUS should therefore prove to be an invaluable witness at a
trial of the leaders of KStEITGAI-D. There seems to be no reason to suspect
CORNELIUS of having assisted in the brutalities in his capacity as Capo.

tiK EGON OCHSHORN, bom on 19.2.1901 in MISCHKOW, lived in VIENNA XIII,
jfstrasse 212.	For six consecutive years he was an inmate of a number
of concentration camps specified below, Functioning at various periods
during that time as a camp clerk and senior of the block, his duties were
to write and file all reports. Ho was thus not only able to gain a first
hand insight into the extermination actions, but he also witnessed those
mass annihilations with his own eyes.

On the 29th of April 1945 I was freed by the American Amy at ALLAGH, a
gub-section of DACHAU. Of my already portly written memoirs I shall relate
for example the following facts which I witnessed personally.
B U C H E N W A L D
In November 1939, the Central Bureau for Concentration Camps in BERLIN-
ORANXENBURG, Amt D II, informed the Camp Commandant, that, since a monthly
schedule of 20,000 Polish Jews was to be sent to BUCHELWALD, care, was to be
taken for their quickest possible liquidation (murder). The Camp Commandantur
put this order into effect by the following methods:	The new-coming Jews
were immediately subjected to such sadistic maltreatment that more than
half were murdered on the day of arrival, while the surviving Jews wore
put into separate cages -where they were denied any sort of nourishment or water
and were bestially mishandled, so that they would die within 14 days. I myself
overhoard the Camp Commandant, SS Obersturmfuhror SCHOBER giving SS Haupt-
scharfuhrer HINKEMANN the order: "I want every day at least 600 Jewish death
reports in the Camp Office.1'
By An order of Camp Commandant SCHOBER issued to the SS men HINKEMANN,
KUBITZ and. ABRAHAM all University graduates and Rabbis wore taken to the Camp
gate and there those learned men, some of whom enjoyed world-wide reputation,
wero buried alive, standing up to their neck, dying a dreadful death.
The Camp Commandantur handed daily to the SS doctors a nominal roll of
prisoners who had to dio on that same day. They were brought to the sick
bay for 0 medical inspection, and wero murdered by an injection.﻿2
-AtllQ
The Camp Commandant gavo an order to tho "Capos"
chain of sentries where they were shot, This was
1st trying to escape".
to chase the Jews through
registered as "shot
DACHAU
The Jews were thrown alive into huge concrete mixers where they were
milled into pulp. This material served as street piaster,* hence, these
streets were commonly called "Judenstrassen" (jow-roads),
HIMMLER visited the Camp in March 1941. Seeing the accidental
treatment of a Jew in the sick bay, he issued the order that all Jews
reporting sick should be murdered.
G ROSS - ROSEN
Camp Commandant ANTON TOMANN gave the SS men the order to murder all
incoming Jews on the day of arrival. He himself stood at the camp gate, and
those whose faces displeased him wore separated into a special group, which
was then murdered in various fashions.
from October 1941 to August 1942 500 to 600 Russian Prisoners of War
were daily murdered by poison or gas. I myself ¥/as always present, since
I had to note tho appropriate numbers.
Russian civilians, allegedly "Kommissars", were daily brought in busses
to GROSS-ROSEN where they all were shot. All prisoners had to leave work,
parade on the parade ground and sing loudly whilst the executions were going
on.
Tho sport of Camp Commandant TOMANN, favoured in winter, was to have many
Jews daily thrown alive into a pit and to have them covered with snow until
they wore suffocated.
The order of Camp Commandant TOMaNN to the "Capos" on December 2nd, 1941,
was; "No Jew is to remain olive by Christmas".
A U S C H g I T Z - B I R K E N ^ U
I saw how newcoming transports of Jews marked for gassing arrived at
BIEKENAU station. I myself heard, the Political Officer of AUSCHWITZ giving
to the newcoming Jews misleading speeches and instructing them to take a bath
where instead of water gas was being inducted.
I saw how Dr MSNGELE always selected a small number of healthy looking ■
Jews, led them to the Camp and ordered them to write letters to relatives in
which they stated that they arrived at "MONOWITZ LABOUR CAMP" that they vrore
very well treated, that life there was pleasant aixl that work was easy and
finally advising their relatives to join the transports to the East. These
letters were all dictated. Those refusing to send such dictated letters
were immediately shot.
• I saw the lorries with the Jews marked for gassing arriving at the Gas
chambers and crematoriums. I saw ho?/ the Joy/s were bestially driven into
the undressing-halls.of the Gas chambers naked. I saw how these these
unfortunate were handed soap and towel as if they were going to both. I also
saw how, after the Gas chambers had'been stuffed with human beings, the
doors wore closed, a Gas bomb was taken out of a Red-Cross lorry, how the
Duty SS Officer handed tho bomb to tho SS man; how the latter put on his
reopirator, prepared the bomb and how he throw the lethal Gas bomb through a
hole in the roof of tho Gas.chamber, which looked from a distance like a
*﻿*•
o-hivo, and how he iram .diatoly roportod to tho Officer.
.fter the gassing had boon completed, the so-called SONDURKOMf.l'NDO
appeared who extracted tho golden teeth of tho dead Jews and shaved the
women s hair for further utilisation. The clothing of the gassed and the
burnt had to be washed and sorted by a special "AEBEITSKOMhANDO", to which als
mu J!uish WQmen belonged, and was then sent in separate waggons to BEBLIN.
Thus the German State literally derived an enormous income from the murdered
Jews#
The gassed Jews were brought from the Gas chambers into the adjoining
Crematoriums which had many hundreds of ovens. In each oven a man, a
woman and a child were laid, since experience had taught that such an
arrangement ensured the best method of burning them.
Prom the old BIRKSNAU Camp of block 27, whictj was occupied by prisoners
and was separated from the Gas chamber only by a wire fence, these mass
murders could be seen accurately. One could even hear the terrible cries
ior help of the desperate, and their shrieks of horror.
I once heard the Camp Commandant of AUSCHWITZ say: "Our system is so
terrible that no man in this world will believe it to be possible - even
should a Jew succeed in escaping from AUSCHWITZ and telling the world all
he saw. The world will brand him as a fantastic liar and nobody will
believe him.	J
Prom my experienco at the Camp Office in the Gipsy Camp (all the Gipsies
were likewise gassed), I recollect the following incident: At the end of
'<..rc ,	1943, a Gipsy was brought into the Camp, who according to official
documents and photographs had served as a Lieutenant of the German Wehrmacht
in this war. He showed all this to the higher S3 Officers who promised him
to intervene at Higher Authority. This Lieutenant learned all about the
?®S^ng	b^rninf* After four weeks a Colonel of the Wehrmacht appeared
in the oil ice m order to intervene on behalf of this Lieutenant. SS
Bapportfuhror SCHILLINGER could not prevent the Gipsy Lieutenant from
informing the Colonel about the occurences and tho mass murders of AUSCHWITZ.
This caused the Colonel to remark to the higher officers in the office in mv
presence :	v
"After all that happened at AUSCHWITZ it will evolve upon the
bS now to win the war as quickly as possible. p0r, if Germany were
t°	the war’ then lot us 'be assured that after all that happened
at AUSCHWITZ - certainly no German will be left alive."
exception of w d °f.194^	almost all the Jews of Europe (with the
th? Hungarian Jews) had passed through the Gas chambers and
cteiiums, it was the opinion of the SS Puhrers of AUSCHWITZ that the
Gas chambers and crematoriums would now be destroyed. But they were
y mistaken. Already in September 1943 there arrived an important
of	engineers and technicians under the personal leadership
oi njjvlLLER. A technical Commission was set up with the task of enlarging
R	°X exbe:rm:lnQllo:n !n the Gas chambers and crematoriums from
0.000 to 40,000 per day. The building of these tremendous installations
was commonced as early as September. These new plans included the laying
rai4way di;r?Ptly to the Gas chambers. Since there were no more Jews
left in Europe, tho SS Officers believed that after the extermination of the
Jewish people it was now the turn of the Poles and Czechs.
I myself saw tho routine returns which wore rendered daily, fortniyhtlv
reporting tho lnass murders. Only that instead of tho
word Gassed the covering woid "SOMDERH'iHAHDELT" (specially treated) was used.﻿k-
I myself saw hew Hauptscharfuhrcr MOLL and five SS men seized 386 Jewish
children under 10 years, after they had been brought to AUSCHWITZ in lorries,
the hair, lifted them up, and shot them.
I saw how Dr MENGELE sorted out young Jewish girls and women, had them
brought to block 10, where Prof. Dr. SCHUMACHER used these unfortunate
a or medical experiments like rabbits or guinea pigs. On these girls various
experiments of a chirurgical nature wore practiced, artificial insemmination,
removal of the ovaries, removal of the breasts, sterilisation by means of
electricity and various other experiments. Also young Jewish men were
experimented upon, then they were brought together with young Jewish women
and the results observed. On completion of those experiments and after the
results had been obtained and noted, all these men were invariably gassed.
I myself saw a lorry with 40 completely naked Jewish girls being brought from
Block 10 to the Gas chamber. I also saw how several of these naked girls
jumped of the lorry but were immediately shot by the SS escort.
I saw how Dr MENGELE inspected from time to time the Jews in the Camp
and decided who was to be gassed.
I saw how the Camp Kommandantur ordered the Capos who were almost
invariably German professional criminals, to report to the Office where they
were told to murder far more Jews, otherwise they would bo dismissed.
In AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU there was a punishment block to which Jews were
arbitrarily brought. The senior of the block and later Camp senior -
FRANii DANIBS - erected a gallows in the yard and invited oveiy newcoming
Jew to hang himself, otherwise he would die a terrible death. Most Jews,
indeed almost all of them, complied, because it was well known that DANIES
promptly carried out the threatened tortures.
I once sow how the Camp senior FRANZ DANIES stopped a passing column of
a hundred Jews who were going to work, drew his notebook from his pocket and
said; "I, FRANZ DANTES, master of the life and death of the Jews, shall now
inspect you to see who will be gassed tomorrow." He marked 68 Jews in his
notebook. As the Jews knew that this meant certain death by gas, they
begged insistently for their lives. He said; "He of the 68 Jews who will
bear three blows on their neck with my cudgel, will be struck out, for he
is able to live." And really many of the unfortunate Jews bent down to
receive the blows on their neck. But most of the Jews fell down lifeless
under the murderous blows. Those responsible for the gassing were:
HESS, AUMEIER, SCHWARZ, HOFFMANN, SCHWARZHUBER, MOLL, TAUBER, PALLISCH,
SCHILLINGER.
W A R S A W
Though we arrived at Warsaw on 8th October 1943, i.e. 5 months after
the burning down of the Ghetto, we still found the deaibodies lying around
and. saw many hundred SS men searching the dead for valuables and removing
their gold teeth. In the bunkers of the houses we still found Jews living.
But since, by the clearing action the bunkers were then in danger of being
covered by the debris, these Jews emerged from their holes and were shot
immediately by the SS. Wo succeeded to provide some Jews with prisoner-
uniforms, They told us that some Jews had food supplies in their bunkers,
others had some brought to them at night by Poles, but against heavy payment;
and when the Jews had no more money or valuables these Polos betrayed them
to the SS.
The Commander, Hauptsturmfuhrer HERBETH, negotiated with me conceding
that the Jews need not work if they collect for him money. That was done.
The other SS, too, approached mo for the same purpose.﻿In December 1943 a typhus epidemic broke out in the camp.
BERLIN was
Tormed and ordered the liquidation of the camp as soon as the epidemic reached
a certain percentage. The Camp Commandant J3ERBETH, his deputy Unterstumfuhrer
HERTL and the S3 doctor Dr JOIST conferred how to arrange the murder of the
Jews. ' HERTL declared ho had experience in such matters. Once he had already
shot in a single night 13,000 Jews. The German aryan prisoners were already
removed from the camp to another building, and all preparations for the
liquidation of the Jews were in full swing. I approached the camp-senior
Walter WARZINIAK and offered to him and to the Commandant money and valuables.
WARZIIflAK accepted money for the Commandant and Dr JOBST only but for him I
would have to testify, if we survived HITLER, that ho saved 2,000 Jews. On
this basis the deal was made.
When at the end of 1944 the camp command thought the Bor novolt would break
out soon, they feared the Jews oould join it, and decided to liquidate the camp.
The commandant secured for the murder the active co-operation of the German
aryan prisoners as well. Machine guns were fixed around the camp. I had to
leave the orderly room, though being the chief clerk, but the other aryan clerks
were called to a serious conference. I heard that on Monday morning all
Jews were to be shot. We decided to defend ourselves and a group of 200 Jews
was formed who had to storm the Camp exit. The Camp Command suspected our
preparations and asked from the Police Commander of WARSAW reinforcements.
The Commander of the Police appeared himself in the Gamp and claimed that a
battle in the camp, in the heart of WARSAW, could load to an earlier outbreak
of the imminent Polish revolt. Ho, therefore, cancelled the'machine-gunning
but ordered the transport of all prisoners, by foot, to DACHAU. The trans-
port started on 28th of July, 1944.
At that time there were in the sick-quarters 248 Jews. They wore shot by
a SS detachment commanded by S3 Oberscharfuhrer Prana MIELENZ. I saw him
throw a grenade into the quarter.
The inarch from WARSAW to DACHAU was commanded by Hauptscharfuhrer KRAMMER
who let us have neither food nor water. So at DACHAU arrived 2,000, at least,
less than started the march. KRAMMER had the exhausted being shot.﻿APPENDIX "A"

STATBtJBNT OF EYEWITNESS
AK EGON OCHSHORN, bom on 19.'2.1901 in MySCHKOW, lived in VIENNA XIII,
ofstrasse 212. For six consecutive years he was an inmate of a number
of concentration camps specified, below. Functioning at various periods
during that time as a camp clerk and senior of the block, his duties were
to write and file all reports. Ho was thus not only able to gain a first
hand insight into the extermination actions, but he also witnessed those
mass annihilations with his own eyes.

On the 29th of April 1945 I was freed by the American Army at ALLACH, a
sub-section of DACHAU. Of my already partly written memoirs I shall relate
for example the following facts which I witnessed personally.
B U C H E N ¥	1 D
In November 1939, the Central Bureau for Concentration Comps in BERLIN-
ORi.NIENBURG, Amt D II, informed the Camp Commandant, that, since a monthly
schedule of 20,000 Polish Jews was to be sent to BUCHENWALD, care, was to be
taken for their quickest possible liquidation (murder). The Camp Commandantur
put this order into effect by the following methods:	The new-coming Jews
were immediately subjected to such sadistic maltreatment that more than
half were murdered on the day of arrival, while the surviving Jews were
put into separate cages where they were denied any sort of nourishment or water
and were bestially mishandled, so that they would dio within 14 days. I myself
overheard the Camp Commandant, SS Obersturmfuhror SCHOBER giving S3 Haupt-
scharfuhrer HINKEMANN the order: "I want every day at least 600 Jewish death
reports in tho Camp Office.»
By bn order of Camp Commandant SCHOBER issued to the S3 men HINKEMANN,
KUBITZ and ABRAHAM all University graduates and Rabbis were taken to the Camp
gate and there those learned men, somo of whom enjoyed world-wide reputation,
woro buried alive, standing up to their neck, dying a dreadful death.
The Camp Commandantur handed daily to tho S3-doctors a nominal roll of
prisoners who had to die on that same day. They wore brought to the sick
bay for a medical inspection, and were murdered by an injection.﻿2

Tho Camp Commandant gave;an order to the "Capos"
chain of sentries whore they wore shot, This was
list trying to escape".
to chase tho Jews through
registered as "shat
DACHAU
The Jews were thrown alive into huge concrete mixers where they wore
milled into pulp. This material served as street plaster; hence, those
streets were commonly called "Judenstrassen" (jew-roads),
HIMMLER visited the Camp in March 1941. Seeing the accidental
treatment of a Jew in the sick hay, ho issued the order that all Jews
reporting sick should bo murdered.
G ROSS - ROSEN
Camp Commandant AETON TOMANN gave the SS men the order to murder all
incoming Jews on the day of arrival. He himself stood at the camp gate, and
those whose faces displeased him were separated into a special group, which
was then murdered in various fashions.
rom October 1941 to August 1942 500 to 600 Russian Prisoners of War
were daily murdered by poison or gas. I myself was always present, since
I had to note the appropriate numbers.
Russian civilians, allegedly "Kommissars", were daily brought in busses
to GROSS-ROSEN v/hure they all were shot. All prisoners had to leave work,
parade on the parade ground and sing loudly whilst the executions wore going
on.
The sport of Camp Commandant TOMAfflM, favoured in winter, was to have many
Jews daily thrown alive into a pit and to have them covered "with snow until
they were suffocated.
The order of Camp Commandant TOMANN to the "Capos" on December 2nd, 1941,
was:	"No Jew is to remain alive by Christmas".
A U S C 11 W I T Z - B I R K E N i, U
I saw how newcoming transports of Jews marked for gassing arrived at
BIRKMAU station. I myself hoard the Political Officer of AUSCHWITZ giving
to the nowcoming Jews misleading speeches and instructing them to take a bath
where instead of water gas was being inducted.
I saw how Dr MENG-ELE always selected a small number of healthy looking
Jews, led them to the Camp and ordered them to write letters to relatives in
which they stated that they arrived at "MONOWITZ L/.BOUR CAMP" that they wore
very well treated, that life there was pleasant and that work was easy and
finally advising their relatives to join the transports to the East. These
letters were all dictated. Those refusing to send such dictated letters
wore immediately shot.
. I saw the lorries vALth the Jews marked for gassing arriving at the Gas
chambers and crematoriums. I saw ho?/ the Je?/s were bestially driven into
the undressing-halls.of the Gas chambers naked, I sa?v how these these
unfortunate were handed soap and towel as if they were going to bath. I also
saw how, after the Gas chambers had been stuffed with human beings, the
doors wore closed, a Gas bomb was taken out of a Red-Cross loriy, how the
Duty SS Officer handed tho bomb to tho SS man; how the latter put on his
respirator, prepared the bomb and how he threw the lethal Gas bomb through a
hole in the roof of tho Gas chamber, y/hich looked from a distance like a
■H-﻿W bee-hivo, and hovf ho iram.diatoly reported to the Officer.

burnt had to be washed and sorted by a special "AEHEITSKOlA'iAHDO", to which als<
300 Jewish women belonged, and was then sent in separate waggons to BERLIN*
Thus the German State literally derived an enormous income from the murdered
Jews.
The gahsed Jews were brought from the Gas chambers into the adjoining
Crematoriums which had many hundreds of ovens. In each oven a man, a
woman and a child were laid, since experience had taught that such an
arrangement ensured the best method of burning them.
Prom the old BIRKENAU Camp of block 27, which was occupied by prisoners
and was separated from the Gas chamber only by a wire fence, these mass
murders could be seen accurately. One could even hear the terrible cries
for help of the desperate, and their shrieks of horror.
I once heard the Camp Commandant of AUSCHWITZ say: "Our system is so
terrible that no man in this world will believe it to be' possible - even
should a Jew succeed in escaping from AUSCHWITZ and telling the world all
he saw. The world will brand him as a fantastic liar and nobody will
believe him.
Prom my experience at the Camp Office in the Gipsy Camp (all the Gipsies
were likewise gassed), I recollect the following incident: At the end of
March, 1943, a Gipsy was brought into the Camp, who according to official
documents and photographs hod served as a Lieutenant of the Gorman Wehrmacht
in this war. He showed all this to the higher SS Officers who promised him
to intervene at Higher Authority. This Lieutenant learned all about the
a'n^' 'kur:^;^nS• After four weeks a Colonel of the Wehrmacht appeared
m the office in order to intervene on behalf of this Lieutenant. SS
Rapportfuhrcr SCHILLINGER could not prevent the Gipsy Lieutenant from
informing the Colonel about the occurences and the mass murders of AUSCHWITZ.
This caused the Colonel to remark to the higher officers in the office in mv
presence ;	.
^ "After all that happened at AUSCHWITZ it will evolve upon the
oS now to win the war as quickly as possible. For, if Germany were
to lose the war, then let us be assured that after all that happened
at AUSCHWITZ - certainly no German will be left alive,11
Towards the end of 1943, when .almost all the Jews of Europe (with the
exception of the Hungarian Jev/s) had passed through the Gas chambers and
crematoriums, it was the opinion of the SS Fuhrers of AUSCHWITZ that the
Gas chambers and crematoriums would now be destroyed. But they were
greatly mistaken. Already in September 1943 there arrived an important
SS Commission with engineers and technicians under the personal leadership
of HDIMEER, A technical Commission was set up with the task, of enlarging
tho capacity ox extermination in the Gas chambers and crematoriums from
8.000 to 40,000 per day. The building of these tremendous installations
was commenced as early as September, These new plans included the laying
t’* #>2	31rec'fcly to the Gas chambers. Since there were no more Jews
left in Europe, tho SS Officers believed that after the extermination of the
Jewish people it was now the turn of the'Poles and Czechs.
I myself saw tho routine returns which wore rendered daily, fortnightly
and monthly to BERLIN, reporting the mass murders. Only that instead of the
word Gassed" the covering word "SONDEKELTIAHDELT" (specially treated) was used.﻿k-
^ I myself saw hew Hauptscharfuhrcr MOLL and five SS men seized 386 Jewish
children under 10 years, after they had boon brought to AUSCHWITZ in lorries,
* he hair, lifted them up, and shot them.
I saw how Dr MENGELE sorted out young Jewish girls and women, had them

rocoivo tho blows on their neck. But most of the Jews fell down lifeless
under the murderous blows. Those responsible for tho gassing wore:

PAULY MAS,abstract of evidence.
I was in charge of Neuegamme KL and other depending camps from 1'rovei3oer
1942 to the end.-Altogether there were about 5o.ooo detainees,men and
women,of various nationalities.The evacuation of the camps was ordered
by IS Beichsfiihrer to Hbherer 3S Fiihrer count Baseewitz-Behr in Ham-
burg and he gave instructions to ua.'Uie detainees were transferred to
Hamburg,loaded on shins there,-or they were brought to liibeck by trains
and there loaded on shins where they had to remain.
The organisation of the camp was as follows :
Dept.I,ADO,-Obetsturmfuhrer Totzauer
Dept. IT .Acceptin'? and releasing of detainees,-Hriminalsekretar Sppenburg
He equally kept the contact with the Hestapo.
Dept.TIT.,r®sponsible for the camp lifo.Chief :Thumann.
Dept. IV. , catering,-IturmbannfHhrer C-ehrig.
Dept.V.Hygiene.Dr.Tribinyky and dr.Kitt^
Dept.VI.,political education,-Seifert.
I had the right of punishment in the camp.The punishment was:withholding
of food up to 3 days,whipping (5 do 25 strikes by trunchhon'iand death.
I proposed the punishment to Druppenfuhrer G-lucks in Berlin and after
his confirmation I had them carried out.The death sentences I did not
proposed.T only reported the case to Glucks and he ordered the death pe-
nalty which I then had carried out.The camp inmates always were hanged,
SC men shot.The hanging wps done by camp inmates,? or5 of them,-in the
presence of Thumann,a physician,Totzauer and the chief of Dept.IV.In
my time only 5 camo inmates were hanged,.but other people were sent to
the camp by the Gestapo to be executed there.-In the crematorium there
were burned persons every 5 or 5 days,in winter about loo people,but
bever alive.Fany people died in the camp,as they came to my camp,after
having been for many years in other camps.••’here were no epidemics in my
camp.
THtH‘A]\tw is responsible for everything in the camp.T know that he held
people on roll-calls for many hours,! reprimanded him therefore and then
that practice was stopped.﻿V*-

On 29 Apr 45 I escorted 161 women to Pie ns burg, where they vere loaded on
board the ship "RheinfeIsland hande over to the police.
I often aas present in the camp at executions.It is not true that I
appointed the camp inmates who had to carry out the executions, that was
done by Ihumann.In. the nigth 24/25 Apr 45 I tos not present at the exe-
cution,! was in the ofiice at that time.Only at about 5 hrs I was called
by fiottenfiihrer Warnke to the bunker and I was told by him that one of
the men to be executed had attacked Ihumann, vhe re upon Ihumann threw^ hand
grenades into the bunker.When I came to the bunker,the shooting already
was over. I did not even see any corpses at that occasion. I did not kill
.anybody at that occasion.1 do not remember having hit a man with a spade
and split his scull.
Confrontation.
I'he witness IIMCENKO VLADIMIR,Yugp Slav liuetenant,was then Drought into
the room and he declares :
I recognize with absolute certainty this man as Dieimani.I saw; him in
the night of 24/25 April 45 near tne bunker of the executions. He stood
quite near ba me.Some corpses v’ere lying loaded on a trailer.I with a
squad of abotu lo men was carrying che corpses.On the trailer there was
a man's body.The man still heavily breathed.Then Dreimann saw; that,he
asked to be given a spade. With that spade he hit the man's head an his
scull broke into two parts,so that the brain flew out and besprinkled
the other bodies. When asking for the sp ade ,Dreimann said : "'That, that
bloody Russian pig still lives",-then he hit bim.-
DREIMAM then says :I recognize the vitnes TIMCEMO,but I can not remem-

ij 'gation on 6 -Sep 45.
I -was sentry in Dach.au KL from 1935 to 194o, later on in Grossrosen neam
Breslau.From 1943 to 1944 i was sentry in Lublin. LI April 1944 I came to
ileuegamme KL as Obersturmfilhrer.-I correct myself insofar,-that I ms com-
missioned as officer in 194o.-Ia Keuegamme KL I was appointed as chief of
the ochutzhaft (custody-prison) .‘The whipping of camp inmated £sck ms carri-
ed out by BG men.In my time about 6o to 7o persons were whipped .Out of
this number about 3° persons I have vhipp'ed personally .-About 12o persons
were executed in the camp.Out of that number 3o persons vwre sent to us
from Hamburg in order to be executed.The executions were carried out by
camp inmates,always three of them,every time by others.They were appoint-
ed by Dreimann,vho is being detained in this camp now.-They got for their
work 5 to lo cigarettes.There ms a brothels in the camp,I ms in charge
of it.There were about lo women in it, all Germans, the inmates had to pay
1 mark.-I add that besides the 12o persons executed as above, there were
brought 58 more for that purpose to the camp.They were sent to us by the
Hohere 83 und Polizeiinspektor from Hamburg and were executed in the camp.
Interrogation on 9	4-5.
In Heuegamme I ms in charge of the camp,but under the orders of PAULI.
It is. correct,that in the night from 24 to 25 April 1945 there were exe-
cuted 58 persons in our camp.They were sent to us by Hamburg Gestapo.Pauly
ordered me to execute them.He got the order from Police Fiihrer from Hamburg,
Graf Bassewitz-Behr.I never was given a written death warrant.-At about
23 hrs on 24 Apr 45 the .execution ms started. First 12 women were hanged.
That was done by camp inmates,their names being :Korne 1 ius,Siebers and
Lerns. Kornelius is being detained in the camp "B", he re .-After that I want-
ed to hurry up the work and I intended faaxxkHxk the nest to be shot. When
I entered cell door I was attacked by a Russian,who hit me in my face so
that iiy lip and ay chin ware injured.I nearly fainted.The Russian equally
attacked an SB man of the name Brems and that one shot him dead.Thereupon
I threw' 2 hand grenades into the cell and 6 men were killed.I entered the
cell and if somebody was not dead,I finished him off,from my automatic pis-
tol.That same evening I shot equally one woman, who se nationality is in known
to me.Hext day the execution of the next group of about v 3o persons was start
ed at 21 or22 hrs.They equally were brought from Hamburg Gestapo.I shot all
of them personally.! aid it myself as I did not want to burden the conscien-
ce of my subordinate s.On both days the following persons were present at
the execution :SS guards Feueramt ,Spe ck,jBrems and Huge. The last tw/o are here
in the camp.-I hurried the execution,as the eneay was at a distance of only
6 km and I had the order of S3 Reichfiihrer that they must not fall into the
enemy-1 s hands.-
Lvidence . abstract. of TIMCEMO VIADIMIR, age 27,fugoslav lieutenant,.! Camp
inmate of Heuegamme.He was a PoW in Osnabriick Of 1 ag VIC,delivered to the
Gestapo and' brought to Ueuegamme in March 1945,wehere he remained until
29 Apr 45♦ He states :
The hanging of prisoners in deuegamme camp generally was cariied out at
night,she shooting about noon. Beating of prisoners was quite normal.The
worst .of all members of the staff was ochutzhaf tffihrer (i. e. Thumann) .There
w^ere camp inmates in the camp who were marked as "Torsperie".That meant
that they ware sentenced to death.-In the night 24/25 Apr 45 I with 9 other
camp inmates wstss called to tne bunker,were people used to be killed. We
nad to enter the bunker,wreher we saw 6 naked women hanging. We had to take
them from the nooses and to carry them out and load them on a trailer.Then
we drove them to the crematorium.When we came back,6 new' women were hang-
ing. That was repeated 3 times, only the last time there wore men,not women
hanging.Then wa were ordered to enter one other department od the bunker.
Smiling and screeming was heard from within.At that mpneat 5 or 6 S3 guards
came out with automatic guns and truncheons.Thumann equally came out just
replacing nis pistol,that still was smoking,into its bag.On his face he
had a plaster.We heard f om the SS man that a Russian had attacked him.A﻿-2-

neoplel were not yet quite dead,I remember one Russian,who still was breath-
ing very deeply .Die imann stood close by.When he saw that the man sti-1!
was alive,he took a spade,hit him into the head so that the sehull was
split into two and the brain flew out. THTTMAMK went in and out,he looked
absolutely calm.During all that time we di stint cl 'heard the men laugh-
ing and chaffing,although a general confusion was reigning.-
I could recognize Thumann and D®eimann if they were shown, to me.
Confuontation.

iixamination on 9 Jul 4-5
I came to Langenhorn on 15 Mar 45 and I was in charge of the camp.There
were women only in tine camp.About 3° of them were fugoslavs.lt is true
that I beat these women,-! slapped their faces and beat then with a
truncheon,-but that was only because I did not vant to report them,as
they would have been severely punished.I remember once having beaten
a woman untilx she broke down.I do not know of what nationality she
was.-Ms. deputy ms Oberscharfuhrer Scharnows^c.My rank ms Unterschar-
fuhrer, still he was my deputy, as I ms bet oer trained for that kind _ of
?ork.-My chiefs were Hauptsturmfiihrer Weber and later on Obersturmfuhrer
Strippel.-They were in charge of 7 camps,among them Langenhorn.
Interrogation on 22 3U1 4-5»
I never was a party member,! was forced fro the Wehrmacht into the S3,
by Obersturmbannfuhrer Pauly.-In iNeuegamme Pauly was Lagerkommandant,
Thumann was Lag erfiihrer .They decided about everything in the camp. I only
was a sentry in the camp,I never entered tne camp and do not know what
was going on in the camp.I heard that camp inmates ofte i i-ere hanged
when they stole, out I never saw anything myself.-On 15 Mar 45 I mi-S trans
ferred to Langenhorn camp and w/as in charge oi it.There were about 5oo
wemen in the camp,all of them Jewess'.In April 1945 they were transferred
to Belsen and other women came to my camp. I remember 3o Yugoslav women
among them.They came from Helmstedt and were physically in a very bad
state,exhausted,ill etc.I treated them very veil,never ill-treated any-
body. The food was mxx good. I never had the right of punishing them and
I did not do it. Yes,maybe I sometimes hit one or an other, but never with
a tranche on. The re never wore any complaints brought to me by the inter-
neees about the food or their being ill-treated by the "capos".I anyway
had to keep up order in the camp.The women were starved aid they never
could await their food so tney rushed to the food kettles and I had to
keep them in order.-I can not remember the case brought agpiast me by
Milanovie Stojanka and Markovic Mi leva.
Interrogation on 6 Sep 45
The food in the camp was good. It was deliverea to us by the firm Ketten-
werke in Langenhorn,tne kitchen chief in that firm was Hoch from Lan-
genhorn, Ochsenzollen station.-The camp kitehen chief w/as Frau Schmidt
from Tiottbeek (Goiffss or Klein Flottbeck) .Her adaress is known to Vilma
UnmuthjWho v-orked in my of ice and is being detained in this camp novr.-
The camp life depended on the "capos",elected by the wnmen themself
(sic!). Before me Hauptscharfiihrer Lau (FuMsputtel near Hamburg)was in
charge of Langenhorn camp,and before his coming it was Hauptscharfuhrer
Hemingsen,now here in the camp,block "L".
A transport of 5oo Jewess’was escorted to Belsen in Apxi 1 45 ty a police-
man Jaeger,formerly customs agent or assistent from Hamburg.﻿- i

Sir,	/ , . _	//
On. the 30th. L.ay 1945, l/Opl. S'ergusson of Wo. 3 Royal Marine-
Provost Oorapany, reported to- me that whilst on duty in Hamburg
previously the same date, he had been approached- hy four civilian
'girl's who had'told him that they were ’Displaced Persons' and that
they had just seen the late Oommandant of their Gamp go 'into.the
Deutsche Bank, dressed in civilian clothes.	This man they
alleged "Rad been very cruel and had committed'offences against them
and was -also a member of the S.8. He took the girls to the bank
and there arrested the man' pointed out to him by them. ' He then
brought the man and the four girls to this office for further
enquiries to made in the matter.
I interviewed the four girls, and obtained statements from
them regarding the matter. Prom these statements,, copies att,
it will be seen that they definately identify the man as the
commandant of the Gamp Langenhorn, Hamburg, and also prove instances
of brutality which were personallygcarried out by himu
These girls are Yugo-Slavs and are at present at Bppendorfer
Kraifcenhaus, Hanburg, awaiting their return to Yugoslavia^-
The man, Rudolf .HXHTZE, of Plashofstrepp, Hauptstrast,
Biankenese, was then questioned. He admitted being the
Commandant, of The LangenJjom-Co&qentri^ipn. 0amp for Jewess’, but
-denied that .Ee'w^aSrSS"’STs. Officer dr” that lie had iitre'atBd any
of' the prisoners. Hfi.....aa,a-latgr placed Jni ’ cloee-:ar.rest,’ at,.ji
Ho* 34. Oivil'Police Station.- Hamburg. -	;	/(
inquiries made-at the Deutsche Bank, Hamburg, revealed that
Hintze was employed there as messenger both prior to the war and
after, on asking about his antecedents, I was shown a pro. forma,
set of-questions in accordance vdth Law Ho. 3 of the Military
Government Pinanee.Department, which had been completed by Hintze.
This showed in hid own- handwriting that he was a member of the
Armoured S. S. with the eqMvilant rank of Petty Officer. I ■
obtained a photostactic copy of this document for pi’oduction if
required.

On the 20th. July lp44, I was arrested hy the
•j-ernans 'because i worked for the National Movement in Yugoslavia
against the occupators and was brought to a concentration camp
for women at Havensbruck,	There the Germans cut off all ray
hair and took away from me all my belongings. Prom Havensbruck
I was taken to Bendorf where I worked in a factory making V. is.
From Bendorf about 5,000 people. Displaced persons,
and I were taken with about 2,000 women to the Concentration Camp
Langenhom, where the Commandant was the man I saw in Hamburg in
civilian dress.
When we came to this camp after a journey of 12 days
we were hungry, thirsty and exhausted, for five days we did not
receive any food, so that we could hardly stand. Many of us fainted.
This S.S. man awaited us at the station and brought us to the camp.
On arrival he ordered us stand in rows like soldiers, but beaause
moBZ or us were so exhausted that we could not do this this as fast
as he wished he started to beat pitilessly all who did not obey
his orders. Afterwards he sent us to the Barracks. Two
hours later we received our first meal which was hot water with
some leaves of foul vegetables in it. Then after another hour
we received one loaf of bread between 12 persons.
After a rest of one day he came to the barracks
about 4.0. a.rn. and ordered us to get out as quickly as possible for
roll call. As the door was only very small we could, only get
out one by one, he therefore became very cross and we became so
frightened that some of the girls jumped out of the windows.
When we were all stood in rows he sent all the German girls back
to the barracks, then he asked the German women who wane in charge
of the camp, who had protested against the food being bad and
insufficient.	She pointed out two Hungarian girls (gypsies;
although there were more* of us who had protested.	He took
them in front of us and beat them until he got so tired that he
could not lift his hand.	The girls fainted and blood came
from their mouths and noses. He did not give them anything to
eat or drink for two days afterwards.
It was my luck that I stayed there only 15 days
otherwise the Commandant who was such a rude man and Brigand that
I do not think I should have been alive to-day.

In the nl^ht to 24. April 1945 21 mn rind 13 worsen, who had been

cent to the concentration canp HQuengaans by the Oeotapo-Leitotelle

seharfUhrer BreIoann and other SS-oen, assisted by the crininal
prisoners TJvc Sleversen, Ossy tJnverdoon and Bail Cornelius.
The last aentioned, occu led in the camp as cleaning-capo (foreman)
was ordered in that night to transport the hanged rind shot men and
women. In the course of this execution Ober .-turnfahrer Thuoann was
hurt- In his face by a Russian officer'(prisoner) viho offered re-
sistance „ In the resulting shooting the prisoner Cornelius told	f
other 'prisoners- whose names are enumerated below that he had been
engaged In the execution and;that he had thrown handgrenades into
the bunker. These other prisonsrs are: -jbssf Kindler# age* 29.1.1o
living in Hamburg, Thorniuiststr. 44, the Polish prisoner !v;uld
Gondaik, age: 14.12.19, born at Bomb, living in Hamburg (address can
be obtained by Exipostelle Hamburg, Brehbahn 36) and Ernst Saal- d
ouchter, age; 18,0.97 born at ITeuss, living in Haaburg-Ste 11 ingen.
These can affirm that Cornelius toasted to Ixive taken part in the
executions. He also took for himself several clothes of the murdered,
I was Informed about the above by numerous prisoners in the concen-
tration camp ITeuengamme in the morning of 24. April 45. X was
occupied as a camp clerk in the camp Reuengamne. I was at Heuengamms
from 24. ITov/^pbjQr 1944 to the break-up of the camp. Beforehand I had
been for 7 1 /2V’in the concentration camp Dachau.
Cornelius is liable to prosecution because he, being a prisoner,, vo-
luntarily agreed to take part in the execution. He needed not throw
hand-grenades. Therefore he is to be reckoned among the war criminals.
Uv,e Sieversen who also took part In the execution has been arrested
by the British Military Police. The other persons who" were engaged
are still being searched for.

Being asked to come, the workman Emil Cornelius,
age 3.3.0&, born at Tilsit, East Prussia, appears in the office-
room of the Biirgermeister at Edendorf and, being warned to tell
the truth, states the following:
I liY© at Edendorf at the carrier's Peter Horstmann. From 10 Oct.
1956 I was in the concentration camp Sachsenhausen near Berlin.
On 12 Dec. 1958 I was sent to the concentration camp Hamburg-
Eeuengamme.
Last I was foreman in the camp heuengamme. It is true, that in
the night to 24 April 1945 about 21 men and 13 women were hanged
and shot . In the same night I was ordered by the leader of the
camp Thumann to transport the dead bodies to the crematory. I did
so.
uestion: Were you engaged in the shooting and hanging of the
prisoners ?
Answer: ho I never received such orders by the leader of the camp.
I must admit, as already mentioned, that I transported the
corpses by order of Thumann.
But I must reject the accusation, that I threw handgrenades into
the bunker. I know, that hand-grenades were thrown into the bunker,
but I only watched it at a distance of 30 m. The person throwing
the hand-grenades was a Blockfiihrer of strong stature. I do not
know his name.
question: Did you appropriate clothes of the hanged or shot persons
to yourself ?
Answer: Do the corpses wei’e naked when I transported them. The
clothes were taken to the clothing depot before the
execution.
I have told the whole truth.

In the whole Camp he had a bad name, because he illtreated
his workers with a stick in a most cruel way. Consequently almost
daily several prisoners had to run the gauntlet of SS Guards because
they were unfit to work. This practice usually ended with the
prisoners concerned being shot.
Later on Cornelius was transferred as Capo to the Aussenkommando
Wittenberge where he was also wellknown for his brutality. After he
fell ill in Wittenberge he was returned to Meuengamme and later again
became Capo.
Concerning the execution of 72 civilians at the end of April
1945, Come litis took an active part in the incident. On the morning
following the execution of the first half of the party, I heard in
the Camp that Cornelius armed with hand grenades tried to distinguish
himself to the S3 men present by taking an active part in the killing.
Cornelius is said to have thrown grenades into the cells of the bunker.
On the first night I did not see anything personally, but on the
n
following morning the events were described to me by various other
prisoners.
In the punishment block 20 there were 13 women, amongst them
were two rassians and at least 1 Polish woman, and about twenty men,
they were brought in groups of 10 under strong escort to the bunker
where they were executed. Some of the men offered resistance so the
SS men headed by SS Obersturmfuhrer Thuhmann and SS Undersoherfuhrer
Dreimann shot Into the ventilators of the cells, on that occasion
one of the prisoners, with some courage, knocked the pistol out of *
hand of Larger Fuhrer Thuhmann and the pistol fell into the cell,-﻿After that Thuhmann armed all the SS men present and the four
■^prisoners Cornelius,Leers,Siewersen,Unverdonn with hand grenades and
oi?P^^d them to throw them into the cells. After a considerable
time there was no signs of life to be detected in the cells, the
four aforementioned prisoners opened the doors and removed the bodies.
The SS men and the four prisoners taking part went to an adjoining
bathhouse where baths had been prepared for them, there they discussed
the execution and boasted about their deeds. The prisoner, Josef
Handler, who was employed in the bathhouse heard their conversation.
I was told with certainty that Cornelius had thrown several grenades
during the execution.

I, Herbert Schemmel born 14 April 1914 in Halle,
Occupy! i-clerk residing at Hamburg Alsterdorf 39 Eloat 20, having been
duly 'swoxn state
Willy Leers is about 40 years of age, height 1.67metres strong
and stout build, he comes from Koln Rhineland, he speaks with a typical
Kbln dialect. During his arrest at the committee of ex-political
prisoners, which I csmsed when he appeared in Hamburg, he wore a brown
leather jacket which belonged to one of the murdered persons.
leers was a professional criminal wearing green triangle on
his suit he was a prisoner in the concentration camp at Neuengamme.After
he finished his sentence in Moorlagar where he was known and feared as
violent and brutal especially when it was learnt thet he killed one of
his fellow'prisoners during a dispute, this fact he mentioned several
times in conversation when I was present however he described this fact of
murder as an unhappy accident. Nearly all prisoners kept out of his way
as he always professed to be right, and differences of opinion usually
led to a fight in which he beat his adversary to the ground without mercy.
Leers soon became Capo in Neuengamme and he had a good name
with the 3.3. owing to his methods of dealing with people at work.
During a job of concreting the parade ground and during the erection of
the potatoe cellars he chased the prisoners under him with threats and
beatings towards their extreme working capacity, because of this he was
rewarded several times by the 3.S.
Later Leers was transferred tn the Aussen Kommando Osnabruck as
a first class Capo here he could do absolutely everything he wanted as
the Kommandofuhrere' S.S. Hauptscherfuhrer Brinkmann gave him full
authority to do so. Leers took valuable rings, watches and other jewelry
in great quatities from the prisoners under his command. Soon Osnabruck
became too hot for Leers so he escaped on a motor cycle, but was arrested
a month later in the Rhineland. On his return to Neuengamme he was not
put into a punishment company as they usually did with other fugitives
but was reinstated again as Capo in the Kommando Hammerwerk. This is a sign
of how high his methods had been estimated by the S.S. As Capo of the
Kommando Hammerwerk, Leers again got xxxtg&kgx considerable amounts of
valuables, he handed these over to Rep^ftfuhrer Dreimann for the purpose
of getting permission to visit the special barrack room or better known
as the brothel. During the execution of the 72 civilians Leers personally
threw grenades through the gaps into the "bunker',' Leers took an active
part on both nights. On- the second night, together with the forementioned
three prisoners Cornelius, Siewersen and Unverdomm he helped in the
hanging^ of the victims with ropes.
I know that Leers frequently requested to become a member
of the S.S. Special formation Bx±3cxse Dirlewanger and he was finally
accepted in April 1945.

I, Reginald Pringle having been duly sworn, certify that I
have correctly translated the above statement by Herbert Schemmel.

in charge of food distribution there he enjoyed many liberties. On one
occasion he escaped but after a short time he was arrested again and
brought back to Neuengamme there he was turned over for six months to a
punishment company. Following that he again become Capo of a working
party and he repeatedly applied to the Lagarfuhrer Thuhmann to he
included in the S.S. Special Formation Dirlewanger and m April 1945 he
was accepted.	, . ,	^	.
Siewersen was seen putting stick grenades into his

I, Herbert Schemmel born 14 April 1914 in Halle, Occupation -

sworn, state:-
Unverdomm is about 38 years of age strongly built comes
, fmm Sudeten district the German speaking part on the Czechoslovak
border, nickname Ossy.Unverdomm was a criminal prisoner he came from the
concentration camp Sachseiihausen to'NeuengammewiKthe begining of 1944.
In the middle of 1944 he became Bloekleader of the block 27 in
Heuengamme.	'
During the executions which oJKmX&d occurred on an average once
or twice a week he was nearly'always called because he had had experience)
in the job of hanging. Unverdomm was an active participater in the
execution of the 72, civilians. On the first night he was in posession of
grenades he also assisted in the clearing of the "bunker" cells and the
removal of the dead. On the second night he together with the other
three prisoners performed the job o# hanging the remaining civilians
in the "bunker".After our liberation from the camp Unverdomm lived in the
former S.S. settlement Langenhorn.
When I tried at the end of May this year^ to bring about
his arrest,he escaped through the back window of his house and since
that time he has not been seen in Hamburg.
• I was an eye witness on the second night when the civilian^
stkK were brought from block20 to the "bunker" in groups of ten.
The four prisoners Cornelius, leers, Siewersen and Unverdomm were the
only ones exept the S.S. who had acces to the "bunker", the whole
ground surrounding the "bunker" was cordoned ofi by S.S. men. Corpses
were brought in carts to the crematorium on the same night and burned
there.
I was a political prisoner from 13 /9 / 39 till 3/5/45
in Neuengamme I was for four and a half years camp clerk and I know of
the abovementioned happenings from my own experiance , except the first
night of the execution.

I, Hans Karl Schwarz, of
WinterhWfe. Having been duly sworn state.
I got an order from Obersturmfuhrer Thuhmann to fetch the
prisoners Ossy Unverdomm, Emil Cornelius, Uv/e Siewersen and leers, this
order was given on the night of the 22/23 April 1945 at 22.30 hgurs, I
sent a clerk to fetch these four men. In a shelter were
Obersturmfuhs?es? Thuhmann, a clerk, Dreimann and two or three other S.S.
men all heavily armed with automatic guns and hand-grenades. The four
men who I had called, arrived and were sent to the shelter where they
started the execution. At twono'clock in the morning I called the bath-
cleaner Josef Handler to prepare baths for the S.S. men. I then saw the
four prisoners taking clothes off the murdered prisoners, and talking
about their experiences during the execution. They seemed very proud of
having finished off the peopls who w$re still alive after the execution
with pistols given to them by the S.S. men, they also said that the S.S.
men were very scared. The prisoner leers had a leather vest v^hich
belonged to one of the murdered persons.
Other witnesses of this incident were:-
Herbert Schemmel
Ernist Saaluachter
Ewald G-ondzik
Albin ludke
Josef Handler
and many other prisoners of the concentration camp Heuengamme.
Cornelius, leers and Unverdomm were boasting of the above facts to
other prisoners in the camp.
In the morning of the 23 April 1945 I heard a
conversation between Obersturmfuhrer Thuhmann and the clerk Dreimann in
the office of the Blockfuhrer, Thuhmann was telling how he^came to get
the wound on his cheek, " This pig hit me with his fist, if the others
didn't help me". I could not hear any more as I was sent out of the offi

.Having been duly sworn state.	_
I have been in Dachau and Heuengamine. During the night 0
the 2°/23 April 1945 I was called out by the Heportfuhrer Dreimann to
I, Josef Handler, of Marielouisenstrasse 132,
Having been duly sworn state.	.
I have been in Dachau and Neuengamme. During the_night 01
come to the"bath. The bath was in the immediate vicinity.of the
» Bunker" ( torture-cell). I saw that the thirteen viomen and ten men _
who were brought into the scamp on the 20 April 1945 had been muredered
there. The thirteen women had been hanged first and then they put the
ten men to death. The men could not be hanged, because they offered
resistance. Lagerfuhrer ( camp leader) Thuhmann tried to shoot them, but
he did not succeed because one man tore off a board and hit him on the
hand. After that all/ kag Blocfefuhrers went away to procure hand-
grenades which Lagerfuhrer Thuhmahn threw”' into every individual cell.
The detonations could be heard in the whole camp.
Hour professional criminal prisoners:-
TLLlly Leers
Uwe Siewersen
Bmil Cornelius
Ossy Unverdomm	,	,. , ..
gave a hand in the hanging of the thirteen women, they actually did^the
hanging themselves. The four professional criminals also took part^in
the^killing of the men, as far as to load the corpses and pieces of their
bodies onto a cart. The clothes and other valuable articles had been
removed from the dead. Owing to the throwing of hana—grenades into the
cells not only the bodies of the prisoners had been torn into parts, but
also the cells were half demolished and had to be repaired by the brick-^
layer on the following day.	, , n ^	■
On the night of the 23/24 I was fetched to the
Hvery time ten men were brought by. the prisoner Willy Leers, wh0 lit'# co^m.—
shot^by the Lagerfuhrer individualy in the eells. The four aforementioned
prisoners again had to perform the task, of pulling the corpses out of the
cells and stacking them on the cart. On that occasion they took all the
clothes and other useful belongingsoff the dead. Still to-day ..'illy Leers
is in posession of s leather wallet which belonged to one of the victims.
After these killings they all assembled in the bath and
boasted and praised each other for their deeds. They were also completely
splashed with human blood. In the bath Willy Leers busied himself
searching the clothes and packages of the dead.
About these killings Ernst Saalwachter, Herbert Schemmel,
Ewald Gondzik, Albin Ludke, can also give evidence as witnesses.
I, Reginald Pringle having been duly sworn, certify that I have
correctly translated the above statement by Josef Handler.

Personal description of Emil Cornelius* Height loO to
165 cm. Pace, oval, protruding ears, thick lips broad shoulders, rather
stout, blonde hair.	, 1	„
I can remember Cornelius as foreman m the clearing
station, I was at that time employed in the office of the camp. Under
his command there were mainly sick prisoners,they were working at
levelling the ground. The name Cornelius became well known to me as there
were numerous prisoners reporting t-i me in the office about him
maltreating and striking them, he also encouraged the Blockfuhrers
against the prisoners.
In the middle of 1943 he went to the Aussenkommando
Wittenberge,thea?ehe behaved in the same way, the repatriated prisoners
there told me that he killed a Pole. He received favours from the S.S.
owing to the way he treated these prisoners. When he returned from the
Aussenkommando Wittenberge, he received a good hiding from the other _
ppj_. However, he was put	into a poso as Capo (supervisor,
of work,therefore he never had to perform any sort of manual labour.
1 personally did not see Cornelius during the execution
on the night of the 23/24 April 1945. Other comrades of mine told me
that he had not been seen in the hut during that time untilm the
following morning. During those two days he slept a longer period than
we did and pretended to be ill.

%
1.	This is a case of continuous maltreatment of the internees at
NEUGRABEN Concentration Camp which was an Aussenkommando of NEUENGAMME.
The Camp at NEUG-EABM was moved in Peh 45 to TIEPSTACK near HAIvIBURG, but
the same personnel, both guards and victims, are involved,
2.	The incidents at NEUGRABEN have been made the subject of special
investigation. Although it was apparent that the accused could be dealt
with individually as"NEUENGAMME Minors", from the investigation point of
view it was easier to treat the case as an entity and to report on it on
those lines. Accordingly, the case is submitted to you as a separate
case - NEUGRABEN/TIEPSTACK AUSSENEQMliANDO case.
3.	The evidence has been prepared so as to support a general charge
against any or all of the accused in respect of the conditions in the
camps and/or particular charges against individual accused for spe^’^ic
acts of crueljjy. Proformas of Submission have been prepared for each
of the accused, although you may decide that the following accused:-
Max Paul JAHN
Ernst Earl PETERSEN
Gerhard SPANJAR
Bernhard Rudolf Paul SCHUBERT
Erna GOEDICKB
could be left to be dealt with as EZ camp guards under the NUREMBERG
Tribunal decision on this category when these are made known.

Proformas of Submission. The second cojoy has been sent to the Czechoslova
kian War Crimes Liaison Group at this HQ, that in view of the fact that of
the 500 women internees more than 450 were Czechs.

1.	The above named was arrested on the 2oth beptemoer^
194-5 on the grounds that he had been a member of the
camp guards at HEI'SRABffl and TISPSTAK camps. He is
interned at Ho. 1 wrvilian Internment Gamp.
2.	As a result of investigations regarding the .above
two camps a recommendation for the relea.se 01 ohis
man was forwarded to you on 15th March 194-6.
3. Recent enquiries show that he is, however, stall
interned at ITSiilUifTSTSR. It is believed that ne
can give valuable evidence against Hauptschuriueh"1
rer Friedrich KLIM, the commandant of HEUGRABM
and TIHF3TAK and tills was the main reason for the
request for ills release.
4.. Q-.S.I. (B.) have infortaed me that in answer to a
request from A. (P.S.) 4- they forwarded to Amt
branch a personal file of Otto KA2HL ’E nuiaberea
127/10952, on 13th April. This was apparently an
connection with enquiries regarding the release of
KAEHLER. This file has not yet been returned to
Cr.S.I. (B.)
5. Could you therefore please arrange for the re-
lease of Otto KAEHLER forthwith, as it is_con-
sidered that he will be more willing to give a
detailed statement when free than he would as a
prisoner.

To
Public Prosecuter
of the Trial liefstack-Neugraben
with reqest for submitting to
the competent British Authority
July 2nd,
1946
V:.
-^ear Sirs,
The trial Tiefstack-Neugraben now drawing to a close respectively !
having come already to an end when you have got this letter, I
politely beg once mor for immediate release of my fiance Jerhard
Spanjer from internment-camp Neamunster, cage 1.
On November 8th, 1945 Mr. Spanjer has been arrested at the finance-
office (Finanzprasidium) Rodingsmarkt in Hamburg by British officials
and has been brought to Neumunster
I presented immediately a petition to the investigation court,
adding affidavits of three political ex-prisoners who made them-
selves answerable for Mr. Spanjer. Also the committee of political
ex-prisoners Maria Louisenstrafie, Hamburg, stood up for Mr.Spanker'
release in spring of this year.
fox*
Mr. Spanker was only about 6 weeks (March/April 1945) at Tiefstack,
and there he has done his best to relieve somewhat the hard fate
of the prisoners.
In his capacity as an employee of custom-service Mr. Spanjer was
ordered off compulsorily by his authority and was pressed'watching
.	p.t.o.﻿tiie concentration camp. He did not belong to HSD4P or one ox its
formations, but he was an opponent of the party. The public
prosecutor of the trial Tiefstack-Neugraben was so kind al^fco in-
form me by the solicitor Dr. lappenberg of Mr. Spanker's having
not been accused, further I was told that his release was already
applied for.
The room in which Mr. Spanjer lived until having been arrested,
has been seized now by dwelling-office (Wohnungsamt) Fuhlsbiittel.
Wanting to keep the room for Mr. Spanjer I have attained that the
room will not be let preluminarily. But the respite being granted
for a short time only,I also beg for this reason for quickest re-
lease .
Mr. Spanjer having been imprisoned innocently in the internment
camp leumunster for 8 months, I appeal to our humanity and hope
for benevolent grant of my petition.
Your respectfully﻿A (PS.4)

1.	Would you please arrange for the i,-.mediate release
of tho "a/n who arc interned in No. 1 GIG, MSUMUENSIER and
against whoa there is no evidence to Justify a charge of
committing a war crime.
2.	XABHLER Otto. GSI (3) forwarded personal file of
Otto KAEHLER, No. 527/10952 to your branch on 13 Apr 46 in
connection with enquiries regarding his release. KAEHLER
was arrested on the 26 Sep 4p because he was a member of
the camp guards of NEUGRABEN/TIEFSTAK, Lt. Col. LEICESTER-
WARREN spoke to Lt. Co}.. HARHIE on 3 Jun 46 asking for his
immediate release, but KAEHLER is still in arrest, having
now been incarcerated for nearly 9 months although no crime
has been alleged against him. Furthermore it is cleaf from
statements made by all the Czechoslovakian witnesses who
appeared at the above trial that this man, far from being
a criminal never in fact coiamitted any act of ill treatment
whatever but gave the concentration camp prisoners every
assistance of -which he was capable. Incidentally he appeared
as a valuable witness for the prosecution against the Com-
mandant of the camp. In view of KAEHLER * s complete innocence
of any offence and his long imprisonment it would be apprec-
iated if his release .carHrd be regarded as a matter for urgent
attention,
3.	SPAMAR Gerhurd. A letter has been received from
Erna OilRE, the fiance of this man, who has also been in
arrest for a long period requesting that h£!F solicitor may
be informed when he is released,** That his dwelling house
is in danger of being seized by the German Accommodation
authorities unless he is freed within the next few days.
Would you therefore please arrange for the German solicitor
Dr. LAPPSfBERG of HAIBURG (telephone HASSBURG 336797) to
be informed of the date when SPANJAR will be released. Dr,
LAPPENBERG is known to Capt, MeMEILL, ‘A’ Branch, HA-BURG,-

Ejco^jt in the case of KLEM it uaa only very occasion.',W that the
witnesses were able to give evidence of having been persaoally beaten or injured by
the ficcucod and the saiae four witnesses appeared in most of the oases in varying prCT*-
portions. It would Ixave been desirable to have had more witnesses who had received
personal injury from the particular accused.
6. ’HW^LOfiT
The transport situation was i-nst unsatisfactory. A maetin" with the
witnesses had been arranged by the Prosecutor f r the day before the trialj but out
of 5 dinessos* only one appeared at the appointed place, two hours after the txme he
was supposed to be there. mis was no dohbt due to the fact that it was a Saturday
afternoon and the witnesses were not easily available at the short notice given to
them. However* if there had been a oar available for the Prosecutor* he would have
been able to see most of these persons* but he was unable to obtain any form of
transport from any source on that day* Thus he was compelled to enter the Court on
•fSgi o without having met any of hi- vrioiiooues. 0. ih to the fact tn':t transport
mas in great demand from personnel in ih ilamburg District^ it was exceedingly
difficult for the Prosecutor to obtain a oar even to tafee him to Court, although it
was clear that the convening authority did make every effort to supply a vehicle
when they could, but they were oversiialiaea by the very oenaid® able demand made noon
mem from other quarters. During the course of the trial the Prosecutor wiabed to
interview some of the witnesses and also seme new witnesses viio were obtained at a
late stage in the proceedings. It wwb, however, impossible to contact these persons
at the appropriate'time owing to the fact that no vehicle of any kind could be
obtained.

8. WITNESSES	.	.
-----	Except in the case of KLIEM it was only very occasionally that the
witnesses were able to give evidence of having been personally beaten or injured by _
the accused and the same four witnesses appeared in most of ^the cases in varying_
portions. It would have been desirable to have had more witnesses who had received
oersonal injury from the particular accused.
6. TRANSPORT
The transport situation was most unsatisfactory. A meeting with the
witnesses had been arranged by the Prosecutor for the day before the
of 9 witnesses, only one appeared at the appointed place, -two noureafter the time he
was supposed to be there. This was no doubt due to the fact that it was a_Saturday
afternoon and the witnesses were not easily available at the short notice given
them. However, if there had been a car available for the irosecutor, he woul^ ha
been able to see most of these persons, but he ms	to obtain any	on
transport from any source on that day. Thus he was compelled to enter	J
HbSSlay without having met any of his witnesses. Owing to the fact that trans^
was in great demand from personnel in HQ Hamburg District, it ms exceedingly
difficult for the Prosecutor to obtain a car even to take him to court,	.
was~ clear that the convening authority did make every effort to supply a vehicle
when they could, but they were overwhelmed by the very considerable demand made upon
tZ from other quarters. During the course of the trial the Prosecutor wished to
interview some of the witnesses and also some new witnesses who were obtained at a
SHiSe	“£.e,lings. It ms, h»ev.r, tepossitle to contact these persons
at the appropriate^ time o»ing to the fact that no vehicle of any hind eouLd he
obtained.

1.	Ref. your letter BA0R/15228/11/5/JAG, of the
8th inst. re. the above named internee at No. 1
C.I.C. Neumunster.
2.	This prisoner was arrested on the 26:9*45, on
the grounds that he had been a member of the camp
guard at NEUGRABEN/TIEFSTAK Aussenkommandos. He
was one of 25 Customs Officials who were drafted
for Concentration Camp duties at Neugraben in Sept.
1944.
3.	In November 1945 a preliminary investigation was
carried out by Capt. J.Alexander (JAG Staff Pool) at
that time attached to H!Q. 8 Corps District, and on
his advice a reccommendation for the release of the
above named was forwarded to your office. ( Covering
letter to file "Neugraben & Tiefstak, No. $37* dated
13th Nov. '45 refers.)
4.	I am now conducting a more complete investigation
regarding the above camps, and all witnesses I have
interrogated state that this man was never in any
sense a 'War Criminal', he has often, with great risk
to himself, helped many prisoners by obtaining for them
extra food, and bearing messages to and from the camp.
On one occasion he was himself arrested and imprisoned
by the SS for giving food to one of the women.
5w» I am now of the opinion that he will serve as a
most valuable witness against other members of the
camp staff, and request the	; he be imme-
diately released.	|

DEPOSITION

Eva . D _o_n__a__t
Deposition on oath of Eva Donat, female, of Sternberg, Smetamova 6,
Czechoslovakia, sworn before Honald Balter Rose, Capt. Essex Regiment of
No.2 Har Grimes Investigation Team, at Hamburg, on pebruary 19, 1946.
I am 22 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at Clomouc,
Czechoslovakia. My permanent home is. at Sternberg, Smatamova 6, I am '
at present living at Stale, Schaferstleg 15.
Between September 15, and 20, 1944 I was one of 500 women prisoners, who
'were moved from Dessauer Ufer concentration camp; to Neugraben Palkenberg
Camp. All, but 16 of these women were Czechoslovakian, except 15 Germans
and one Pole. We were arrested and interned because we were jews. There
viere also 3 Dutch girls.
At Neugraben the prisoners lived in two large^wooden huts^^Jjach hut
was divided into two blocks. Each block was divided up rPHBgnall rooms,
and when we first arrived there were 10 single beds in eaSffroom. Brfore
our arrival it had been an Italian P.o.W. Camp, and the Italians assisted
us in moving into the camp bdfore they left until they were stopped doing
so by the Camp■ Kommandant. l/here 10 Italians were billettad about 25
women were billatted and slept on double bunks. In each room there were
12 chairs and one small table at which we ate our meals.
The bunks were made of wood and we slept on straw-mattresses with two
blankets per person. There’ were not always sufficient blankets for the
number of personnel in the camp, and the Camp Kommandant made no attempt to
obtain more.
The only clothes we wore were as .follows;- :Qne thin summer dress, one pair
of knickers, one pair1 of wooden shoes with cloth uppers, and for working
we had one pair of overalls, lie had no stockings or other Underwear. After
the, first month some more clothes were delivered to the camp, and we then had
a vest'in addition to the other clothes, the .underwear was made of blue
flannel with white stripes, although ft was winter and very cold we received
no further clothes until the end of November, and we were then issued with
coats and one pair of grey woollen stockings.
There was never sufficient clothing to issue each person with a complete set
and many of the prisoners were without coats, stockings etc. In some cases
the SS-women in the camp took away some of the better quality clothes for their
own use, and these articles were.never replaced. The names of 2 of the
SS-Aufseherinnen, v/ho were guilty of this were Anita Erank and Gertrude
Schulz.
The food was very poor. A normal day's-ration was as follows: Breakfast:
a very bad coffee, lunch: nothing, evening meal: a very thin and poor
quality soup usually made from rotten cabbage and turnips, and four thin
slices of bread per person with 2 gramms of margarine.
The food had to be fetched by the prisoners from the kitchen of a
Belgian and Erench camp about 500 metres away. It was carried in 5®
1 litre containers. Each container weight approximately 20 kilos. This
task was extremely difficult as the containers had to be carried up and
down a fairly steep hill and the camp Kommandant, Bauptscharfuhrer Kliasm,
Yi/ould not allow any person to give us assistance.
/ Afte
﻿lifter about two raontha at Neugraben the kitchen was installed inside
the camp itself, and after that time the food became even worse, owing
to the fact that Lkiem and others of the camp staff made a habit of
taking away parts of the prisoners rations for their won use and for their
families. In addition to Klieim, Joseph Hauanstein, the Proviantaeister, Anita
Prank, the KuchenaUfseherin, and Gertrude Schulz often stole the prisoners'
rations, after January 1945 we received no potatoes at all because they had
either been stolen by the camp staff or had gone bad in the store. Sometimes
after an air-raid we received horse flesh from bourses, which had been killed ,
during the raid. This meat had to be cleaned with the same brushes that
were used for cleaning the' floor in the camp.
Owing to the poor quality 'and insufficient food there was a large amount
of dysentry, because they then only received a white bread instead of the
black which was not nearly so filling and no soup. There were very few
medical supplies and Kliem, the Kommandant, was not concerned with the
welfare of the sick prisoners. Diseases and injuries which could normally
be cured in a few days took months to be cured merely through lack of
attention. Blood-poisoning was very common, and owing to the bad feeding the
prisoners had no power of resistance against diseases.
Sometimes the blankets were taken away ti be disinfected, and the prisoners
were sometinf^Jpjdthout blankets for 4 or 5 days. .Cold water had to be ^
used for washitig, and prisoners could only wash very early in toe morning
before they .went to work, or late at night after 09.00 hrs when it. was dark.
No lights were allowed after that time .and very often the water was turned
off at night time. We were never permitted to have a bath.
One of Kliem's methods of punishment whenever he' was displeased was to
lock the wash-house, so that nobody could wash at all.
1 ; >• /	.
Every day most of the .girls were taken: to,}i,;i.rb6itskommandos, where they were
employed on such tasks as cleaning away bomb debris, brick-making, builaing
■emergency houses, digging:draining systems, and felling trees approximate y
25 girls were employed within the camp itself, and usually there were about
25 in the revier. I myself was a Deputes Block Leader, therefore I cannot
give evidence- s/bout the ^irbeitsckouiniandos*
About the middle of February 1945 the whole camp was moved to Tiefstak, _
here we had the same Kommandant, Eriedrich Kliem, and the same camp guards,
at Teifstak there were 3 huts. The first one was the dining room an
included the provision store, kitchen and washroom. The second hut, known
as block I consisted of the revier, the clothing store, the laboratory,
the camp-senior 1s room,'the living accommodation for 95.prisoners. ine
third hut,.known asblock II, consisted of 6 rooms and in each room there
■ were about 52 or 54 people.
In this camp'we slept on double bunks, made of wood with straw mattresses
and only one blanket. Ss had .no possession than the clothes an which we
stood up. In the revier there were three rooms, each with 1^- beds (^double
bunks) and one room for the medical personnel. The laboratory was never
used.
There were two. air-raid shelters inside the camp. One, which held about
60 people and the other .one, which held about 40. Therefore* when there
was an airraid only 100 people could' fine shelter, and the	during
had to stay in the opem. We were not allowed- to remain msiae the hut. during
an air-raid, even though there v/as no shelter.
When we first'arrived at Tiefstak parts of the tats were, not even
finished and until they were completed many prisoners had to sleep in r ,
with incomplete walls and on the bare floor without beds. There was n
enough straw- for all persons to-sleep on. The water in the washroom
was not always turned on, and on these occasions we had to wash in the
river. Often when there was no water in the washroom, we had to do without
/a wash﻿‘ t
- 3 -
ST wash for several days,
coffee to wash.
I have even seen some of the prisoners using
For the greater part of the time at Teifstak the lavatory was without
walls or a roof and people using it were exposed to all weathers.
The food at Teifstak was worse than at Neugraben. Coffee was sometimes
made with water from the river, and the coup was very thin and watery
and usually was made from cabbage or turnips. Often there was no water,
and I have seen many oi the girls crying because they wpre so thirsty.
Drinking water for the camp had to be feteched^frorn a tap at least 500
metres away from the ca<ap„ It Was carried in 50 1 ooiitainers and was
very heavy. I have sg£n a guard names ftsderkopt preventing women from
drinking watef“i®S'K"“tirey were thirsty. He beat and shouted at them and
drove them away, threatening to shoot at them it they would come again,
Dysentry continued to be very common, owing to the poor feeding and the
revier was always full of sick people* There was only one doctor, who
was a prisoner hereself and she had 3 assistants. These people worked
Yi/ell, but received no assistance from any of the camp staff. Medical
supplies were poor. Svhen operations were necessary the camp doctor had
to use ordinary knives as there ware no surgical instruments available.
Kliam did all he could in order to prevent vmaen from- reporting sick.
Women were often made to go to work even though they were^tll.
There were no arrangements,for washing clothes,	and although we	were
allowed to Wash clothes, we were not allowed to	hang	them up to	dry.	Ws
a result of this and the fact that we had only one set of clothes, we often
had to wear wet clothing. The Camp Kommandant would allow nothing to
hang on the walls and nothing to be left on the	beds	during the	day.
Whenever he found any spare article of clothing	left	lying about on the
beds or in the cupboard-s- he confiscated them.-’ ’
During the whole time at these two camps we ware not allowed to send or’
receive letters or to have any contact'.with any people outside the camps,
liny-person guilty of .such an offence was most severely punished by
Kliem. His methods of punishment in the camps were beatiijg with his leather
belt or with a rubber tube which he obtained from the kitchen, and some-
times he would have all the hair shaved off a woman's head.

-Vf®

Vi
The chief methods of punishment were beatings v/ith a leather strip or
rubber tube, kicking, shaving a person's head, ^removing a part of a
person's clothing-(her coat etc.) and by extra Yiork. When a prisoner was
beaten, 25 strokes were the usual number, but often it was more depending
on how Kliem or his guards: felt.
I have seen many women being beaten by Kliem. One of those beaten by
him Y/as Gertrude Neumann. Kliem had discovered that a person outside the
camp via.s trying to smuggle some bread to Neumann and for this Gertrude
Neumann received 25 lashes with a rubber tube vihile all the other prisoners
were made to watch, .-.s a result of this beating- Gertrude Neumann was sick
for about 2^- months. She could not s-uand properly, her back and kidneys
Y«ere seriously damaged. On another accossion the guard Gustav Rosoly
reported a woman for stealing a turnip while vidth a working party and
Kliem himself beat this’ woman and the Vorarbeiterin with 25 lashes in
public, and for'this the Verarbeiterin lost her job.
Another girl named Erna Euchs received 96 strokes for receiving a parcel
containing bread, margarine, and sugar from a person outside the camp.
If necessary I can give the names of many other prisoners, viho were
beaten by Kliem. Other puardp. Y/hom T consider responsible for the

The following are some
of the TerheitskOi'Jmando.s from Neugrahen and Tiefstak:
1.	Zemcntfahrik.
2.	Gruscnstr.
3.	Italian Camp- (next to the cement factory)
4.	Billstr.
5.	Moller (brick salvage camp)*
I •myself worked :at the cement factory Diago. Here were 35 girls employed.
'We started work at 7„30 h in the morning and finished at 4.15 h with 3/4 of
an hour break at miduay. When we arrived hack in the evening we were
employed in building roads inside the camp. Me work y;as very heavy. we
made cement bricks and slabs for building emergency houses. .There were
two kinds of bricks. The first one was a large' square brick and.weight
24 kilos. Each girls had to make 28 of this a day. The second, was a long
flat concrete slab and weight 30 kilos when wet and 40 kilos when cry.
32 of these had to be made by each girl a day. It was very severs work and
much too heavy for girls to do. iie had no gloves most of the time, ..wiill
which to handle this very rough ocnore'ta material. During this work we
were supervised by civilian.- employees of the film, and guarded by two
of the camp staff. Most of the civilian employees helped us whenever they
could. One of the senior members of the firm named Thomsen was responsible
for the fact that women w/ere. employed:in his factory, doing work, that,
had originally been done by Italian P.o.W. at first there were 100 girls
working at the cement factory in two shifts of 50 girls, but Thomsen then
had this number reduced to two shifts of 35 each and later still further
reduced to 35 only. These 35 had to do the same amount of work as the 100
had to do at first. Thomsen was responsible for this, he was the person,
who told Kliem how many women were needed and Kliam supplies that number
without question. Thomsen also decided the amount of work that should be
done by each girl and Kliem-abided by his decision.
The worst jbeitskommando was that at Billstr. This place was more than
an hour's walk away' from the camp and there was no shelter for the girls
when the weather was bad. In addition to the one hour wolk in e3-c“
direction the girls had to'work at Billstr. for approximately 10 hours
a day. ibout 100- girls were employed in sorting out bricks from the bom
damaged buildings. Everybody, if possible avoided going to Billstr. Kliem
usually picked out those, who were sick and old or who haa displeased him
to work at Billstr. as a punishment and because he said they did not
deserve to live.
Neugraben and Teifstak were ..ussenkommandos of Neuengaame and, were
sometimes visited by officers from that camp. .Among those I have seen,
were Grimm, ifiedemann and Pauli. I do not know the other names, urimm
and .w-iedemann were Obersturmfuhrer, I think, and Pauli was of higher
5 T't	rank.
In my opinion Kliem was not of normal mentality. He would repeatedly
give orders and counter-orders. He would tell prisoners to do one thing
at one minute, and shortly afterwards would beat them for doing so.﻿♦

On the 21, March 1945 there *;as an air-raid nhich destroyed block I and
II	and about 1/3 of the roof of the dining room at Tiefstak. After this
time 180 women had to sleep on the concrete floor of the Spezialabteilung
and about 300 on the floor of the cevient works. There ..as approximately
one blanket and one stran mattress between three people. .'/hen everybody
..as lying down there was no room to walk between them the whole floor
was covered with people and bedding. No windows ..ere allowed to be
opened and w8 had no light. It mas so crowded that we could not even
get to the lavatory. The 4 doors of the cement works mere locked the
whole night. ,/henever there was an air-raid all the guards from the
cement works, went to a shelter so that the prisoners were left locked in
and with no possible means of escape in an emergency. During the
first 5 days after the air-raid and before the wire around the camp was
repaired the women were locked in the cement works as soon as they
arrived- back at camp that is, from 6 h in the evening till 6 h in the
morning. Beoaus of this we were unable to wash and became lousy.
The firm requested that the prisoners should be removed from the works
because they did not wish to rebuild the camp or to have the prisoners
working there any longer. This - as refused by Bauptscharfuhrer
who decided that the prisoners should remain ancHrebdiTcT't'fie ccnp
themselves.

Deposition on oath of Lotte Lang, female, of 3tade,
Holtemannstr. 7. Sworn before Ronald ./alter Rose, Capt. Essex
Regiment, of K. 2 'War Grimes Investigation Team, At Hamburg, on Pebryary
20th, 1946.
I an 24 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born in Prague.
Ivy permanent home is Iglau, paleckeho' 25, at present I am living in
Stade, Holtemannstr, 7.
In September, 1 944 I was one of 500 women who were transferred from
the concentration camp at Dessauer-Ufer to Neugraben-Falkenberg. All
had been arrested because they were Jewesses.
The living conditions in'Neugraben were very bad. Before our arrival
the camp had been an Italian P.o*W. camp. It was in an extraordinarily
dirty and unhygienic state.
I lived in Block III, which consistedof 6 large and 2 small rooms.
The large rooms were approximately 6 x 4 metres in size, in each of
these rooms about 25 women slept. The small rooms were about 1.5 x 4
metres. 6 of the kitchen staff slept in one of the small roorfis;
4 Blockftihrerinnen in the other. Too many people lived in these
rooms. We slept on wooden beds with only one blanket.
The meals were very badly cooked and definitely insufficient.
Breakfast: a very bad coffee. Lunch: "nothing. Supper consisted of
a very thin soup, about 20Q gr. bread, 2 gr margarine and a thin slice
of sausage. There was not sufficient plates and spoons available for
all persons, which sometimes caused quarrels among the prisoners when
they all tried to obtain plates at the same time.
The only clothing we wore consisted of 1 frock, 1 coat, 1 pair of clogs,
1 pair of knickers and 1 chemise.: Often some prisoners had no shoes at
all. Many difficulties were caused hwing to the clothing being
absolutely insufficient.
Generally there was no water to wash ourselves and water for cooking
purposes had to be fetched from a great distance. It had to be carried
in 50 1 containers. It took two women about 50 minutes to fetch 1
container filled with water'. it was impossible for us to wash.our
clothing. The lavatory*was in a very dirty state and it was impossible
to clean it, owing to the unhygienic conditions, bugs abounded in the camp.
No attempt was made to improve the conditions in the camp. Sometimes
when a visit by a higher officer from Neuengamme was expected, the
prisoners had to leave the camp by order of Hauptscharfuhrer. Klieri and
were not permitted to return until the visit was over; the Blockaltesten
had to make the camp appear to be in orde'r so that no reason for complaints
or questions existed. As the inspecting officer was decieved by false
facts and as none of -the prisoners were present to answer questions, he
was unable to learn the real conditions.﻿

- 2
ihe living conditions of the prisoners depended only on Hauptscharfuhrer
KLIEM. This nan vvas able to ease the life of the prisoners but never
made any attempt to do so. F1. i, tha.t the canal fron the "lavatory"
was often choked and the dirty water was about 30 cn deep in the yard
around the lavadory; and though Hauptscharfuhrer Klien had the
authority to call a plumber who was properly equipped, he demanded
that the prisoners - who had hardly.any shoes on their feet - should do
this work, and to make the canal free of water. In doing this work
it was necessary for the prisoners to stand in the canal. This
occurred several times. v/hen at last the work was unsuccessful he
called for a‘plumber.
.5
The nedical help left much to be desired as there was a lack of all
kinds of^instruments and medical supplies. The only time at which it
was possible to report sick, was between 7 and 8 o'clock a..n. ht
other times a prisoner could be almost dying and still had to work.
Owing to the unhygienic living conditions and particularly by the dirty
lavatories and the bad food, Dysentery was widespread in the camp.
The Revier was always full. The camp doctor was allowed to take in
only a certain number of sick people. If there was no spare bed
left the other patients had to go to work. Those who were lucky,
were admitted to the Revier, the others had to work, ill and with fever.
The work of the doctor was impeded by the lack of nedical supplies and
instruments. Operations had to be carried out on a wooden table with
no proper instruments.
I have seen myself how Hauptsoharfuhrer Klien beat prisoners in a very
brutal manner without having a reason. For example Erna Fuchs was
beaten by Hauptscharfuhrer Klien in such a manner, that his broad ’
leatherbelt was broken, because she had received a parcel containing
bread and sugar from a person outside. ilarianne Dux was beaten by
Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem so badly that,he broke some wooden objects,
which had been in the room, on her. As a reward she was allowed to
go to work the next day intthis terrible condition and was relieved
of her office as the Blockalteste. i(Three women, among then one, named
Lea Kurz, were beaten by Hauptscharfuhrer Klien over their whole bodies-
because they were suspected of having stolen potatoes. Hauptscharfuhrer
was such a sadist that it gave .him a special pleasure to stand
beside the exit with his rubber truncheon, and send off the prisoners
to work early in the morning with brutal blows and abuse, and to receive

believe _it v?as in February when we v?ere transferred fron Neugraben
to Tiefstak. Here the conditions were still worse than in Neugraben.
The food was worse, the work harder, and it was almost impossible to
contact civilians outside the canp.
Host of the tine I was in the canp kitchen. One day I was compelled
to go out with a working party at the firn of Holler. We had to
loosen frozen bricks with a kind of banner and to stake then up.
There I saw hoy/ terrible it was to work the whole day in our very bad
clothing in all kinds of weather. The life was made worse by the
fact that the women were constantly hungry.
_ Shortly before the end of the war we were transferred to Bergen-Belsen, '
and were told that we were to go into a better canp and to be taken
over by the Red Gross.
The transport fron Tiefstak to Belsen was one of the most terrible
experiences during all the years of imprisonment. 60 to 80 people
were put into a cattle truck and were on the way for several days,
I do not remember exactly how many. The small amount of food that
we received on the journey was mostly 'stolen and eaten By our^guards.
At the station where the trains for our transport were ready, I heard
a scream, and when I turned round I saw qy friend Kathe Grunwald lying
on the ground and being beaten and kicked by -B-in ;,n-PRtmn«ra>-i
so badly that she was already bleeding from her mouth. This lasted
for approximately 10 minutes. When I asked K&the why this happened,
she shrugged her shoulders and said: "I don't know".

In Belsen we were 10 days without bread or water until the English
troops arrived.

Deposition on oath of Gertrude Neumann, female, of Hamburg,
Breitenfelderstr. 68, sworn before Ronald Walter Rose, Capt. Essex
Regiment, No. 2 War Crimes Investigation Team at Hamburg on February 25,
1946.
I am 26 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at
Llitomerice. My permanent home is at Litomerice, Slajsova 5,
Czechoslovakia. I am at present Irving at Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 08.
I was arrested on the 30th of November 19^-1 in Prague, sent to
Theresienstadt, Bohemia, two years later transferred to Auschwitz, and
in July, 13KU- to Hamburg, (Dessauer-Ufer - labour camp). About two
months later I was transferred to Neugraben. At Neugraben there were
500 women nearly all Czechoslovakians.
The Kommandant at Neugraben was Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem. It was an
Assenkommando of Neuengamme, concentration camp. .AH the male guards
were Custom officials from Hamburg and wore the customs uniform. There
were also a number of 00 Aufseherinnen.
About A months later the entire camp including Kliem and all the other
guards was transfer.ed to Tiefstak, whe_e the guards changed into police
uniforms.
Prisoners were employed at a number of Arbeitskoinmandos. At Neugracen
most of the work consisted of digging, we has to make drainage systems,
this was at the worst time of the year when the weather was tery bad.
The ground was frozen and there u-s often -Snow. The ditches sometimes
were filled with water and we had to stand in them wearing only wooden
shoes. The clothing we' wore mt's not nearly sufficient to keep us
warm or dry. We had to lift and carry heavy iron pipes, which were,
placed in the ditches as drains. I remember one ditch that we had to
dig which was only just wide enough for us to stand in and was about 6
feet deep, the top of the walls was well about our heads.
When we returned to camp in the evening we vj,ere nearly always wet and
cold, but we only had two very thin blankets on our beds, therefore we
always had to use our coats to cover us. This was very bad for our
health as the coats were often soaring wet for weeks on end.
Other work at Neugraben consisted of felling trees and cutting them up
for firewood. Some of these trees were very big and it would have been
heavy work even for men. This work involved very heavy lifting jobs.
I was not actually employed at this work, which was called the
"Holzkommando", but I know that large logs had to be carried for great
distances.
The Kommandofuhrers were|jp.sef Muller.lirich Schulz and Hermann Jahn. Each
one was in charge of several working parties. _ Muller often beat the
prisoners working under him, on one occasion the Aufseherin Anita Fran
visitec the place where MulPer was in charge. For some reason she.
objected,.tQ~the-fce-haviour of one of the> prisonerF^andTbegan to beat her
very severely._____Josef Muller who ?;as the lover of Anita Frank saw what

Gustav Rosoly has never been seen by me to ill-treat any of the
prisoners, but X know that he was the cause of many of then-being^
punished because he made a habit of reporting every one he could to Jahn
or to Kliem.	■	'
Christian Koopmann was a great bully and was always shouting and_
threatening the women, he made them work harder than was necessciy.
Sonetines I have seen him hitting- prisoners,. .
'when we moved tojlie^sta^I worked at the foliomiaK ArjbeitskpcBandog:
.I. Mbn.ef1,aBerethere~ ..'as aTTarge'machine for breaming up
“—stones.	The stones were loaded on to trucks by hana
without gloves of any kind, and the trucks were then pushed
by us up to the machine and emptied into it.
This work was made even heavier by the fact tnat the
trucks had to be pushed up a small hill.
2. Some of the work at this firm consisted of sorting out
whole bricks from the ruins of bomb damaged buildings.
This was very dangerous work because there was always
the risk of falling walls, sometimes we had to climb
very high, and -every step we took was uncertain, ihe
wooden shoes we wore ..-ere loose and ill-fitting ana not
at all suitable for climbing on loose and slippery brides.
II. 'Ri I’lstrnfjse; about a. hundred women were employed here
in "sorting and stacking bricks from damaged -buildings.
Each person was expected to fincx and stack about 1-00
whole bricks per day. A few women searched for the
bricks which were then passed from hand to hand by other
women to those who were stacking them, .on the pavement..
This work was extremely heavy and tiring because the line
of women ..as sometimes so long that they coula not stano.
close to each other and pass the bricks normally, but had
to throw them from one to the other.
Others were employed in collecting all iron material from
the ruins. Great pieces of metal had to be lixtea ana
carried over the rubnle by us.
This was considered by us to be one of the 'worst kOmmandos
because apart from the-'heavy work we had to walk f or well over
an hour in each direction to ana from Billstr.
Our poor clothing and footwear made this, a great haraship.
Bauptscharfuhrer Kliem often made people work at this Kommando
as a punishment.
III. Purikturm; The work here consisted of digging tank ditches.
The ditches had to be very large.and it was very heavy work
because the soil was very wet and hard. It was in a very
open and exposed place. There was no shelter from the
weather, and we had to work even ..-hen ic was raining or
snowing.﻿- 3 -

IV.
Spadenlo.nd: Here we were employed in filling in 1)001)
craters near the hanks of the Nordurelhe. The weather
conditions wore the worst part about this work, the wind
was so strong that we had difficulty in standing up.
There was absolutely no shelter. Some of the craters
were huge, 30 or more women could stand around the edges.
They were very deep and there was nearly always water in
them. There ,;as a very long walk t® and from the place
of work, We were always absolutely exhausted, at the end
of the:day.
V. TatShberg: The work here was similar to that at Spacienlano..
During my work at the above places I witnessed many case's of
beating and ill-treatment, by the following guards:
G-eorge Heidtmann. He was a big and tall raand
him nearly every day hitting and kicking prisoners. ...W Snb
^ oochsXon .1 saw' bim' kidcxng. 'one of the woman about 20 times,
she was 'Very badly hurt .and afterwards had difficulty in
walking "l ack, she must .have been absolutely covered in bruises.
Heidtmann seemed to enjoy beating us and was apparently proud
•-s of the fant~that~ he did so. He was nearly always withthe
Arbeitskommando Muller. Many of the prisoners_were severely
injured by him. He was very unjust and often ill-treaj;ed
people merely because he took a dislike to_them. These
people he punished on evefy possible
Dcballbn while others
whom he liked were never punished
Erich Schulz
He was the Konmandofuhrer at the Holier Arbeitskontiiando.
He often kicked and hit some of the women working under him.
He would not allow us to rest or to warm ourselves and often
fwhen one of us made a small fire for this purpose’ or to heat
soup which we sometimes obtained, he would kick out the fire
upset the soup. On one occasion I have heard from other
prisoners who were with me that he had thrown some glowing
p embers at an old woman "who had bf?en keeping the fire burning.
and
| Zederkopf. I have not actually seen him beating anybody but he .
used to make us work terribly hard. HE whs shouting and bullying
I us all day long.	; • .	, j|lf-
After the air-raid at Tiefstak in March l$%-5 .<« were forced to
sleep on the stone floor of the cement factory. Zeaerkopf was
one of the guards at this place. There was hardly any room
for us to move and we were kept inside all night. Zeaerkopf
never allowed us even to use the lavatory or to obtain a^dririL
of water. He beat and kicked any prisoner who,attempted to do

Maria Szarole tta. I saw her once at Tatenberg beat a women named
Marianne Braun with a piece of wood. This was done because
Szaroletta and Anneliese Kohlnann had heard her shouting at
another woman. They did not understand the situation ana thought
that she.was shouting at them.. Braun afterwards had a badly
swollen face and her mouth was bleeding . This was particularly
bad because Braun had had trouble with her ear and it was
affected again by the beating.
Anneliese Kohlmann. She also beat the same woman for the same^
reason. They made no enquiries first of all in order^to fina

very often stole food and severely beat many of the prisoners.

Holte.nnanns.tr. 7, sy.orn before Ronald .('alter Rose, Capt. Essex
Reginent of No. 2 .for Crines Investigation lean, at Hanbdre, on
February 21, 1946. .
I tun 38 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at Bruenn,
At present I have no hone in Czechoslovakia, At present I an living
at Stacie, Holtennannstr. 7.
I aas a prisoner of the concentration canp at Nougraben- Falkenberg
and Tiefstale up to the tine when the whole camp was moved from Tiefstale
to Burgen-Belsen, approximately a fortnight before the end of the war.
In both camps I '.forked as a chief cook (bhefkoeohin).. The rations
which the prisoners received were too small, they consisted always of ••
vegetables, which could not be used by the civilians as they had gone bad
or were? frozen. If we received a meat ration it was meat of animals
or horses which had been killed during an air-raid. The meat was soiled
with sana and splinters so that we needed hours in order to clean it and
to make it eatable. For the cleaning we had a universal brush, which
was the only one available in the- kitchen and which was used for all
purposes. As not always 'sufficient -water was available the vegetables
and potatoes had to be cooked unwashed even if they were very dirty.
iis Hauptscharfuhre>r KLIM did not leave suff icient personnel in the camp,
the meal had to be cooked with the assistance of the patients of the
levier. These patients were often suffering grom infectious diseases
as impetigo, shingles, dysentry etc. Owing to this the meal became
very unhygienic. X also want to say that the prisoners mostly had open
wounds, as there was no other bandage material than paper bandages.
water had to be	fetched from a greater distance,	if	the pipes were
destroyed. it	lasted	about one hour	before the	girls	returned with	the
.water. Two girls.had	to carry a pot	with about	?0	1. Also the patients
from the revier	had to	make this long	way ..-ith a	16	1.	container in
e^ch hand. There were no breaks, for algo this work was watched by the
guards.
It 01 ten happened that IClieu would not allop., that a special soup was
cooked for the patients, although he knew/, that they could not eat the
normal soup of turnips and cabbage. I heard that Kliem said: "they shall
die like dogs"i
I have very often seen that Kliem beat the prisoners. I and all other
girls were eye-witnesses when Kliem beat girls, whose names had been
reported to hiwi by KoismandofuChrern because of "indecent behaviour'*.
Also I have some times seen, that the Aufs©herin, Anita Frank, beat girls
when they queued up to receive their soup. For beating she used the
ladle no matter whom and where she hit.
Gertrude Schulz had a very bad influence on Kliem, she used to agitate
him against the prisoners. Gertrude Schulz yas responsible for the
severe punishment of many prisoners.	----—.
I know 'with certainty that the Troviant>.ieisteiw Josef Kauenstein nortlv
dj.stri^uti-iL'o'ur-rations, among, the P-iurJ'as in addition to their rsti nriR,'

I also know that the Aufsohorinnon G-ortrudo Schulz and x Fi-
soautiix s gave food, which they'hSeT'"takfcn f rolh our rations, to their
fanilies.
Every Tuesday before the evening meal Kllera had a conference with the'
guards, in which he instructed then about the treatment cf the prisoners.
I heard that Hauptscharfuehre-r Klien said during one conference: "the
Jewish brute is not here to have a good life, they are dangerous vermin
(Volksschaedlinge) and have to be annihilated."
I have made this statement in German, which I understand perfectly.

On the 17th February 194-6, accompanied by Eva DONAT
and Lotte LANG, former internees of the concentration
camp at NEUGRABEN-FALKENBERG, I went to NEUGRABEN
and inspected the said camp.
Acting on the advice of the above two women, who
informed me that the camp still stands allmost in
its original condition I made the following tiro
plans:
Exhibit 'UN1
This plan shows the rough lay-out of the concentration
camp. The section surrounded by barbed wire consists
of the living accommodation for the prisoners.
Huts numbers 1 and 2 housed 500'female prisoners,
and were divided into 4 blocks as shown. Hut 3
was and still is only half completed, and has
never been used for any purpose. Hut 4 was the
ablution hut, which according to information from
the former internees, was divided some time after
the camp opened into two. The smaller section then
became the camp kitchen, and three vats wore
installed for cooking. Those vats still remain in
position. Hut 5 was the latrine.
The above buildings were surrounded by barbed wire,
which has now been removed, and there were two
watch towers at opposite corners.
The shaded buildings were the quarters of the camp
guard.
All the above buildings are of normal wooden construc-
tion similar to those at the main camp at NEUENGAMME.
The camp stands on a small hill immediately above
a larger camp which used to accommodate foreign workers.
All the buildings shown on the map are now used as
a Latvian Displaced Persons Camp.
Exhibit "B"
This is a plan of hut no 2 at the above camp. And
gives details of size of rooms and number of bods etc.
The measurements were taken by me and the other details
were supplied to mo by the tiro women, who accompanied mo.﻿-2-

On the 26th August 1939 I had to .join the Wehrmaoht. I became an Ob erf eld-

NEUGRRBEN was an Aussenkommando of the Concentration Camp NEUENGAMME. It
was established in September 1944*	1^ ^a-s "the successor of Untersturmfuehrer

In the camp there were 500 Jewesses, most of than were Czechs. The prisoners
had to build emergency houses. I was in charge of the cauia, and _had., nothing taJjo

I admit, that on manv occasions at NEUGRRBEN and TIEFaTiJt^I beat female

I am 56 years of age, of G-erman nationality, bom at JAUER/Silesia. My
permanent home is at H/uvIBURG 28, Veddeler Dana 11.
On the 13th of Sept. 1944, I was transferred to the Labour Camp NEUGRABEN
as a Konmandofuehrer, In the Camp there were 500 women, who came from
EESSAUER UFER at HAMBURG. We were forbidden to speak to the camp inmates and
to forward letters and parcels. If the prisoners went away from their working
place more than 20 meters, we were supposed to shoot. The first 4 weeks under
the command of Untersturmfuehrer SCHULZ, I was the second i/c.
The women had to do earth works. Small emergency houses were built,
for which they had to lay the foundation. Later, in December, it also happen-
ed that the women had to fell tress. But they took this wood into the camp
for heating purposes.
It was not allowed to punish the women. But in 2 cases I had to report
them, because the Gestapo interfered. These 2 women had been caught and
should be sent to NEUENGAMME, I persuaded the Gestapo to let the matter
rest, by just reporting them to the Gamp Commandant as another prisoner had
requested me not to be too severe. Both women received a beating by the
Comp Commandant.
I remember that Gertrude NEUMANN was caught one day by the caretaker,
when she received a parcel from a Frenchman. Therefore she was reported.
Then I went with the supervisor to the caretaker and tried to make him with-
draw the report, He did not do so and said only that I protected the women.
So I could do nothing but report her to the Camp Commandant, I did not take
Gertrude NEUMANN with me to KLIEMJ	As far as I can remember, he beat her
on the next morning before work commenced, but I have not seen it,

I allowed the women to keep small fires in order to warn their soup,

never kicked or beaten anybody,
I admit, what I have already told a Sergeant, that I have sometimes
beaten the prisoners, but I have only boxed their ear, I have never ill-
treated anybody.
I remember that once I have beaten a woman, who several times went away
from the working place together with her friend, in order to organize some-
thing for themselves. One day I met them both 500 meters away from the
working place and beat one of them, because she lied,

I am 45 years of age, of German nationality, born
at BAYREUTH, My permanent Hone is an :H4iffiURG-41tona,
Friedasnsallee 65.
On the 1st of Nov 1931 I joined the Party. ■ ids a
Customs official I became also a member of ■■the Beam-
tenbund in 1936. On the 13th Sept 1944 I was trans-
ferred to the camp NEUGRABEN as a guard. At first for
! month I was there as a guard. On the-whole I was
there for ? months. After the. first months T became
Proviantmeister, and was in charge of the transport
of the food into the camp.	11
Anita FRANK was in charge of the prisoners'"kitchen.
We collaborated in the way that I had to carry the
food into the kitchen by order of the Camp Commandant, -
Gertrud SCHULZ was the Rapportfuehrerin. She-made the
report of the sick people and of thoco, who had to go
to work. Anita FRANK, Gertrud SCHULZ and I wore the
only persons, who worked always in the camp. I was not
allowed to enter the camp itself. This was only allowed
to the Aufsaherin. I was only twice in the kitchen at
NEUGRABEN.
Generally the food was good. For breakfast there were
375 g of bread, but this was issued always the evening
before. Moreover margarine, sausage, marmalade, fish-
paste or white cheese.
Sometimes there was no bread for breakfast; but this was
only the case if the prisoners had eaten their bread the
sane evening when it was issued, because the rations for
the whole day were always issued the evening before.
As the women went out to work in the morning, they received
their lunch only in the evening. Then they received the
above mentioned rations of sausage, margarine, marmalade, or
artificial honey. The soup which received in the evening,
was the lunch. They received the following kinds of meat:
Beef, horsemeat and once also mutton. The horsomeat I got
from the Schlachthof at HARMURG. It is impossible that it was
dirty. I remember that once the refrigerator was hit by a
bomb, so that the beef stored there became dirty.
There vra.s never anything taken away from the prisoners'
rations for us. The goods were stored entirely separate.
Each Monday the stock was examined by means of a list.﻿-2-
This was dons by the prisoner LIA v/hose surname I do not
know* She was employed at the canp senior. I received a
paper directly from the camp commandant that this or that
thing should be issued. By means <?f those papers the stock
was examined. I do not know that ^hita FRANK and Gertrud
SCHULZ took anything out of the stock, - On Sunday I was
never there. Then the rations were issued by these two
girls. Therefore I cannot say whether these two have taken
anything*
In Jdn 19L5 we had still potatoes. They wore stored in a
potato-store. - At various occasions I have taken something
of the prisoners' rations by order of KLIEM. If I had borrowed
something, because I was a little short, I had to return this
at the beginning of the new period. If Gertrud SCHULZ has
given rations to her father, she did not receive them from
me. IfL went to HAMBURG to buy food, which very often happened,
some one else had to issue the rations. I was responsible
that the goods were brought into the camp and were issued to
the prisoners.
At some occasions Kanjmandofuehrer KLIEM instructed the guards.
On such occasions KLIEM said to us that we as guards Were for-
bidden to ..punish prisoners. This he said already on the first
day. KLIEM himself has beaten sometimes. But I have never
seen it I only always heard it.
The patient in the camp received a special diet and white bread.
The diet was semolina cooked in milk. One day the patients
received half a load of bread and the next day they got a whole
loaf.
It may be that sometimes I said a hard word and that
there was at some occasions not sufficient foody but
the prisoners got always what was due to them.
At one occasion PAULY and WIEDEMANN cane from NEUENGMMME
and inspected the store and cooling rooms. After this
inspection nothing in the camp was changed.

March 1946o
I am 50 years of age, German, born in Leipzig. My permanent hone is at
HiiMBURG-Gross-Flottbek, Emnichstrasse 19c
On the 19th Sept 1944 I came as a guardsman to the NEUGRaBEN Camp* At this
time the camp was just in the progress of being built. We have not received any
training, before we came to the Camp. It was our duty to guard the women, when
they moved to their working place, in the morning. We had to prevent women from
leaving the camp and had to see that none of them got in touch with the outside
world. However, we never got any specific orders.
I remember that in December 1944 I fired a shot into the air. After I had
fired, a foreworker came and asked me "What have you done?" I did not answer* I
have fired, because I wanted to chase away the foreign workers, who were standing
at the fences, talking to the women. I cannot remember that a specific woman had
talked with a Frenchman. It,was very dark, so that I could not see properly. I
could only hear the conversation, and therefore I fired the shot into the air. If
I had wanted to indicate a certain person, I would have gone there and sent her
away. Under no circumstances would I have fired the shot.
I once handed in a written report, when I saw guardsman RUNKEL chasing a
woman on the working place with a stick. This was in NEUGRABEN. The woman
wanted to go into the hut, because it was very cold outside. It was his duty to
see that she was not inside’the hut. I have seen that he had beaten her on the
back, and on the 8th Nov 1945 I made the report to the Mil Gov. The guardsman was
not punished.
It was our duty to make reports if the prisoners did not want to work or
escaped. I only reported prisoners, if it.was really necessary. At those occasions
they were punished by the camp leader KLIEM.

I am 59 years'of age, of German nationality, born at H/UVfflURG-Altona.
My permanent home is at HAJVJBIIRG-Altona, Rothestr. 79.
I never have been a member of the NSDAP.	I was never forced to join
the Party, so that I could keep my job, without joining the Party.
In Sept. 194-4 I was transferred from the Customs office to the
Concentration Camp NEUGRABEN. It vvas .my-duty to lead the prisoners to
thS; work in the morning and to guard the can*. It was one of our orders
that we should shoot, IF a person approached the. camp from the outside,
but I never did it.
If we supervised the working parties, it was our duty to take care that
the prisoners worked well and did not run away - I never reported a woman.
Only in one case I beat a woman with a light fist on the shouldex, as
she tried to escape. Except this case I have never beaten or kicked any
woman, I very often shouted at the women, if it_had to be, and therefore
I think that these witnesses did not give good evidence against me.

Approximately on 20th September, 1944 I was sent to NEUGIl.iBEN-Pji.LKENBERG. This

thorn Vrere Czechoslovakian and I believe that there were, some Dutch and a few

I was in charge of parts of the ^rbeitskommandos of NEUGRA3EN.
At the end of January or the beginning of February 1945 the whole ,camp was
transferred to TIEF3TAK. Here I had to do the same work.
During the time I was an Aufsuherin, I have seen that. Runkel, ANNELIESS KOBLMANN and
CHRI3TEL DIBSSEN maltreated prisoners. At Billstr., one of'the places the prisoners
had towork, I saw on one occasion RUNKEL beating a woman, he beat her down and then
kicked her. I do not know why he did this, but I heard later that the woman
had left the work for a short time. On another occasion I saw that HONKEL beat a
woman into the face. This happened because she was absent at the time thfflo
prisoners had to line up in order to return into the camp.
Once I have seen, that Anneliese KOfflf/IANN, another Aufseherin, beat a prisoner
into the face.	',

Deposition on oath of Gertrude Neumann, female, of Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68,
sworn before Ronald Walter Rose, Oapt. Essex Regiment No. 2 ’far Crimes
Investigation Team at Hamburg on Februaiy, 26, 1946*
I am 26 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at Litomerioe. Ufy
permanent home is at Litomei-ioe, Slajsova 5, Czechoslovakia. I am at present
living at Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68®
In December 1944- and January 1945 I was in the revier at Neugraben concentration
camp as a result of a severe beating I had received from the Kommandant
Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem.
One evening instructions were given to the nurse of the ward in which I was, that
two of the beds were to be immediately emptied to mai® way for two women who had
been injured by a falling wall, while working at Harburg. The wooden table which
was used as an operating table was also prepared.
Later on that evening the two women were fetched into the room by some mem, I
think one of the men was from a hospital and the other one was the guard Emil Jufers*
One of the women was named	tZgigUmUHM. who was a fizanhoalovakiam and the
other whose name I cannot remember was of	orinin and also
Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem and I think the guard Mulsow also entered the room. The
nurse of this ward was named Kohn. I cannot remember her Christian name but we
called her Betty.
The women were attended to at once. Both of them were very severely injured and
the greater -art of their bodies was covered with plaster of Paris. Reichmann
I think had injured her spine because her whole nock and shoulders was incased
in plaster. And the other woman was in plaster from the waist downwards®
Reichmann was delirious and the other woman could hardly speak at all.
They first of all had been taken to an ordinary hospital, but they received no
treatment there. It was obvious to me that they should not have been moved
for in the camp revier there was no proper equipment or medical supplied, to deal
with them. There was not sufficient room to handle such badly injured people
and it was extremely oomplioated and awkward for the doctor to treat them. In
order to set the broken bones one of the patients had to be stretched out on
ordinary small vodden stools.
There was no doubt that being brought, to the camp revier their chances of
recovery were made extremely poor. If they had been left in a proper hospital
nd received treatment by more skilled and qualified.surgeons they would have
had a far better chance of recove,ry.
They both died within the next two days,.
I have made this statement in English, which language I understand perfectly.

sworn before Ronald.Walter Rose, capt. Essex Regiment, No. 2 War Crimes
Investigation Team, at Hamburg, on.February 22, 1946.
I am-33 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at Hamburg.
My permanent home is at Hamburg, Heilwigstr. 2)4, where I am at present living.
Approximately in September 1944:1 was moved from Dessauer-Ufer as a
prisoner, to Neugraben ■ and. later to .-Tiefstak. I was Vorarbeiterin in the
cement factory, Diagowerk, Tiefstak.
One. ddy I received a parcel from an unknown person, who told me to
distribute it among the women of my working party. I took the parcel with
me into the factory. The parcel contained bread, sugar and margarine. I
hid the parcel among material in the factory. About 14.00 hrs an Aufseherin
of Neuengamme, named Erik, arrived at the factory for a control. She found
the parcel and searched my working bag. She found money and the addresses
of some foreign relatives. She started to beat me with her fists, then she
took the parcel and the bag and left the working place.
In the evening when we returned to the camp I was received immediately
with beatings .by Kliern. He took me to the Kommandantur in order to investigate
me. He wanted to know the name of the man, ’who gave me the parcel, which I
did not know. He said I was a liar, took off my spectacles, and beat me
several times into the face. Then. I had to undress my frock, to bend over a
chair, and he beat me with a leather belt which he doubled, .after about
50 strokes Kliern sent the Aufseherin ..Gertrud Schulz, who was present up to
now, out of the room and said: "Leave the room, you will not bear it any
longer". He beat me, until I fell on the.floor, several times I fainted for
some moments and was always called id dphsoience by his beatings. He told
me also if I. would faint, he .would beat me to death,
.He. seized me, at the hair and forced me: to.bend over the chair again.
During the beating the belt broke and he took a new one from a nail at the
wall. He continued,to beat me. and to kick.me with his boots,.
After I had promised Kliem to report the person who gave me the parcel,
if he would return,- he let' me go, I tumbled out of the room. I had two
fingers of the left hand broken. Moreover I was blind on the left eye for
a fortnight■and the,right ,eye was badly affected. Also after 8 months the
marks of the beatings were to be seen. At the beginning of November 1945 I
.made a statement before. Capt. Alexander of J.A.G. .War Crimes, I showed him
the- marks of the.-beatings by Kliem, tip- to. to-day I am suffering from, loss
of memory.and from headache.'	. .
:u'.0nc» during the: beating .Kliem threatened me with a pistol, which.-he.
pointed to my. head. But as I.could only tell him the truth, he continued
beating mo.	.	,
I tried to get on hands and feet out of the room, but Kliem kicked
me and said>. that I was exaggerating, he. forced me to tumble' out. .Before the
house two of my.comrades assisted me to get into my hut.

oommand (iixbeitskornmando) viz. to Billstr., which was the heaviest
hrbeitskommando of the camp and lay at the greatest distance. On the way
to Billstr. I was not able to walk alone and was half carried by my comrades
As I was not. able to work, the guard, named Johannes. Mulsow, hid me
,in a shelter, although he was ordered by Kliem to force me to work.
When we returned from the work in the- evening I had to go to the
Kommandantur again, there I was cross-examined by HauptscharfUhrer Kliem
and an officer from Spaldingsti-. in presence' of the Aufseherin Gertrud
Schulz.: Also this officer beat me several times into the face, when! I could
not make any other statements.
Kliem ordered that I should not receive any food for 8 days.

I am 22 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at
Olomouc, Czechoslovakia. My permanent home is at Sternberg, Smetamova 6,
I am at present living at Stale, Sch&ferstieg 15.
In the beginning of March 194-5 I have been working in the cement
factory Diagowerke Tiefstack. The Vorarbeiterin in my group was Erna FUCHS.
One day I have seen a civilian near the factory who asked me to call
Erna FUCHS. She came and he gave her a small parcel containing bread,
margarine and sugar. He left and she took the parcel y/ith her to the factory.
A few hours later Hauptscharftihrer KLIEM came,to visit the factory with
female Aufseherin from Neuengamme. Ho found Erna FUCHS in possession of the
parcel and started kicking her and beating her 'right on the spot. He asked
her for the name of the person who gave her the parcel. As she claimed she
did not know, he took her to the Commanders barrack and promised to bite her
until she would tell him the name of the civilian. We heard her screaming
in a distance of about a 100 metres. Aufseherin Anita FRANK told us that
Erna FUCHS was beaten with a leather belt and received 96 strokes. I have
seen Erna FUCHS coming out of the Kommandantur. She was bleeding on her face
in her head and on her back and she could not see on the left eye. 'We brought
her straight to the camp doctor's office. After she recovered a bit she
was called before KLIEM again and was told that she was dismissed from her
job as Vorarbeiterin and that she has to report the next day for work in
Billstrabe which ms the worst of the Arbeitskommandos.

■68y sworn before Horn Id Walter Rose, Capt. Essex Regiment, No.2 War Crimes
Investigation Team at Hamburg on February 26, I946.
I am 26 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at Litomerioe. My
permanent hone is at Litctnerice, Slajsova 5, Czechoslovakia, I am at present
living at Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68.
During the time I was a Neugriben as a prisoner I think it was in the first
week of December 1944- I received a parcel from a person outside the camp. It
contained dry bread.
This was observed by some people living nearby, (an elderly man and his wife).
They shouted that it was not allowed and threatened to report the matter to the
Gestapo.
The Kommandofhhrers Erich Schulz and Josef Mhller came to me afterwards and
told me that they had tried to persuade this couple not to report me. But in this
they had been unsuccessful. Therefore they said that they would have to report it
themselves to Hauptscharfiihrer Ivliem, otherwise they would get into trouble
themselves for not doing so.
Schulz took me with him to Eliem and made a report on the occurrence. Eliem
asked'me my number and sent me back to the camp.
The next morning when we were assembled and ready to leave the camp for work
my number was called out by Kliem and I had to go to him in full view of all the:
other prisoners in the camp.
Kliem questioned me for a short time. I could not tell him the name of the
person who had given me the parcel. He then told me to take off my coat and
asked for his piece of rubber hose, which was filled with compressed air, and t#ld
me to bend down. He gave me two severe blow's on ay back. Then he told me to take
off my overall, and with all his force he continued to beat me with the hose for
about 25 times. Most of the blows fell across my back, across my waist and in the
region of the kidneys. He hit me repeatedly and without pause, my whole back from
my shoulders downwards was covered with blows.
*t U1' ' '
This happened I think on a Friday and in spite of my severe punishment I was
still forced to go out to work. And as a further punishment I had to work on the
following Sunday when most of the girls were resting.
The result of my punishment was that I had greatest difficulty in walking,
standing, and sitting or lying down. I was in great pain and had to receive
assistance even to get on to my bed.
A few■days later the pain had increased a great deal and I could not longer
walk alone. I was bent almost double and could not straighten myself up, I had
to go to the camp doctor and was kept in the camp revier for over two months
suffering from the effects of the beating.
I am still suffering from the after effects and still have to receive
frequent treatment fran a specialist. His name is Professor Hopf, Oberarzt of
Eppendorf University Clinic, and he can certify that my present ill-healths the
reaialt of the punishment I received while a' prisoner, jnad the bad living
conditions.

I am 45 years of age, of German nationality^ born at Hamburg.
My permanent heme is at Hamburg, Klosterallee 5, where I am at present
living. I am a specialist for skin disease and Head Doctor "the University Skin
Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf.
Frau Gertrude Neumann received hospital treatment from me from December 3>
1945 to January 12, 1946. Her complaint consisted of heavy elongated skin
eruptions and gland poisoning lasting an unusually long time, as the result of the
complete breakdown of bodily resistance. Moreover she was suffering from severe
depression and was in an accute state of shock.
The over all physical and mental exhaustion can only be the result of heavy
suffering and shocks to which Frau Neumann was exposed in the concentration camp.
It is highly probable, that the definite maltreatment which she suffered
there according to her statement has helped to a large degree to worsen her general
condition.

former active soldier, and custom official since 1st
June 1922.
I have been employed at HAlvITtIRG as a custom official
and on the 14th September 1944 I vras transferred to

Approximately in the middle of January 1945 I was as

morning I heard screaming. '.Then I hurried to the place
I found that a mail had fallen dorm and had buried two
female prisoners. As Kommandofuehrer I imnidiately su-

severely injured.
At first I ordered that the two women were brought into
a private house where they were bandaged. Then I got
two cars and drove with them to the auxiliary hospital
FMKTURM V/IL;EilMSBT ’G, where I delivered them, although
I knew that this was forbidden.
Then I called up the Camp Commandant KLEM and reported
the incident. His first question was whether they were
dead and I said no but -they are severely injured. Then
he said very angrily whether I did not know that this
was forbiddonl Then he ordered that the two women should
be immediately removed from the hospital. 1 then told him
he should call up the hospital himself. The guard KAiSELGR
was >rdered to, take charge of the, return of the prisoners.
The two vromen were of Czechoslovakian nationality and I
know that both died shortly afterwards in the camp.

G-redenerstrasse 0/0 '.JTSGSR, at present No. 1 O.I.C.
sworn before me. Staff Sergeant Prank Peter GOLDING, 3th
Kings Royal Irish Hussars of War Grimes Investigation Unit
at NEUMUEM3T3R on 1st of June 194-6:
I am Otto KASHLUR, occupation: gardener, born on Ipth
January 1913 at HAISUEG, of German nationality.
Until about September 1939 I was employed as a gardener
at HAMBURG. Shortly before the beginning of the war I
was called up for the imaiitry. On tne poh April 19':-0
I had an accident with the motorcycle and broke my knee
cab. I am still suffering from the consequences of the
accident. As I became unfit for service I was discharged
from the Amy and joined the customs service on 13th
September 194-0. On the 14-th September 194-4- I was trans-
ferred as a guard to the Aussenloom:.iando of the concentra-
tion camp liUENGA!®,® together with 150 other customs
officials. We were.sent to DBSMUSR-UFKR in the dock-
area of HAMBURG	G) where we were received, by Ober-
sturmfuehrer GRIStvI and his Adjutant, . Hauptscharfuehrer KLXJI.
I myself, together with 2k other custom officials, was
transferred to the Ausssnkommando NUTCSABHN. There I stayed
until we moved to TIEP3TAK at the beginning of Pebruary
I94.5 and some days later I was transferred to the Aussen-
koramando at SPALDING3TR.
When I arrived in September 1944 the Aussenkoramanao it&LWKAisSN
v/as commanded by Tint rsturrnfuehrer SCHULTZ, but he mas al-
ready discharged after about k weeks. Then the camp was
taken over by Happtsoharfuehrer KLIEM who -<vas camp comaandan.
until the camp closed down.
In the camp there were 500 Jewesses of Czechoslovakian
nationality. The women had to go to work aaily except
on Sundays'. Only the sick and the parties which were
employed in the camp remained there. The work outside
the camp was earthen work and auxiliary work on ouxlcang
sites. Approximately in December 1944 the.working parties
at HAMBURG-HARBIIRG were employed in clearing away bomb
debris.
I myself had to guard a working party. It was only my duty
to guard the women so that they could not contact wit
civilians or escapel In order to increase the amouno of work,
of the prisoners 3A-peoplo were employed aiter he ovn-r
had complained about the small amount of work.
m opinion the work was too heavy for women and would
h!ve b°en too severe even for men. Host of the women were
to a	condition b.oanal^aok of food.
fre.r nntly that women, who were just discharged from he
Son S to norm In oivi.lion life those »ula have boon﻿considered sick, but as there was not sufficient room in
the Revier they had to go to work.
In January 194-5 an accident happened on fty working site.
Thilc the prisoners were clearing away bomb debris a wall
fell down and buried an SA-man and two female prisoners.
I ordered that rescue work should be started immediately and
after a short time the 3 persons were saved. The SA-msn
was not injured seriously, .'he two women seemed to oe
injured very severely and moaned terribly. A forewoman
of my prisoners, named Frau Dr. POLACK from PRAGUE
gave' them’ first aid immediately. Korananclofuehrer
HOPPE, Wilhelm, a custom secretary, wad also.there and
we ordered that they were to oe ceansxerred inuO a hos-wu 1.
This was at about 1100 hrs. I believe HOPPE accompanied
them to the hospital. At about Ip.30 hrs he returned and
told me that in the raecntime he had informed Hauptschar-
fuehrer KLIM by telephone. HOPPE told me that KLIM was
very annoyed and that he blamed us for talcing the Jewesses
into a hospital instead of taking them back into the
camp. KLIM ordered me to return the injured girls to
the camp as soon as possible.
I then tried to get -an ambulanc from the Office of the
Airraid Protection District (Sinsatzstelle des Luft-
sc’ utsbszirks). The■policeman on duty refused uo place
an ambulance at tlie disposal of* concentration ccmp^ in*-
mates after he had made various telephone-calls. Then I
telephoned KLIM again and he told me that the o nor .of
the firm had to give us a par. I could get only an open
lorry. Together with a driver I drove to the hospital
where we arrived at about 1800 hrs.
I saw a female doctor who was apparently imormed already
that the two women wore to be taken away. Two doctor asked
me what kind of girls they were as they had a number ua-tuooed
on the left fore-arm. I then asked in vnat condition
the two injured prison ;rs r:re and. the. doctor told me
that their condition was very severe and that she could
not take the responsibility for their removal.
The to/o "-iris we -e still under an anasthetic and lay naked
on a hospital trolley. It was shortly, after the operation.
I asked for some blankets and I told the. doctor ^
I hr d only ci open car. She, gave the patients .an xrgecuion
to alleviate their pains on the journey. KLIM 'niew
doubtlessly that the women were seriously xngureo as oarer- ^
wise wo would not have taken them into the hospital. As HOPES
was Kommandofuehrer KLIM- held him responsible lor^awing
the women into the hospital. KLIM made it clear that
concentration camp prisoners, especially Jewesses,
under no circumstances be taken into a hospital, no m -
whether dead or living.
Consequently I had to execute HfIM*s orders and to con- ..
tinue mth the transport, of the women, although I personally
had the strictest scruples. I did not oelxeve	uro
women would survive the journey, ffe mu women on o.

I am convinced that the doct>v of the Revier had not the
necessary equipment and madic-aments for such severe cases.
Two or three days later the two women died. Both were of
Czechoslovakian n; tionality.
While I vras a guard in the camp I have twice seen
SLI'II heat prisoners "before they -.rent to work. KLIM
used a red rub er hose about 70 cm long for this purpose.
This was at H@UGRA.BM, aperowimately in November 19^+4.
This ha polled because a guard reported that cabbage as
stolen. The two gir^s had to let down their overalls and
received about 20 strokes on the back and behind. They had
to bent forward, end finally they fell down. They cried
and later when they had to go to work they groaned and
complained of pains. The prisoners were beaten in public
before all the other prisoners.
I also remember that once, KLIM while on the way to the
workin 'lace repeatedly oeat one oi tno Czecliosloawnun

Ich bin ^tto KAEHLER, G-aertpner von -'eruf, geboren am 15» Ja-ntiar
1913 in Hamburg, Deutsche Staatsangehoerigkeit.
B
Bis um September 1939 war ich in Hamburg als Q&ertner taetig.
Kurz nach Ausbruch des Krieges wurde ich $ur Infanterie eingezogen.
Am 5.4.1940 hatte ich einen Unfall mit dem Motorrad und brach
meine Kniescheibe. An den Polgen des Unfalles leide ich jetzt
noch. Da ich dienstuntauglich wurde, wurde ich von der Amee
entlassen, und trat am 18.9*1940 in den Zolldienst. Am 14.9*1944
wurde ich zusammen mit 150 anderen Zollbeamten als Wachtposten
fuer die Aussenlager des Konzentrationslager NEUMGAIME abkominan-
diert. Wir wurden zum Dessauufer ira Hamburger Preihafen geschickt
(Schuppen G) wo wir von Obersttanfuehrer ffiTOdUBai GRIEU unfl
seinem Adjudanten , ^auptscharfuehrer KLIEM in Empfang genommen
warden. Ich selber wurde mit 24 anderen Zollbeamten zu dem
Aussenlager Neugraben abgestellt. Dort blieb ich his zur eber -
siedelung nach TIEPSTACK Anfang Februar 1945 und ein paar Tage
spaeter wurde ich zum Aussenlager SPALDINGSTRASSE vei^e^zt.
Das Aussenlager NEUGRABEli wurde zur Zeit meiner Ankunft in September
192(4 von Untersturmfuehrer Schultz komruandiert, der aber schon
nach circa 4 Wochen entlassen wurde. Das Lager wurde dann von
Hauptscharfuehrer MBHH ICLIE!.l uebemommen, der bis zur Aufloesung
LAGERKQIMANDANT war.
In dem Lager waren 500 juedmsche Frauen tschechischer National-itaet.
Die Frauen mussten taeglich ausser Sonntags zur Arbeit ausrueckCn.
Im lager blieben nur die Krgaken zurueck und die im Lager Beschaef-
tigten Kommandos. Die Aussenarbeit bestand aus Erdarbeiten und
Handlagerarbeiten fuer Bauuntemehmer. Ungefaelir im Dezember 1944
wurden die Aussenkonimandas in Hamburg-Harburg fuer Aufraeunungs-
arbeiten eingesetzt.
Icb selber hatte die Bewachung einer Arbeitsabteilung upter mir.
Es war lediglich meine Aufgabe, die Frauen zu bewachen, sodass sie
nichtmit Zivilpersonen in Verbindung treten komten oder flueohten.
Zwec.ks Erhoehung der Leistungen der Gefangenen waren SA-LEUTE
eingesetzt, nachdem von dem lUntemebjner Beachwerden ueber die
Arbeitsleistungen gemacht worden waren.
Meiner Meinung nach war die Arbeit zu schwer fuer Frauen und
waere selbst fuer Maenner hart gewesen. Die meisten Frauen waren
in geschwaechtem Zustand durch Nahrungsmittelmangeljund es kam
auch haeufig vor, dass Frauen, die erst gerade aus dem Revier
entlassen worden waren, zur Arbeit eingesetzt wurien. Im Zivilleben
haetteman solche Frauen als krank betrachtet; da aber nioht genug
Platz im Levier war, mussten sie zur Arbeit ausruecken.﻿2-
Im JANtJAR 1945 ereignete sich in der mir zugeteilten
ArbeitsstaStte ein UnTall. Vfaehrend der Aufraeumungs-
arbeiten fiel eine Wand ein und verschuettete einen
-s-SA-Mann und 2 der ■weiblichen Haeftlinge. Ich liess
sofort Rettungsarbeiten'durchfuehren und nach kurzer Zeit
batten v/ir die 3 Personen geborgen. Der SA-Mann.- war nicht
ernstlioh verletzt. itaartiffiriMihiBa'ia^KtdangffigataejanwDnr'idraEi
Die 2 Frauen schienen seflr ernst verletzt zu sein und
jaffitahmBtm v/imr/ierten schrecklioh. Ema Vorarbeiterin raeiner
Haeftlinge, eine Frau	Dr. POIAGK aus HiAG-
gab sofort erste Hilfe. Kbmmandofueb-rer HOPPE, Wilhelm,
ein Zolisekretaer, vra.r ebenfalls zur Stelle und wir
veranlassten die ueberfuehrung ins Krankenhaus. Das ungefae’nr
um ll.oo Uhr. Ich glaube, HOIPE fuhr mit ins Krankenhaus.
Ungefaehr um 13. 30 Uhr kern HOPPE zu mir zurueck und sagte
mir, dass er inzwischen den Ha>jpt s char fuehrer IUuIIII telephonisch
benacbrichtigt ha be. HOEEE sagte mir, dass KKEEM ausser sich
sei, und machte uns den Vorwurf, die duedimien in ein Kranken-
haus gebracht zu liaben, anstatt sie zum Lager zurueclczubringen.
KLlH'i erteilte mir den ^efehl, die Verwundeten Maedels auf
dem scVsnellsten wege zurueclczubringen.
Ich versuchte dann, einen Kranlcenwagen von dsr Einsatzstelle
des Luftschutzbezirlcs zu bekommen. Der Diensthabende Polizist
lehnte es ab, einen , rankenwagen fuer KZ-Insassen zur Verfuegung
su stellen, nachdemer mit verschiedenen Stellen telephoniert
hatte. Daraufhin telephonierte ich wiederum mit KLEEM und er
gab mir den Bescheid, dass der ifflMatoaaganirn^m bauunteme’nmer^
einen Wagen zur Verfuegung stellen musse. Ich konnte nur einen
offenen .Last1/.,'agen bekommen und mit diesem fuhr ich dann mit
dern Fahrer zum Krankenhaus, wo wir gegen 18.00 Uhr ankamen.
Ich sah eine Aerzt&n, die anscheinend bereits Bescheid mfe
wusste, dass die 2 Frauen abzuholen waren. Die Aerztin fragte
mich, was^ denn das fuer itaedels y/aeren, da sie eine Hummer
auf dem linken Unteram eintaetovdert. hatten% leh erkundigte
mich dann,ueber den Zustand der zy/ei Verwundeten Maeebhen*
Die Aerztin sagte mir, dass der Zustand sehr emst sei und
dass sie keine Verantwortung fuer den Transport uebemehmen koenne.
Die beiden Maedchen waren noch in der Narkose und lagen nackend
auf einem Operationswagen. Es war kurz nach der Operation.
Ich bat um ein paar ^ecken , und erklaerte der Aerztin, dass ich
nur einen offenen Wagen haette. Sie gab den Verletzten noch
eine Spritze, sodass sie aid’ dem Transport Linderung hatten.
KLIEM ,+wusste zy/eifgllos, dass die Frauen schwer verletzt waren,
da v/ir sie sonst nicht ins Krank^enhaus gebracht haetdsen.
Da HOPPE KCM-IMDCFUEHRER war , machte ihn KLIEM dafuer verant-
wortlich, dass er die Frauen ins Krankenhaus gebracht hatte.
EECEM machte es klar, dass itoamm KZ-Haef tlinge, be senders
Juedinnen auf keinen 51 all in ein Krankenhaus zu bringen seien,
gleichgueltig, ob tot oder lebendig.
Infolgedessen musste ich den efehl KLIEM, s ausfuehren uind
mit dem Abtransportieren der Frauen fortfahren,' obgleich ich
persoenlich die groessten Bedenken hatte. Ich glaubte nicht,
edass die Frauen den 'transport ueberleben koennten. Wir legten
die Frauen auf den Wagen hinten den Fuehrersitz und deckten sie
mit den geliehenen Daclcen und dem Persdsnning des Lastvvagens
zu. Gegen 21.00 UhrUcamen v/ir in dem Lager an und lieferten die
Frauen im Revier ein. Die Frauen lebten und wimmerten.
Ich bin ueberzeugt,dass die Aerztin des R viers nicht die notv/endigJ
Hilfsmittel und Arzeneien fuer derartig emste Faelle zur ^er-
fuegung hatte. Zv/ei oder drei Tage spaeter starben die beiden
Frauen. Beide waren tschechischer Wationalitaet.
Waehrend ich '‘achdienst im Lager hatte, habe ich zv/eimal
gesehen, v/ie KLIEM vor Arbeitsantritt Haeftlinge geschlagen hat.﻿
KLjEM benutzte dazu einen roten G-urnmischlauch , ungefaehr
70 cm lang. Dies war in NbDG-RABBN, imgefaehr^im November
Igiiif. Dies war aus dem imlass einer ^eldung eines 'x os tens,
dass Kohl gestohlen worden sei. Die zwei Maedchen muss ten
ihren Overall herunterlassen und belcamen daim cii'ea 20 Dchlaege
aufs Gesaess und auf den Ruecken. Sie mussten sich vorwaerts
beugen und schliosslich fielen sie auch bin. 2ie sehrieen und
suae ter, wenn sie zur Arbeit harausmussten, wimmerten sie und
klagten ueber Schmeraen. Das G-anze spielte sich vor der gesemteri
angetretenen Belegschaft ab.
Ich eri mere mich auch noch, wie KLlEj.I einmal eine der

Ich war Oberlirztin auf der chirurgischen Krankens ation
im Flakturm WILHELMSBURG von August 1944 bis Juni 1945.
Am lo.Januar 1945, vormittags warden zwei schwerv.rletzte
Frauen in den Flakturm gebracht, die bai Aufraumungsarbei
tan schwer verletzt worden war.n. Ich w^iss dieses Datum
ganau, da ich mir uebar den Vorfall sine kurze Notiz
gemacht habe. Beide Frauen hatten Nummern auf dem
Unterarm tatowiert, eine Nummer habe ich mir notiert.
Es war ® A 4848
Eine Frau war bewusstlos and h&tte einen Schadelbruch.
Die amdere hatte eine Verletzung der Brustwirbelsaule
mit Verletzung des Rtickenmarkes. Ausserdem hatten beide
Frauen noch verschiedene Knochenbrtiche und leichtere
Weicht ailve rlet zung en.
Die Frau mit dem Schadelbruch war bewusstlos, di;

Investigation in
NEUGRAB3N and TIEFSTAK Ccnoentration Canp
PREAMBLE
1)	In 1944 the HEUENGA Z E concentration camp administered
approximately 50 Aussenkommandos, 13 of them for female
prisoners. One of those Aussenkoimuandos was the NE0GRA-
BEN concentration camp. The camp was situated a few
hundred yards South of the main road from HA1 HJRG to
CTJXHA2EN. Plan marked "Exhibit A" shows a rough lay
out of the camp. The camp stands on a small hill imme-
diately above a larger camp* which at tuat time con-
tained foreign workers. It is still in existence
in almost exactly the same form as at the time of its
occupation by concentration camp prisoners with exception
of such things as barbed wire etc.
2)	The living quarters of the concentration camp inmates
ware large3 wooden huts similar to those at the HSUEN-
GAZ -E main camp. "Exhibit A" shows plan of prisoners
huts. The living quarters consisted of 2 huts containing
2 blocks each. In addition there was an uiululu^ien eetuTiorfS
and a small kitchen, which was installed some time
after the prisoners moved into the carp, and latrines.
The whole-lay-out was surrounded-by barbed wire with
2 watch towers at opposite comers.
3)	In September 1944 500 women, mostly Czechoslovakian
Jevresses.moved from the c amp at DESSAI: IR-UPSR to the
above described NEUGRABEN camp. Until that time the
camp at MUGRABEN had been an Italian PoW camp.
4)	The concentration camp prisoners were guarded.by
25 guards-men who were formerly customs officials
of the HA 'BURG port. The Commandant of the camp,
who was responsible for the running and the super-
vision of the misoners was at first SS-Untersturrn-
fuehrer Otto SCHULZ, and from the loth October 1944
SS-Kaupt sdharfuehrer Friedrich K' XSII. In addition
" there were about 5 SS women em loyed as guards
at NEUGR&BEN.-The camp prisoners ware enployed.
in building emergency houses and in digging drainage
channels. This was very heavy work, involving.^
the lifting and carrying of great weights. Evidence
has been collected to shows that this work.had to be
carried out under most unfavourable conditions.
5)	The clothing of the concentration camp.inmates was
totally inadequate.for climatic conditions (Winter
1944/5).﻿Sheftt 2
6. The food was- kept at starvation level and of p or
quality.
7.	Medical su-plies were also totally inadequate, and ;;here
was not enough accommodation in the prisoners' hospital.for
the sick.
8.	The accommodation of the prisoners was crowded.In r- oms
measuring 7,50 metres by 5 metres 22 to 26 women were
accomodated. The c -imp hospital contained beds for 26
patients.
9.	The two most common types of gunishment were
a)	25 lashes with a rubber hose
b)	depriv/ation of food.
10.	In addition to the"official beating" handed out by the
camp Commandant most of the SS- and customs officials
guards used to beat the women very frequently.
11.	On the 5th February 1945 the entire .camp:was transferred
to TIEFSTiK near EiUTlURG* The camp was situated in the
grounds of a factory called DIAC-OWEREE, which manufactured
cement slabs and bricks. Here the living conditions of
the prisoners were even worse. When the prisoners arrived
at that canp it was in an unfinished condition. Neither
beds nor blankets were-available and living facilities ftufc
as light, toilets etc. were not completed.
12.	The 500 women slept in 2 huts. "Exhibit C" is a plan
of the cement factory and the camp, and shows the dimensions
and*Btati-gB relating to the number of people in each
room etc.
13.	On the 21st M rch 1945 an air-raid partly destroyed
some of the camp's buildings and the director of the
DIAGOWERiaS recommended that the camp should be evacuated.
This request was i^gnored and living conditions became
worst then at any other time of the camp's existence.
14.	The work which the prisoners had to do, while at -TTfiFSTiilt,

was
again out of proportion to their physi^w.
At Tiefstak there were a few additional guards. These
people -were also customs officials. In addition more
SS women were posted to the camp. Beatings and other
forms of punishment continued on a wide scale.

PRESENTATION of the case
16.	Many of the original 500 women internees at E'UGRABEN
are still alive. All are potential witnesses as to Con-
ditions, which existed in the Camp.
17.	However, an effort has been made to prepare the case
against the accused by using as few witnesses as po-
sible, in order to streamline the proceedings.
1,8. All witnesses have been chosen with regard to the
following facts:
a)	Intelligence and good memory,
b)	Specialised knowledge of some particular parts
of camp life (medical, cooking, hygiene etc.)
c)	Actual victims of illtreatment or witnesses of
specific instances.
If. The case has been divided into 2 sections:
1) General Conditions
£) Particular instances concerning individuals.
20.	All members of the Camp Staff must be considered respon-
sible for the "General Conditions" of the Gamp, A few of
the vrorst characters were dealt with separately,
21.	Evidence collected shows that the Camp Commandant Frie-
drich KLIEM is responsible for at least 2 murders.
22.	It has been difficult to obtain evidence of many spe-
cific instances, but it must be realised that in Con-
centration Camps such as these, beating or other forms
of cruelty v/ere commonplace. And familiarity with such
scenes eventually drives names and other details into
the back-ground.
GENERAL CONDITIONS.
23. Both Camps are described and evidence was obtained re-
garding overcrowded accomodation, insufficient and bad
quality clothing and food, lateR of medical supplies etc.
Zb. An emphasis has been laid on the extreme severity of
the work, whichf the prisoners had to perfoi-m. A number
of working commandos have been described, and one of
the*,the DIAGOWERKE at TIEFSTAK, has been investigated
in great detail#. Exhibits are produced to prove the
severity of the work.
25.	The reason for this particular commando being singled
out was the ease of obtaining exhibits, and the fact
that the same work is still being carried out today
by paid'German male Workers. A responsible member of
the"Firm DIAGCW3RKI has given evidence, describing the
work and stressing that it was too heavy, and an unsui-
table employment for undernourished women.
26.	It is suggested that the. Court should be adised by the
Prosecution to adjourn to the DIAGOYffiRKE g© and form
.<?﻿SHEET 4
and form an opinion for themselves as to the severity
of this work.
27. The following witnesses have given evidence:
1) Eva DOHiRT, Block Senior
gives evidence on conditions,
clothing, food, .edical arrange-
ments, punishments, work, latte of
air-raid -precaution, hygene.
2) Lotte LAIyG,

sickness, punishment and work.
3) Gertrud

TIEPSTisK and details of the
manufacturing process of cement
briks and slabs, as carried out
by the prisoners.

Deposition on oath of Eva Donat, female, of Sternberg, Smeta-
mova 6, Czechoslovakia, sworn before Ronald Walter Rose, Capt.
Essex Regiment of No. 2 War Crimes Investigation Team, at Hamburg,
on February 20, 1946.
I am 22 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at
Olomouc, Czechoslovakia. My.permanent home is at Sternberg,
Smetamova 6, I am at present living at Stade, Schaferstieg 15-
On the 21, March 1945 there was an air-raid which destroyed
block I and II and about 1/5 of the roof of the dining room
at TiefstaM-fter this time 180 women had to sleep on the con-
crete floor of the Spezialabteilung and about 300 on tne floor
of the cement works* There was approximately one blanket and
one straw mattress between three people. When everybody
was lying down there was no room to walk between them.the
whole floor was covered with people and bedding. No windows
were allowed to be opened and we had no light. It was so
crowded that we could not even get to the lavatory. The 4 doors
of the cement works were locked the whole night. Whenever
there was an air-raid all the guards from the cement works
went to a shelter so that the prisoners were left locked m
and with no possible means of escape in an emergency.
During tlie first 5 days aftsr tiie air-raid and bexore tiis
wire around the camp was repaired the women were locked
in the cement works as soon as they arrived back at camp
that is, from 6 h in the evening till 6 h in the morning.
Because of this we were unable to wash and became lousy.
The firm requested that the prisoners.should be removed

Deposition on oath of Lotte Lang, female, of Stade,
Holtemannstr. 7. Sworn before Ronald Walter Rose,
Capt, Essex Regiment, of No. 2 War Crimes Investi-
gation Team, at Hamburg, on February 20, 1946.
I am 24 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality,
born in Prague. My permanent home is Iglau, Paleckeno
25, at present I am living in St de, Holtemarmstr. 7
In September 1944 I was one of 500 women who were
transferred from the concentration camp at Dessauer-
Ufer to Neugraben-Falkenberg. All had been arrested
because they were Jewesses.
The living conditions in Neugraben were very bad.
Before our arrival the cmp had been an Italian
P.o.W. camp. It was in an extraordinarily dirty
and unhygenic state.
I lived in Block III, which consisted of 6 large
and 2 small rooms. The large rooms were
approximately 6x4 metres in size, in each of
these rooms about 25 women slept. The small
rooms were about 1,5 x 4 metres. 6 of the
kitchen staff slept In one of the small rooms?
4 BlockfUhrerinnen in the other. Too many
people lived In these rooms. We slept on
wooden beds with only one blanket,
very
The meals were.badly cooked and definitely
insufficient. Breakfasti a very bad coffee.
Lunch* nothiftg. Supper consisted of a very
thin soup, about 200 gr. bread, 2 gr, margarine
and a thin slice of sausage. There were not sufficient
plates and spoons available for all persons,
which sometimes caused quarrels among the
prisoners when they all tried to obtain plates
at the same time.
The only clothing we wore consisted of 1 frock,
1 coat, 1 pair of clogs, 1 pair of knickers and
1 chemise. Often some prisoners had no shoes at
all. Many difficulties were caused owing to
the.clothing being absolutely insufficient.
Generally there was no water to wash ourselves
and water for cooking purposes had to be fetched
from a great distance* It had to be carried in
50 1 containers. It took two women about 30
I﻿
- 2 -
minutes to fetch 1 container filled with water.
It was impossible for us to wash our clothing.
The lavatory was in a very dirty state and
it was impossible to clean itf ©wing to the un-
hygfenic conditions^abounded in the camp.	I’-k-
Ho attempt was made to improve the conditions in
the camp. Sometimes when a visit by a higher officer
from Heuengamiue was expected, the prisoners
had to leave the camp by order of Hauptsehar-
fUhrer Kliem and were not permitted to return
until the visit was overj the Blockaltesten
had to make the camp appear to be in order
so that no reason for complaints or questions
existed. As the inspecting officer was deceived
by false facts and as none of the prisoners
were present to answer questions, he was unable
to learn the real conditions*	*
The living conditions of the prisoners depended
only on HauptscharfUhrer SZLIEM. This man was able to
ease the life of the prisoners but never m de any
attempt to do so. F. i. that the canal from the
•lavatory" was often choked and the di% water
was about 30 cm deep in the yard arouhd the
lavatory | and though Hauptscharfiihrer Kliem
had the authority to call a plumber who was
properly equipped, he demanded that the pri-
soners - who had hardly any shoes on their
feet - should do this work, and to make the
carnal free of water. In doing this work
it was necessary for the prisoners to stand
in the canal. This occured several times. When
at last the work was unsuccessful he called
for a plumber.
The medical help left much to be desired as there
was a lack of all kinds of Instruments and
medical supplies* The only time at which it was
possible to report sick, was between ? and 8
o’clock a.m. At other times a prisoner could
be almost dying and still had to work, ffata
o«mc\ to wascnnsusaddtey the unhygienic living conditions
p.W
and particularly by the dirty lavatories and the bad food.
Dysentery was widespread in the camp. The Revier
was always full. The camp' doctor was allowed
to take in only a certain number of sick people.
If there was no spare feed left the other
patients had to go to work. Those who were
lucky, were admitted to the Revier, the others
had to work; ill and with fever. The work
of the doctor wr-s impeded by the lack of
medical supplies and instruments. Operations
had to be carried out on a wooden tablewith
no proper instruments.
I have seen myself how HauptseharfUhxer Kliem
beat prisoners in a very brutal manner without
a manner, that his broad leilherbelt was
broken, because she had received a parcel﻿Hauptscharfiihxer Kllem so badly that he broke
some wooden objec'ls/ ’’i-ich had been in the
room, on her* As a reward she was allowed to go
to work the next day in this terrible condition
and was relieved of her office as the Block-
Slteste. Three women, among them one, named
Lea Kurz, were beaten by H&uptscharfiihrer Kllem
over fciieir whole bodies* because they were
suspected of having stolen potatoes. Hauptschar-
flihrer Kliem was such a sadist that it gave
him a special pleasure to stand ©side the exit
with his rubber truncheon, and send off the prisoners
to work early in the morning with brutal blows
and abuse, and to receive them in the same
manner in the evening. In my opinion Hauensteln.
the Proviantmeister and Anita Frank. IKS
Kiichenaufseheria, were res: onsTbie for the fact
that we did not get our full rations - which
were very small in any case,-and they benefitted
themselves by it. The HapportfUirerin Gertrud
Schulz was also guilty of steeling our rations?
1' have often seen her giving foodstuffs
to her father.
Jonnv Miiller« Ko.m&Mofiinrer of a working fiarty
which Had to stack brickf, often caused
women to receive 25 lashes, by Informing
HauptscharfUhrer Kliem that they had stolon
something from the ruins* He himself was
very interested in steeling as much as possible.
I know this because Joiuiy Miiller put down the
names of these girls in his notebook and then
passed the names over to Kliem; these women
were beaten the next day.
One day Herta Kostscheck came back from her
work toothless. Wken T asked her how this
had happened she told me that it was the
work of Albert Runkel.
I have also often seen how Anita Frank has
beaten women.
I believe it was in February when we were
transferred from Seugraben to Tiefstak.
Here the conditions were still worse
than in Meugraben. The food was worse, the work
harder, and it was almost impossible to
contact civilians outside the camp.
Most of the time I was in the camp kitchen.
One day I was compelled to go out with a
working arty at the firm of Mbller. We had
to loosen frozen bricks with a kind of hammer
and to stack than up. There I saw how terrible
it was to work the whole day in our very bad
clothing in all kinds of weather. The life
was made worse by the f act that the women
were constantly hungry.
Shortly before the end of the war we were
transferred to Bergen-Belsen* and were
told that we were to go into a better camp
and to be taken over by the led Cross.﻿4
The transport from Tlefstak to Belsen was
one of the most, terrible experiences
during all the years of imprisonment•
60 to 80 people ware put into a cattle-
truck and were on the way for several days,
I do not remember exactly how many.
The small amount of food that we received
on the journey was mostly stolen and eaten
by our guards.
I
At the station where the trains for our
transport were ready, I heard a scream,
and when I turned around I saw my friend
Kathe GrUnwald lying on the ground and
being beaten""and kicked by the Aufseherin
Kertha, so badly that she was already bleeding
from her mouth. This lasted for approximately
10 minutes. .Vhen I asked Kathe why this
hap; ened, she shrugged her shoulders
and said* "I don’t know".
In Belsen we were 10 days without bread or
water until the English troops arrived.
I have made this statement in German, which
language I understand perfectly,

Deposition on oath of Gertrude Neumann, female,
of Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68, sworn before
Ronald Walter Rose, Capt. Essex Regiment, No. 2
War Crimes Investigation Team at Hamburg^on Fe-
bruary 25, 1946.
I am 26 years of age, of Chechoslovakian nationa-
lity born atLI&itomerice. My permanent home is
at Litomeriee, Sla^sova 5, Czechoslovakia,
am at present living at Hamburg, Breitenlelaerstr.
68.
I was arrested on the 30th of November 1941 in
Prague, sent to Theresienstadt, Bohemia, two
years later transferred to Auschwitz, and in
July 1944 to Hamburg, (Dessauer-der - labour
ramr) About two months later I was transferred
to Neugraben ..At Neugraben there were 500 women
nearly all Czechoslovakians.
The Kommandant at Neugraben was Hauptscharfiihrer
Kliem. It was an Aussenkommando of Neuengamme,
rrvnrpritration camp. All the male guards were
Custom officials from Hamburg and woie the customs
uniform. There were also a number ox Auf
seherinnen.
About 4 months later the entire camp including
Kliem and all the other guards was transierred
S	3uaTClS 1^/3
Prisoners were employed at a
irommandos. At Neugraben most of the work con
of digging, we had to mate ^arnage systems,
this was at the worst time of tne year wnen me
weather was very bad. ihe ground was frozen_
and there was often snow. The difches sometimes
were filled with water and,	thine
them wearing only wooden sho^'	uf
we wore was not nearly sufficient to keep us
warm or dry. We had to	f^^ditchls
iron nipes, which were placed in tne ciixcnes
as drains. I remember one ditch that^we had
to dig which was only oust ¥ude enough x r
us toSstand in and was about 6 feet	d
the top of the walls was well about our heaas.
flhen we returned to camp in	?Jen3f
wptp nearly always wet and cold, but
It only SS two ver? thin blankets on our

wet for weeks on end.

Other work at Neugraben consisted of felling
trees and cutting them up for firewood. Some
of these trees were very big 'and it would have
been heavy work even for men. This work involved
very heavy lifting jobs. I was not actually
employed at this work, which was called the
''Holzkommando", but I know that large logs
had to be carried for great distances.
The Kommandofuhrers were Josef Muller.^rich
Schulz and Hermann Jahn. Each one was in charge
of several working parties. Muller often beat
the prisoners working under him,on one occasion
the Aufseherin Anita Frank <yisited the place
where Muller was in charge. For some reason
she objected to the behaviour of one of the
prisoners and began to beat her very severely.
Josef Muller who was the lover of Anita
Frank saw what was happening and immediately^
began to beat the woman also, and he kicked
her as well. The victim afterwards had many
bruises and a black eye. o-"'''’
The guards at the above Arbeitskommandos.
that I can remember were Georg Heidtmann,
Albert Runkel, Gustav Rosoly, Christian
Kooomann, Paul Schubert, Christel Dibbern,
Eva-Maria Earowski, Anneliese Kohlmann,
Maria Szafoletta,(Mia) Otto Kahler,
Emil Juhrs, Elavier, Johannes Mulsow,
Otto Bdttcher, Kohler. l/do not know all
their Christian names.
Albert Sunkel was very brutal at Neugraben
and on one occasion I saw him shooting at
a woman named Tieber, who was trying to
shelter from the wind behind a building.
This woman had a daughter in the same
camp and she was rather elderly and^
the hard work and terribly bad weather
was much worse for her than for the rest
of us.
Gustav Rosoly has never been seen by me_
to ill-treat any of the prisoners, but I
know that he was the cause of many of them
being punished because he made a habit
of. reporting every one he could to Jahn
or to Kliem.
Christian Koopmann was a great feully_
and was always shouting and threatening
the women, he made them work harder
than was necessary. Sometimes I have
seen him hitting prisoners.
When we moved to Tiefstak I worked at
the following Arbeitskommandos:
1. MSller; here there was a large
machine for breaking up stones.
The stones were loaded on to
trucks by hand without gloves
of any kind, and the trucks
were then pushed by us up
x
(f﻿^5
- 3 -
to the machine and emptied into it.
This work was made even heavier
by the Tact that the trucks had to
be pushed up a small hill.
2. Some of the work at this firm
consisted of sorting out whole
bricks from the ruins of bomb-
damaged buildings. This was very
ftflngerous work because there was
always the risk of falling walls,
Sometimes we had to climb very
high, and every step we took was
uncertain. The wooden shoes we wore
were loose and ill-fitting and not
at all suitable forxsdaahx climbing
on loose and slippery bricks.
II. Billstrasse; about a fesraatS
hundred women were employed here
in sorting and stacking bricks
from damaged buildings. Each person
was expected to find and stack
about 400 whole bricks per day._
A few women searched for the bricks
which were then passed from hand
to hahd by other women to those
who were stacking them on the
pavement. This work was extemely
heavy and tiring because the
line of women was sometimes so long
that they could not stand close to
each other and pass the bricks normally,
but had to throw them from one to
the other.
Others were employed in collecting
all iron material from the ruins.
Great pieces of metal had to be
lifted and carried over the rubble
by us.
This was considered by us to be
one of the worst Kommandos because
apart from the heavy work we had
to walk for well over an hour in
each direction to and from Billstr.
Our poor clothing and footwear
made this a great hardship. Haupt-
scharfuhrer Kliem often made people
work at this Kommando as a punishment.
III. Funkturm; l^e worm ne
tank ditches.
The work here consisted of
nk ditches. The ditches had
weather, and we had to,work even when
it was raining or snowing.﻿- 4 -
Z£
IIV. Spadenland; Here we were employed in filling in
bom! craters near the banks of the Norderelbe.
The weather conditions were the worst part
about this work, the wind was smssiiKiss so
strong that we had difficulty in standing up.
There was absolutely no shelter. Soaje of the
craters were Hugh, JO or more women could stand
around the edges. They were very deep and there
was nearly always water in them. There was a
very long walk to and from the place of work,
We were always absolutely exhausted at the
end of the day.
V. Tatenberg; The work here was similar to that
at Spadenland.
During mv work at the above places I witnessed many
have seen him nearly every day hitting and kicking
prisoners. On one occasion I saw him kicking one of
the woman about 20 times, she was very badly hurt
and afterwards X had difficulty in walking back,
she must have been absolutely covered in bruises.
Heidtmann seemed to enjoy beating us and was
apparently proud of the fact that he did so.
He was nearly always with the Arbeitskommando
Miiller. Many of the prisoners were severely injured
by him. He was very unjust and often ill-treated
people merely because he took a dislike to them.
These people he punished on every possible occasion
while others whom he liked were neverpunished.
Erich Schulz.
He was the Kommandofuhrer at the Mbller Arbeitskommando.
He often kicked and hit some of the women working under him.
He would not allow us to rest or to warm ourselves
and often when one of us made a small fire for
this purpose or to heat soup which we sometimes
obtained, he would kick out the fire and upset
the soup. On one occasion I have heard from other
prisoners who v^ere with me that he had thrown
some glowing embers at an old woman who had been
keeping the fire burning.
Zederkopf. I have not actually seen him beating
anybody but he*used to make us work terribly hard.
He was shouting' and bullying us all day long.
After the air-raid at Tiefstak in March 1945	\
we were forced to sleep on the stone iloor of
the cement factory. Zederkopf was one of the guards
at this place. There was hardly any room lor us to
move and"we were kept inside all'night. Zederkopf
never allowed us even to use the lavatory or to
obtain a drink of water. He beat and kicken Qn'T
prisoner who attempted to do so.
Christel Dibbern. I have seen her hitting people
with her hands and sometimes she used a branch
from a tree.﻿Maria Szaroletta. I saw her once at Tatenberg beat
a woman named Marianne Braun with a piece of wood.
This was done because Szaroletta and Anneliese
Kohlmann had heard, her shouting at another woman.
They did not understand the situation and thought
that she was shouting at them. Braun afterwards
had a badly swollen face and her Siouth was bleeding
This was particularly bad because Braun had had
trouble with her ear and it was affected again
by the beating.
Anneliese Kohlmann. She also beat the same woman
for the same reason. They made no enquiries
first of all in order to find out the real reason
why Braun was shouting. At Tiefstak Kohlmann
very often stole food and severely beat many
of the prisoners.
I have made this statement in English, which-
language I understand perfectly.

Deposition on oath of Paul Seeliger, male,of Hamburg 27,
Andreas Meyerstr.52
Sworn before Captain Honald Walter Hose/The Essex Regt.,
of Ho. 2 War Crimes Investigation Team, at Tiefstak, on
20th February 1946
I am 40 years of age, of German nationality, born at
Bochum. My permanent residence is at Hambg., Andreas
Meyerstr. 52, where I am at present living.
I am employed at the firm Diago-Werke MOller & Co. as a
purchaser and foreman since 10 years.
In December 1944 we received an order from the con-
centration camp Heuengamme (Bauverwaltuag) to build
a camp for 500 women. We were ordered to finish the
camp for February 15, 1945 and we were told to build
a hut 42,50 metres : 12,50 metres. We knew that this
hut would be too small for 500 persons and therefore
drew the attention of the authorities to the fact,
that we would build a second hut. The authorities
agreed with this proposal.
On February 5tdi at 6.00 h in the evening 500 women
arrived at the camp guided by SS-HauptscharfUhrer
K 1 i e m . The guards were police-officers from
the oust4m—house, also some SS-Aufseherinnen arrived.
As the prisoners arrived 9 days too early , the
camp was not finished. There were no beds, no blankets
and straw mattresses were available. Also the lava-
tory had to be repaired. There were no lights.
According to my opinion the camp was by no means
comfortable when it was finished, but it was certain-
ly not comfortable when the prisoners arrived. We
had strict orders from Heuengamme, so that the con-
ditions could not be improved, although we really
wished to do so. We asked for 1500 blankets but re-
ceived only 500.
The prisoners had to work in the following Arbeitskom-
mando s:	.
55 women
Cement Factory

Dyckerhoff

The above numbers may not be quite correct but as far as
I can remember they are right. The work in the above mention-
ed Arbeitskommandos was work for men and very heavy.
1﻿I myself know only the Arteitskommando ttZementfakrik”.
The prisoners had to make tricks (hollow) and cement
slats. The sand has to te transported and will te mixed
in a machine with cement and water. Then the material
will te moved in carts to the working-place. The women
had to shovel it into forms and to stamp it. The
stamp weight atout 1 kg. After the stamping the iron
forms were removed ty the women and the slats,which
lay on a wooden plank, had to te transported to
the store-place, which was atout 50 metres away.
After the slats had dried the women had to carry
several slats daily to the store, which was some-
times 100 - 150 metres away from the drying place.
One slat weighfce/ atout 30 - 55 kg. The women had
also to effect the transport of the sand, this
was made in the following way: the carts ?fere driven
to the sand hill ty the women, was loaded ty means
of shovels with sand and was pushed to the mixing^-
machine, which was atout 200 metres away. A cart
contains atout 1 cbm.
It was not possible that a civilian worker could
assist the women as always a guard was present who
could see that, moreover Hauptscharfuhrer Eliem
was always in the camp.
It was obvious for everybody that the work was too
heavy for the women.
My first impression of Eliem was, that he was a real
devil. I have very often seen that he teat the pri-
soners with a rubber tube. The punishment depended
only on the mood of Eauptscnarfuhrer Eliem. I have ,
not seen that other guards punished the prisoners.

Heilwigstr. 44, sworn before Ronald Yfalter Rose,
Capt. Essex Regiment, No. 2 War Crimes Investigation
Team at Hamburg, on Pebruary 22, 1946.
I am 33 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality,
born at Hamburg, My permanent home is at Hamburg,
Heilwigstr. 44, where I am at present living.
I was a prisoner at Neugraben and Tiefstak from
September 1944 until we were moved to Belsen,shortly
before the end of the war. Conditions in this
camp ware very bad and unhygienic and living
accommodations were crowded.
Eauptscharfuhrer Eliem and many other guards Tfere
very b,rutal and cruel. I have Very often seen,
that Kliem beat prisoners in public.
Other guards,who ill-treated the prisoners, were
the following:
Georg Heidtmann. lie was a guard and was in charge
of the. women. I have often seen, that he beat,
kicked and ill-treated th	ften
seen, that he beat women onl^’did not
line up quick enough in order to go bo work
Albert Riinkel. I have seen, that he threatened
prisoners with a pistol and that he beat and
kicked them. When ever a prisoner received a
parcel or present from persons outside the camp,
he took it away and destroyed it. A woman, named
Tieber, Susanne, was especially badly beaten by
Ruenkel because she had received a parcel from
somebody outside the camp. Oh another occasion
he shot his pistol at the mother of Busanne
Tieber.
Gustav Rosoly. I have not seen, that he beat a
person but I know, that he reported a great number
of prisoners and therefore was responsible for
their punishment.
CHRIBTIAN EOQfMANN. This man has very often beaten
and kicked prisoners, I have seen it myself.
Gerhard Spanjar. This man often boasted that he
had been with the Gestapo and was one of the
oldest members of the NSDAP.
Zederkopf. I have often seen that this man beat
and ill-treated prisoners. After the air-raid on
Tiefstak I was one, of a great number of women,
who were forced to sleep on the floor of a part
of the cement factory. This man was one of the
guards. The. room was terribly crowded and we were
﻿- 2 -
not allowed to leave the room dmring the night.
Zederkopf even prevented us tre- go to the lavatory
or to drink a glass of water. When the prisoners
were forbidden to use the lavatory and when they
tried to use another place Zederkopf kicked and
beat them and tried to prevent them from doing so.
Hertha. I cannot remember the surname of this woman,
but we nicknamed her MZirkusreiterintt, as she had
been employed in aicircus. She used brahches of the
willow in order to beat the prisoners, I have often
seen it.
Gertrud Schulz. This woman was responsible for many
punishments, as she reported many prisoners to
Sliem. She used to search the prisoners and con-
fiscated everything she could lay hands on.
Anita frank. Thsj. woman told me that she was a
voluntary member of the S3. She worked in the
kitchen. I have not seen that she ill-treated
anybody, but I have often been told that she
did it.
I remember another Aufseherin, named "Inge".
She was very' brutal. I have often seen, that
she,, ill-treated prisoners only because they
smiled or because of other small offences.
I made this statement in German, which I know
perfectly.

I am 25 years of age, of German nationality, born

St. Benedlktstr. 30# where I am at present
living.
I am a halfjew and therefore shortly before the
end of the war I was forced to clear up the bomb
debris at Wilhelmsburg. Later I worked at Tief-
stak.
One day, I suppose it was in March 1945, I worked
at the stone smasher together with the women of
the concentration camp, Diagower^:,cement factory,
and I watched the following occurrence*
I was in the hut in which we used to eat our
meals and saw through a window that some
women tried to take cabbage from a railway truck.
One of the guards of the concentration camp,
named Erich Schulz, also watched this incident.
He shouted at the wome^,chased than away and
kicked one of them in the back. I do not know
the name of this woman.
On an other occasion I saw how the Aufseherin
Kohlmann ill-treated a woman. It was an elderly
woman who wanted to go with several other women
to the lavatory. Kohlmaan seized her and threw
her on the floor, her com^rades had to assist
her to get up. I do not know why Kohlmann did this.

In December 1944 and January 1945 I was in the
revier at Neugraben concentration camp as a
result of a severe beating I had received from
the Kommandant Hauptscharfiihrer Kliem.
One evening instructions were given to the nurse
of the ward in which I was, that two of the beds
were to be immediately emptied to^^^v	^ ^ork
two women who had been injured fern an alr-rai-d '
at Harburg. The wooden table which was used
as an operating table was also prepared.	P"
Later on that evening the iwo women were fetched
into the room by some men, I think one of the men
was from a hospital and the other.one was the
guard Emil Jiihrs. One of the women was named
Anna Reichmann, who was a Czechoslovakian and
the other whose name I cannot remember was of
Polish origin and also a Czech.
Hauptscharfu.hrer Kliem and I think the guard Mulsow
also entered the room. The nurse of this ward
was named Kohn. I cannot remember her Christian
name but we called her Betty.
The women were attended to at once. Both of
them were very severely injured and the greater
part of their bodies was covered ?/ith plaster
of Paris . Reichmann I think had injured her spine
because her whole neck and shoulders was incased
in plaster. And the oteier woman was in plaster
from the waist downwards. Reichmann was delirious
and the other woman could hardly speak at all,
They first of all had been taken to an
ordinary hospital, but they received no treat-
ment there. It was obvious to me that they should
not have been moved for in the camp revier there
was no proper equipment or medical supplies to
deal with them. There was not sufficient room
to handle such badly injured people and it was
extremely complicated and akward for the doctor
to treat them. In order to set the broken bones

one of the patients had to be streched out on
ordinary small wooden stools*
There was no doubt that in being brought to the
ca4p revier their chances of recovery were made
extremely poor. If they had been left in a
proper hospital and received treatment by more
highly skilled and qualified surgeons they
would have had a far better Kahn chance of re-
covery.
Thg>y both died within the next two days.
I have made this statement in English, which
language I understand perfectly.

Deposition on oath of Gertrude Heumann, female, of
Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68,. sworn before Ronald
Walter Rose, Capt. Essex Regiment, Mo. 2 far
Crimes Investigation Team at Hamburg on February
26, 1946.
I am 26 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationa-
lity, born at Litomerice. My permanent home is
at Litomerice, Slajsova 5> Czechoslovakia. I
am at present living at Hamburg, Breitenfelderstr. 68.
During the time I was at Neugraben as a prisoner
I think it was in the first week of December 1944
I received a parcel from a person outside the camfi.
It contained dry bread.
This was observed by some people living nearby,
(an elderly man and his wife,}. They shouted
that it was not allowed and threatened to report
the matter to the Gestapo.
The Kommandofu.hrers Erich Schulz and Josef Muller
came to me afterwards and told me that they had
V tried to persu^ade this couple not to report me.
But in this they had been unsuccessful. Therefore
they said that they would have to report it themselves
to Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem, otherwise they would
get into trouble themselves for not doing so.
Schulz took me with him to Kliem and made a
report oh the occurrence. Kliem asked me my
number and sent me back to the camp.
The next morning when we were assembled and ready
to leave the camp for work my number was called
out by Kliem and I had to go to him in full view
of all the other prisoners in the camp.
Kliem questioned me for a short time. I could,
not tell him the name of the person who had given
me the parcel. He then told me to take off my
coat and asked for his piece of rubber k°se,
which was filled with compressed air, and told
me to bend down. He gave me two severe blows
on my back. Then he told me to take off.my
overall, and with all his force he continued
to beat me with the hose for about 25 times.
Most of the blows fell across my back, across
my waist and in the region.of the kidneys.
He hit me repeatedly and without pause,
my whole back from my shoulders downwards
was covered with blows.
This happened I think on a Friday and in spite
of my severe punishment I was still forced to
ko out to work. And as a further punishment
I had to work on the following Sunday when
most of the girls were resting.﻿2
The result of my punishment was that I had
greatest difficulty in walking,standing, and
sitting or lying down. I was in great pain
and had to receive assistance even to get on
to my bed.
A few days later the pain had increased a great
deal and I could no longer walk alone. I was bent
almost double and could not straighten myself up.
I had to go to the camp doctor and was kept
in the camp revier for over two months suffering
from the effects of the beating.
I am still suffering from the aftereffects and
still have to receive frequent treatment from
a specialist. His name is Professor Hopf, Oberarzt
of Eppendorf University Clinic, and he can cer-
tify that my present ill-health is the result
of the punishment I received while a prisoner,
and the bad living conditions.
I have made this statement in English, which
language I understand perfectly.	^

Deposition on oath of Erna Fuchs, female, of Hamburg,
Heilwigstr. 44, sworn before Bonaid Walter Bose, Capt.
Essex Begiment, No. 2 War Crimes Investigation Team,
at Hamburg, on February 22, 1946.
I am 33 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality,
born at Hamburg. My permanent home is at Hamburg,
Heilwigstr. 44, where I am at present living.
Approximately in September 1944 I was moved from
Dessauer-Ufer as a prisoner to Neugraben and later
to Tiefstak. I,was Vorarbeiterin in the cement fac-
tory, Diagowerk, Tiefstak..
One day I received a parcel from an unknown person,
who told me to distribute it among the women of my
working parpy. I took the parcel with me into the
factory. The parcel contained bread, sugar and mar-
garine. I hid the parcel among material in the fac-
tory. About 14.00 hrs an Aufseherin of Neuengamme,
named Erik, arrived at the factory for a control.
She found the parcel and searched my working bag.
She found money and the addresses of some foreign
relatives. She started to beat me with her fists,
then she took the parcel and the bag and left the
working place.
In the evening when we returned to the camp I was
received immediately with beatings by Kliem. He
took me to the Kommandantur in order to investigate
me. He wanted to know the name of the man, who
gave me the parcel, which I did not know. He said
I was a liar, took offmy spectacles, and beat me
several times into the face. Then I had to undress
my frock, to bend over a chair, and he beat me
with a leather belt which he doubled. After about
50 strokes Kliem sent the Aufseherin Gertrud Schulz,
who was present up to now, out of the room and said:
"Leave the room, you will not bear it any longer".
He beat me, untilj£ I fell on the floor, several
times I fainted for some moments and was always
called to conscience by his beatings. He told me,
also if I would faint he would beat me to death. •
He seized me at the hair and forced me to bend over
the chair again. During the beating the belt burptcd At
and he took a new one from a nail at the wall. He
continued to beat me and to kick me with his boots. •
After I had promised Kliem to report the person, who
gave me the parcel, if 3ae would return,he Iqt me go.
I tumbled out of the room. I had two fingers of the﻿

Ifeffibta-s-. Moreover I w%s blind on the left eye for
a fortnight and the right eye was badly affected.
Also after 8 months the marks of the beatings were
to be seen. At the beginning of November 1945
I made a statement before Capt. Alexander of J.A.G.
War Grimes, I showed him the marks of the beatings
by Kliem. Up to to-day I am suffering from loss of
memory and from headache.
Once during the beating Kliem threatened me with
a.pistol, which he pointed to my head. But as I
could only tell him the truth, he continued beating
me.
I tried to get on handsand feet out of the room, ‘
but Kliem kicked me and said, that I was exaggerating,
he forced me to tumble out. Before the house two
of my comrades assisted me to get into my hut.
The camp doctor, who was a prisoner herself, bandaged
me as well as she could with her poor means, viz.
paper bandages.
The next morning Kliem ordered that I had to go
to another working command (Arbeitskommando) viz.
to Billstr., which was the heaviest Arbeitskommando
of the camp and lay at the greatest distance. On
the way to Billstr. I was not able to walk alone
and was half carried by my comrades.
As I was not able to work,the guard, named Johannes
Mulsow, hid me in a shelter, although he was ordered
by Kliem to force me to work.
When we returned from the work in the evening I had
to go to the Kommandantur againji there I was cross-
examined by Hauptscharfuhrer Kliem^an officer from
Spaldingstr. in presence of the Aufseherin Gertrud
Schulz. Also this officer beat me several times into
the face, when I could not make any other statements.
Kliem ordered that* I should not receive any food
for 8 days.
made this statement in German, which I
perfedtly.

That same evening I visited Erna Fuchs in her
room. She was bandaged everywhere and suffered
from a light concussion of the brain, so that
one could not speak with her. She was m a very

In May 1945 I examined a patient named Erna Fuchs.
I ascertained fractures of two fingers of the lelt
hand which had set badly, contusions of the head
and bruises at the left thigh. It was clear that
this was the result of brutal treatment.
It was obvious that Fraulein Fuchs was suffering
from shock and she had slight difficulty in
speaking and thinking.
Erna Fuchs told me that her injuries were the
result of a mishandling by the Lagerfiihr er of
her Arbeitslager. I had no reason to doubt her
statement.
Erna Fuchs also complained of pains in her back
and ribs so that I thought "that she had broken
some ribs, which was not confirmed.
I have made this statement from memory as I have
lost the records of my practice during a move.

I am 22 years of age, of Czechoslovakian nationality, born at

During the time that I was at HEUGRA3EH concentration camp
I witnessed the following occurr&nce: I think it was in
December 1944 at about 5*50 in the afternoon. I cannot remember
the exaibt date.
At this time I heard a shot fired from the watch tower at
the back of the camp. I immediately went out to see what had
happened. Gustav R030LY was on guard.
I asked him what had happened and he said that ha had seen
one of the women talking to a Frenchman through the wire.
Therefore he had fired at her with his rifle.
Later on I spoke to the girl herself, whose name was Greta
MtlLLER. She told me the same thing. She had^ immediately run
away, the shot had missed her.
There was no reason why ROSOLY should have fired because thar
was no possibility of escape,the camp was guarded and the gat
was shut, apart from the £act that the |irl was no where near
the sate There was no gap in the wire through which a person
might escape. Further more it was a custom at NEGGRABEH for
the prisoners to talk to people through the wire every aY*
And this had never been interfered with before by the guards.
The people we spoke to were prisoners of war from another
camp nearby.
I am the holder ofi an English interpreter's certificate

One afternoon in December 1944 while I was a
prisoner at Neugraben concentration camp,it must
have been during the first week of the month
before I was taken to hospital, I heard a shot
fired.
A few minutes afterwards a girl named Greta
Muller came running into the room, where I
was. She was very pale and trembling with
exitement.
She told me and the other occupants of the room
that she had been speaking to somebody outside
the wire. The guard Gustav Rosoly had seen this
and ffred a shot at her.
There was no question of her trying to escape.
I have made this statement in English, which

In the winter of 1944 I think it must have been
November I was one of a squad of women from Neu-
graben concentration camp employed in digging
a ditch not far from the camp.
The weather was icy celd and there was a bitter
wind. One of the guards was Albert Riinkel.
One of the women whose name was Tieber and who
was rather elderly.attempted to find shelter,
from the wind. She went behind one of the buildings
only a few feet away from the ig place of work.
On seeing this Runkel fired his rifle at her.
I saw this with my own eyes and I can state
that he did not aim above the woman, but de-
li.TD6!r£i'b0ly	B.'t tli© woman liGXSGlf • ior’ironaosly
he did not succeed in hitting her.
Tieber was a Czechoslovakian and also had a
daughter in the same camp. She had lived in
Morawia, Znojmo. I believe she is now in Bruenn.
Runkel was a man who was feared and disliked
by his fellow guards as well as all the pri-
soners .
I have made this statement in English, which

Grimes Investigation Team, at Hamburg, on
February the 21st 1946.
I am 38 years of age, of Czechoslovakian natio-
nality, born in Brunn. At present I have no home
in Czechoslovakia. My .present address is Stade,
Holtemannstr. 7.
Shortly before the end of the war, we were
transferred from Tiefstak to Belsen. We had
to walk a certain way in order to reach
the cattletrain in which we should travel.
While we were waiting for the train, there
was an air»raid. We were ordered to sit on
the street. While we were sitting on the street
I turned round and saw the Aufseherin Herta
StjRTH beating my friend Kathe Griinwald with
her fists. The girl was beaten for approximately
5 or 10 minutes. The more the girl tried to
protect her face, the more she was beaten.
Afterwards her face was swollen and she was
bleeding from mouth and lips.
Later I spoke with Kathe Grunwald. She said
that there had been absolutely no reason for
punishment. Possibly she had laughed and
therefore roused the Aufseherin against her.
I have made this statement in German which

/
I am 55 years of age, German, born in TZSCHETZSGHNOW
nr Frankfurt/Oder. My permanent home is at HAMBURG,
Rentzelstr, 50.
Since 1927 I was a Customs official in HAMBURG. In
Sept 1944 I was detailed together with another 150
Customs officials to the duty as guardsman in Con-
centration Camp.
In the year 1937 I voluntarily joined the NSDAP.
I was first sent to NEUGRABEN, which was an working
camp of NEUENGAMME. After a short time I became Kom-
mandofuehrer.-My duty as Kommandofuehrer consisted
of supervising a small working party together v/ith
a small number of guards.-Although it was our duty
to report prisoners who behaved badly or who were
lazy or tried to escape, I have never done it. I have
hever seen any woman being punished, while I was Kom-
mandofuehrer. I have heard once that a woman cried. .
At this time I imagined that she had been beaten
by Hauptscharfuehrer KLIEM. Oh no occasion have I
punished prisoners myself.

On the 19tfo Sept 1944 I oam as a guardsman to the
KSUGBABET! Caqp. At this time tlie oanp was just in the
progress of being built. SO hum not received any
training, before we came to the Carp. It was our duty
to guard the women, when they moved to their working
place, in the morning, it «e had to prevent women from
leaving the casap and. had to see that none of them got
in touch with the outside world. However, we never
got any specific orders.
I remember that in December 1944 I fired a shot into
the air. After I had fired, a forewerfcer came and
asked me "What have you done?* I did not answer. I
have fiired, because I wanted to oiiaoe away the fo-
reign workers, who were standing at the fences, talk-
ing to the women. I cannot remember that a specific
woman had talked with a Frenchman, It was very dark,
so that I could not see properly* I could only hear
the conversation, and therefore 2 fired the shot into
the air . If I had wanted to Indicate a certain person,
I would have gone there and sent her away. Osier no
cixTOKistances I would have fired the shot. § eae
^--*
I ©ice handed in a written report, when I saw guardaaan
OTOTk chasing a woman m the working place with a stick.
Shis was in HEUGBAISL The woman wanted to go into the
hut, because it was vesy cold outside. It was his duty
to see that she was not inside the hut. I have seen that
he had beaten her csn the back, and on the 8th Nov 1945
I made the report to the Mil Gov. ‘2he guardsman was not
punished.
t
It was our- duty to make reports if the prisoners did not
want to woife or escaped. I only reported prisoners, if
it was really necessary* At thoseoccacions they were
punished by the ms® leader KUSH.

In August 1932 I joined the NSDAP. One month after I had

from the SA, because I got a treatment by a Jewish optician.
In Sept. 1944- I was transferred to the Labour Camp NEUGRABEN
as a guard. I was in charge of the working parties outside
the camp.
I have never reported prisoners to the camp Commandant at
any occasion. In a few cases, wnen the girls imisbehaved Heir-
selves, I merely shouted at them. - I have never seen any
illtre&tments, except by Hauptsoharfuehrer ICLIEIvI himself.
This used to happen in the morning, before the prisoners
inarched off to work. KLIELI and the SS-Aufseherin Gertrud
SCHULZ assembled the women in the camp for the roll-call;
while all prisoners were still present, KLIEM punished^the
women, who had been reported to him by the guards and di the
SS-Aufseherin. I witnessed it myself. I certainly can state
and saw at miyself, that Gertrud SCHULZ was present.
I was told by some other Aufseherinnen that Gertrud SCHULZ
made reoorts to the camp commandant regarding several inci-

transferred to TIEFSTAE.
At TIEISTAK I was only for 2 days,’ before we were evacuated
to BERGEN-BBLSSN. I accompanied the prisoners on this journey.
I can state that the conditions on the train were very bad,
especially due to overcrowding. As far as I can remember,
food for the prisoners was issued only twice; once at the
beginning of the journey, and once during, the journey itself. ■
When had handed over the prisoners at .BELSM, our task" was fi-

of cement slabs as those which were made by the
prisoners of the concentration camp from Fe-
bruary 6, 1945 to the transfer of the camp.
The (hollow) stone marked "exhibit F Tiefstak"
is also exactly the same kind of (hollow) stone
as those made by the prisoners of the concen-

The iron mould marked "exhibit E Tiefstak"
is a mould which was used to manufacture the
(hollow) stones marked "exhibit F Tiefstak."

Subject:- WEXLER, Hans Heinz
Attached herewith copy of a report by Gapt. D. HOHNEN ref the a/m.
2.	Capt. D. HOHNEN arrested WEXLER on 16 Jun 19^6 at GEIGANT and placed
him in 22 PoW Gamp REGENSBURG. In order to ensure that WEXLER was not released
Gapt. D. HOHNEN left with the OG of 22 PdW Gamp a War Criminal Arrest Report and
also made out an index card for the camp index filing system on which it was stated
that WEXLER was wanted by Great Britain and that he was on no account to be released
without prior reference to EtTAG B.A. O.R.
3*	Capt. D. HOHNEN then proceeded to WIESBADEN and asked Lt. Col. N. WOODBURN
to arrange extradition. The extradition was delayed for some time and eventually
when Gapt. D. HOHNEN returned to REGENSBURG on 10 Sep 194-6 he was informed that WEXLER
had been released. Further investigations produced the information contained in the
attached report.
4-	5 Region GIG at REGENSBURG is taking up this matter and is endeavouring
to trace WEXLER.
5»	ROTH, mentioned in para 3 of the attached report is being arrested by
5 Region GIG and they have undertaken to obtain information from him as to WEXLER's
whereabouts.
6.	This matter is reported to you since it seems evident that the American
authorities do not seem to be prepared to hold any War Criminals arrested by us in
the American Zone and since extradition in most cases is a somewhat lengthy process,
the investigator cannot always wait in the American Zone with the prisoner. As far
as possible Lt. Gol. N. W00IBURN does endeavour to get extradition speeded up in these
cases but for various reasons this is not always possible and then it becomes necessary
to place the prisoner in an American CIS or PoW Camp.
7.	In view of this incident and also other incidents which have come to light
in the past, would it be possible for the Provost Marshall US Zone to be asked to
circulate GIGs and PoW Gamps requesting that any prisoner placed there by British
Investigators be frozen automatically until extradited ?

REPORT BY CAPJ. D. HOHMBN
Subject;- WEXLER, Hans Heinz
Proceeded to FR.A1KFURT on 9th of Sep 46, where I ascertained from
Gapt. SCHNABEL of American Extradition that 1EXLER had been released from
22 PoW Gamp at REGENSBURG.
Proceeded to 22 PoW Camp at REGENSBURG where they confirmed this
and informed me that an American GIG Officer has authorised his release. The
reason for his erroneous release will be investigated.
Proceeded to his home village GEIGANT, at night, and made inquiries
in the Gasthaus SCHALL, his last known residence. Elicited the following
information from one Herr ROTHE:-
1.	that on Sunday 16th of Jun 1+6 a British Secret Service
Officer carne to GEIGANT, and arrested WEXLER.
2.	that after approx. 9 weeks WEXLER returned to GEIGANT
having been released by the Americans from the PoW Camp
at REGENSBURG.
3.	that he stayed two days only in GEIGANT, and having
handed over his business (wooden plates, brass, bowls etc)
to ROTHE, left for an unknown destination on his "Victoria"
motorcycle.
4.	that he, ROTHE, was the only single person who had the
slightest idea of WEXLER's whereabouts. But that he had
sworn faithfully not to reveal any information to anybody
whatsoever.
5.	that he was receiving letters for WEXLER (addressed
GEIGANT bei WALIMUEUCHEN, Gasthaus SCHALL).
6.	that he, ROTHE, is now living at WAFFENBRUENN (10 km away
from GEIGANT).
7.	that he, ROTHE, had also been in a Concentration Camp
with WEXLER.
In view of the fact that no further immediate steps to trace 1EXLER
could be taken by this investigating officer, the whole case has been handed
over to 5 Region GIG REGENSBURG. All the information contained in this report, .
together with all previous information obtained about WEXLER (description,
previous addresses etc.) has been given in full to the GIG authorities.

Subject: Hans Heinz .SUCI2R
Reference your letter BA0IV,30/2O!|/l6/A(L) of 25 Sept 46
1.	The meaning of para 3 of your above quoted letter is not
absolutely clear. WEXLER was not arrested by the Americans but
by a Haystack investigdbtj who put him into the nearest camp and
in accordance with the standing orderd proceeded immediately to
WIESBADEN where he notified Lt Col WOQDBURN and requested his ex-
tradition to be out through as quickly as possible. The orders
which Officer i/c Haystack has given to the investigators are
that when they locate or arrest an individual in the American
Sone they complete the normal forms required by the Americans
and go to WIESBADEN and contact your office in order that extra-
dition may be obtained. In sane cases they wait at WIESBADEN
until the extraditon papers have been
nsbtained and bring the prisoner back to the British Zone with
them.
2.	If the wanted person is reported as having been arrest-
ed by the Americans then application for his extradition would
be made in writing by this office or by whatever agency was con-
cerned to you through A(P34).
3.	It would seem therefore from the facts as stated by the
Haystack investigator concerned that the Americans have 110^ poss-
ible answer to our complaint when they released this man in de-
fiance of the normal procedure and -saM. definite written instructions
given to the Commandant of the Camp concerned.

Subject:- War Crimes - Hans Heinz WEX1ER.
Reference your BAOR/30/2C4/l9/A(L) dated 16 Oct 1+6.
1.	There does seem to be some misunderstanding regarding the
arrest of wanted persons in the US Zone.
2.	These are the facts of the arrest of Hans 1EXLER as reported
by Capt. HOKNEN the Haystack officer carrying out the arrest: a/n subject
was arrested in the Bavarian mountains after a prolonged search by Capt.
HOHNEN in the presence of a member of the American Police. He was then
taken to an American CIC where Capt. HOHNEN infomed the Camp Conraandant
as to his identity and put^rn his own handwriting on the American CIC file
to show that WEXLER was a war criminal and was not to be released in any
circumstances. Then Capt. HOHNEN proceeded to report to Lt. Col. WOOD BURN
at WIESBADEN and gave him all the necessary information asking him to obtain
the necessary clearance for extradition.
3.	You will no doubt agree that if the US Authorities released
the a/n subject after this procedure it was entirely their fault.
4.	As to the avoidance of such occurrences in the future you suggest
that more explicit information should be given to your Detachment to obtain
a clearance. A letter has been sent to Haystack for distribution amongst
all officers concerned instructing them to include in their information the
details set out by you in para 4 of your letter.
k	Your suggestion in para 2 of your letter that the actual arrest
should be carried out by the US Authorities and not by Haystack officers is
entirely new as so far all arrests in the American Zone have been carried
out by British officers and the Americans have been notified as soon as an
arrest was effected. The same applies to American officers arresting war
criminals in the British Zone. The OC Haystack infccnns this office that
any other procedure would be impractical as the Americans have not got the
necessary forces available to send an American officer or NCO with
British investigator to effect an arrest.
6	If the US Authorities are, as you say in your letter, most insis-
tent that this should be done this would constitute deviation from the
procedure which was agreed upon and which has_always been adhered to so far
and would have to be the subject of a new policy decision.

On the 16th of June 1946 this unit has been notified by the
0/C HAYSTACK that Hans W13QLM, Lageraltester in HANnOYlH -
awt,KM Casap was arrested and put into custody at B.B.F.C. 22
U.S. Zone. Lt.Ool. WOOBBUBB has been asked for his extradi-
tion.
On the 19th of June 1946 this unit approached your Branch
to make the necessary steps for the extradition of Hans
WEXLEE and for his transfer to TOMATO. So far no answer was
received from your Branch. In view of the fact that the in-
vestigation of HAHHOVEE-AHLEM case is completed and the fi-
nal report could be submitted to your Branch, it would be
appreciated if this unit could be informed when Hans WBXLER
will be transferred to the British Zone.
It would be appreciated if this case could be treated as an
urgent one.

It was a condition of entry into Kripp service that the appli-
cant should have performed some military service. Accordingly
TOED volunteered in MAR 37 f'0*' a 2 months course with Flakreg,
9 in LIEPSTADT and did a similar course in SEP 38 mth the A.A,
in DUSSELDORP.
War-time./•	'	M
In AUG" 39 Sub ject- was called up to Res. Flak Bait 642 in MDRS.
where he held the rank of Uffz. After a few months service
’ however> without warning, he was claimed by Kripo DUSSELDORJ?
' and discharged from the Amy,
On renorting to his Chief in DUSSBLDORF he v/as ordered to join
a special course at the Sipo School, BERLIN, The order had
Come from above. The Chief himself was completely in the dark,
SIPO COURSE APR-JIM 43.
On arrival Y.TED found the course already in progress. There
v/ere 36 students, all police officials from Kripo, Stapo or
SD, Mt IIl(SD) of the RSHA was the responsible authority.
Nobody seemed to"know the purpose of the course, instruction
amounted to no more than 3 °r V Hrs a week. Sub j ects included
'most European languages, photography, cypher and history. In
• charge of the course was Krim, Eat BENNER*
TOED cannot say how ho came to. bo chosen for this SD course un-
less it was a result of his creditable performance at the ear-
lier course, In any. case he had no desire to be transferred
to SD which seemed to be the object.
» k
After several weeks TOED became so wreary of this inactivity tnat
ho arranged -with a Major von HXPPEL of the Lehrregiment BRANDEN-
BURG to be called up to that formation. Von HIEPEL apparently
had considerable- authority and was able to ’engineer1 the call
up at such short notice via the QKW direct that the SD had no
time to apply for a deferment.
LEHERECIMENT BRANDENBURG z,b.V 800.
This unit of approx, batallion-strength was located in BRANDEN-
BURG, TOED arrived towards the end of JUN 4® and was_attached
to the Stabs Kompanie with the rank of Feldw. The unit appar-
ently existed for the purpose of training troops for special
missions. Such missions had been carried out during"the cam-
paign against FRANCE: and the NETHERLANDS,

In SEP 41, however, after barely 3 months aervico, WIED vaa again
recalled to the Kripo. The Sipo had persuaded the COT to release
all Sip.o, personnel, serving in the Wehrmacht so far as they were
not officers.
Back at Kripo Leitstello D^SSELDORF he resumed hi& former office
as head of the Dept. Fraud, until APR 42 when he was posted to
'the RSHA.
RSHA BERLIN
Here Y/IED was employed in Ant V.GIIb. which conducted investi-
gations into corruption arising in tho Forces, public authorities
and SS. The volume of work soorf assumed such proportions that
the dept, had to be split up into sections. Y/TED took charge of
the section Luftwaffe corruption. This division was not rigid,
however, and all personnel were liable to be loaned out to any
other section, 'as required. (For set-up see App. ’A').
small oases of corruption the local Kripo was. authorised to
handle the.investigations reporting progress and results to Amt
V.Wi 2a. In cases of wider significance, operations were con-
ducted entirely from this office. WIED has mentioned the follow-
ing cases :-

Wps investigations in LUBLIN established that 18. S3' men, rnaihly.
on the ’Bokleidungswork’ staff, v/ere guilty of corruption on a
large scalo. Throughout his enquiries WIED had to combat delib-
erate obstruction from the higher Stapo leaders because they them-
selves were also deeply implicated., For example, the a/m ALPERS
intervened on behalf of one of the accused S3 men in whose possess-
ion WIED had found a large quantity of obviously stolen jewellery
and clothing etc in that he declared that the accused had taken
the articles vdth the authority of 'Stiftung'.
The cases against the 18 accused were heard before the S3 u. Poliz-
eigericht KASSEL. Sentences up to 3 years imprisonment were im-
posed but in several cases no verdict could be reached since the
defendants were absent allegedly on front-line service.
The resentment against. WIED1s interference in-this profitable
'racket* in LUBLIN found expression'in a variety of ways. On one
occasion he found the tyres of his car slashed, on another occass-
ion there was sugar in the petrol-tank.

Corruption in Kz ORANIlNBimG. In 1942 SS Gruf. KALTENBRUMER received
"an anonymous letter accusing S3 personnel of stealing food rations
intended for the internees of the a/m Kz* He refored the matter to
the then Chief of Kripo, SS Gruf NEBE. Before instituting investi-
gations NEBE deemed it advisable to inform SS Ogruf POHL, who, as
head of the Wirtschaftsverwaltungsstelle, -was responsible for all Kzs.
POHL had great influence with. HMMLER. NEBE was shrewd enough to re-
alise that if on investigation the charges were proven and made public
he would antagonise POHL who,
avenge his.is elf«
having HIMMLER’S ear, could readily
NEBE' entrusted Subject, wdth the case but exprossly ordered him to en-
sure that the investigations came to nothing as he did not wish
1HMMLER- to hear of corruption in the SS. On WED* S protestations NEBE
agreed to add his signature to the final report.
Chief amdhgst the accused was the Kormandant of Ks ORANIENBNRG him-
self, SS Ob erf. LORITZ. He was suspected of -vrorking the prisoners
for his ovai profit and appropriating a variety of goods for his own
■uso. The extravagant luxury of his-suite in the Kz indicated that
the charges wore not without foundation. Nevertheless, Subject had
to produce a'negative result as ordered, which duly received NEBE’s
signature and was laid before' ILLIMLER to prove that everything was
clean and above board in' the Camp.
TOED states that when he pointed out to NEBE the danger of such dup- ■
licity the latter took the precaution of appending a statement to the
effect that he had acted on POHL's, i.e, his superior's orders*
SONDER KOMMLSSION in Kz ORANIENBHRG. In spite of the _warning, corr-
uption in the a/m camp grew to such proportions that in 1943 a spec-
ial commission headed by Ostuf. OORNELY was■sent there to investigate.
Ostubaf KAINQL, successor to LORITZ as Kommandant obstructed CORNELY
wherever possible. Prisoners chosen by -OORNELY to give evidence of
theft, brutality and murder against the Gamp staff were transferred to
other camps*

S. was Kornmandant of the Kz for women at RAVMSBRUCK near DEEtUN.
42.	Kripo - SS Relations. Both Ogruf POHL and his legal officer, Ostubaf
; SdEUPT-KLEWENOW resented the employment. of Kripo in the investigat-
ion of SS matters and were of the opinion that the SS should wash
their own dirty washing in privacy.
43*	Murder Camp LUBLIN. In the course of his investigations' into corrup-
tion in LUBLIN TOED also saw something of the Camp where Jews were
exterminated. The Kz was some 6 KM from the town of LUBLIN.
Attached to the Kz was a crematorium which 'TOED personally visited, '
It was a single storey building containing the mortuary, about 6
ovens and the living quarters of the attendant, Oscharf. MUSEELD.
TOth the wind.in the right direction the stench in LUBLLN 6 Km dis-
,. tant was nauseating. Apparently the victims wore mainly delivered
by truck, executed — 7/IED believes by shooting - and then cremated. •
TORTH .and HERING (See para. 25) pl^ped^^prominent part in the kill-
ings and openly boasted of it. .//SGIOTTt'ram whomTOED has this in-
formation, had heard them,
-	f' .-V - ' v. J -4 ■	.	- •	.
TOED states that an Ostuf. DOMNIK, who had charge of LUBLIN town
.prison which W. has visited, had (on one occasion) the task of sel-
ecting some 200 of his prisoners for execution as reprisal for the
shooting of a fey/ Germans by partisans.
46,	...	On four or five occasions during his stay in LUBLIN W. saw a Stand-
artenf, BLOBEL who came to visit the Kcranandeur der Sipo, Stubaf.Dr.
FUEFZ. It appears that B. had an independant commission from BERLIN
oqliterate all traces of these atrocities over a very large area
in the East. The Crematoria would come under Inis authority."
47.	Other persons who, in TOs opinion, must take responsibility for these
murders are :-
Ostuf. TMUMANN. -	-	-	—	-	Schutzhaftlagcrfuelirer.

1$.	Obstractionists. The staff of the DelcloidungSTOrk LUBLIN same under
the ooramand of the S3 Standortlcommandant, Stubaf WIPPERN. This man
showed no' inclination to support W. in his investigations the probable
■ reason being that he was too deeply involved in corruption himself.
There was no check or record of property removed from prisoners. It
was obvious fran the lavish spending and extravagant living of the
staff of both Kz and Bekleidungsvrerk that this must be their souroo
of ..income.
49,	In BERLIN considerable opposition ©specially at the'time of*tho
special commissions investigations in Kz ORANIENBURG was encountered
frpm Gruf. GLUECKS, who with POHL (para. 35) was in command of all
Kzs. He, in ¥*s opinion must also be held responsible for the
crimes committed in these camps.
5®.	Ober Reg Rat ALPERS (para, 25) also did his utmost to impede Subjects
inquiries. Eor example as a result of a house search at the homes
of a Stuscharf. ROTTENMJSSER and another S3 Man, both in the town
. of DACHAU, W. discovered a quantity of property stolen from prison-
ers* ALPERS, probably-prompted by Stubaf. WIRTH (para. 25), shielded
the thieves by officially stating that they load the permission of his
organization, 'Die gemeinnuetzige Stiftung fuer Ansdaltspflege* to
take the goods.
51,	A later special investigation Commission sent to LUBLIN and headed
by Hstuf,'DENNERLEIN to Investigate suspicions against the SD in
LUBLIN encountered similar obstruction. DENNERLEIN or his assistants
STUTKA and COHNEN, if available should be able to givo a full account.

conducted investigations in Kz. AUSCHWITZ had similar experiences,

These records consisted in :~

54,	They also kept records of the findings of their special Commissions
which had worked In the Kzs LUBLIN, ORANIENBURG, AUSCHWITZ, BUCHEN-

55,	The originals of all documents were forwarded, to the SS u. Polizeige-
richt KASSEL which had a special department dealing vd-th^corruption,
murder and maltreatment of prisoners headed by Ogruf. Prinz zu
WALDECK. Probably in 1943 this court, moved to MUNICH and later to
PRIEN am Chiemsee. Chief case officer was Ostubaf.' MITTELSTAEDT. In
W's opinion this court's records should still bo in existence.

TR/iNSLATION OP DEPOSITION
of
Dawid IIPK/'v.
Deposition on oath of Damd LipKa, male, - of Jewish Gawp' No. 116, Hannover-
Vinnhorst, sworn before me, Capt, William Richard Durndell, East Surrey liegt*,
of No. 2 War Crime Investigation -Team, at Hanover, on the 5 March 1946.
I am 23 years of age, Polish subject, born at Rypin (Poland) 18/5/2,5. On the
29 September 1944 I was deported from the ghetto of Lodz to the concentration
camp at ...xuschwitz, .After about three weeks tnere, I was taken for working to
the concentration camp at Hanover-Stocken, where I worked at the factory
called ''Continental". After about ten days of our stay there, there arrived
a group of ten "Kappa", amongst'whom was'Hans OLSCHEWSKI. ■ In December 1944,
the whole camp of Stocken moved to Ahlem where; I worked under the command of
"Kapo" OLSCHEWSKI.
On the.first day after our arrival at Ahlem, OLSCHEWSKI announced to his
group of prisoners (ten persons):— "Even if Germany should lose this war,
none of you iri.ll leave here alive} I shall finish you off before this happens.
I shall not let your vengeance overtake me." Each day after this OLSCHEWSKI
ordered each of his group of ten to bend ovef a stool, and hcj, then delivered
each of us ten strokes on the buttocks with a rubber cdsh.
Every week OLSCHEWSKI took away our three days ration of bread, which he
subsequently sold to the German foremen for cigarettes, watches, etc. One day
in January '45, OLSCHEWSKI -took away our whole day food ration, maintaining
that we did not deserve any food at all, for we had not worked; this'was quite
false, for we had done more work that day, than usual. One of our group, by
the name of CYTRYNQWICZ, 33 years of age, reported this to the'Camp COMMANDANT.
For this, OLSCHEv/SKI, on the same evening took CYTRYNOWICZ to the washhouse,
where he beat him up, and then gave him an injection, apparently of petrol,
after which CYTRYNCWICZ died. I myself did not witness this beating, but I
heard CYTRYNOWTCZ/s cries, being-myself -in the adjoining compartment} on the
next day, I saw OYTRYNDWICZ1 s corpse in a container, in which corpses were
deposited. Later on, CYTRYNOWICZ's corpse was taken away in a motor-lorry to
a crematorium. After our liberation, I saw the urn with CYTRYNOWICZ's ashes ‘
in the Jewish Committee.
On another day in January, a prisoner, Vigdor JAKUBOWICZ, received a
premium of 5 cigarettes for good work. On the same evening, OLSCHEWSKE
demanded these cigarettes, .When JAKUEOWICZ refused, OLSCHEWSKI beat him up
with an iron bar to this extent, that JAKUBOWICZ died shortly after. This
happened at about 10 p.m. JAKUBCWTCZ1s corpse remained until morning on the
bunk, and was then removed by myself to the container for corpses. I myself
witnessed the whole of the above scene, i,e. demanding the cigarettes and
killing ox JAKUBOWICZ by OLSCHEWSKI, because it happened in our common room,
and JAKUBOWICZ's bunk adjoined to mine.
One day, in^Februaiy 45, during the roll-call, OLSCHEWSKI said to an /
SS-man (l heard it myself):- "I cannot eat my- breakfast in peace, unless I
have killed five or six prisoners. I can kill them with one blow,"
Immediately afterwards I saw that OLSCHEWSKI went up to a prisoner named
BAGNO, aged 35, and struck him so strongly that BAGNO died on the spot. The
prisoners in the camp were so emaciated that .often a blow or a kick caused
death. Besides, OLSCHEWSKI wore on his fingers knuckle-dusters. Thereupon,
OLSCHEWSKI went up to a prisoner named Lezor NAJMAN, aged 55, and struck him
several times (l could not see in what part of the body), after which NAJMAN
fell to the ground. After the roll-call NAJMAN wag taken to the Infirmary,
where he died several hours later.﻿-2— ■
Towards the end of February or in the beginning of March '45, when we
worked in a quarry, OLSCHS'.fSKE ordered a prisoner naned FPiEIDENIffilCH to
place his leg under the wheels of the running trolley trucK; otherwise, he
threatened FKEIDENKEICH with death. ,.FEEID311BEICH placed his leg under the
trolley wheels, and had his leg broken. I myself saw this. When
OLSCHETtSKI saw the lying FREIDEffiLEICH, he said with a sadistic laugh:-
You are a fool, then I tell you to put you^ leg on the rails, you do it.
Therefore you are a fool. " FKEIDFNIiEICH was then toicen to the Infirmary,
where he died after a week because of shortage of. medical dressings.
In January '45, I worked under C.ldCHRi‘SKI on night' shift. When once,
at dawn, I interrupted my work because I was exaau,sted (oh the previous
day we did not receive-any food), OLiSCHEWSKI came'up to me and said that I
had done no woric during that night, whereupon he'told me to hold up my
handj when I did so, OLSCHEWSKL struck me so strongly with a rubber cosh,
that my sidn split and I began bleeding badly. Then I was taken to the
Imirmary, ..here Dr. iFajwlowicz stitched my wound; I still have the scars
on my tend.

accused hin of not working hard enough, When OEG-LA replied that he had
worked hard enough, OLSCHEWSKI tore a spade out of his hand, and struck hin
several tines on the head, shoulders and back. Y/hon CEGLA fell down to
the ground, OLSCHEWSKI began kicking hin with his feet. OISCHEWSKI
forbade anybody to help CBGLA. CEGLA lay, dying, until about 4 o'clock
in the morning, when, assisted by three other prisoners, I took him, still
alive, to the Infirmary. The same day, I saw CEGLA's corpse lying in the
corpse container.
At the end of January 1945, when I was returning fron work, OLSCHEWSKI,

I an 20 years of ago, Polish subject, born at Lodz, on 30/6/26.
On the 7 Septcnber 1944 we were taken by transport fron Auschwitz to
the canp at Stocken near Hanover. After throe weeks of our stay at
Stocken, there cane to the canp 10 Gornan "Kapos" fron the canp of
Neuganne by Hanburg. Anongst these there was. one "Kapo" Hans
OLSCHEASKI, nicknaned "Raczka" ("Hand" - because he had a bandaged
hand). Kapo OLSCHEVSKI began his activities in a bestial way, because
he boat up prisoners until they bled and ■became unconscious, -.i/hen they
could not perform their tasks. Until the 1 December '44 we worked in
a rubber factory "Continental". All "Kapos" had rubber coshes, which
they used for beating prisoners on the head and face. Several tines
"Kapo" 0IS0HBWSKI beat no up with a rubber cosh on the head and on the
face, whilst I worked at the "Schlauchabteilung" Department_under him
for a week. Towards the end of January 1945 or at the beginning of
Preburary ’45 we worked constructing an ammunition underground factory
at Ahlem. One night I saw "Kapo" OISCHEUSKI go up to a prisoner,
named CEGLA, age 45, and because CEGLA could not work fast enough,
snatched the shovel fron his hand, and began beating him on the head
with it. After several strokes, CEGIk. fell to the ground, bleeding
fron the mouth. When CEGLA lay on the ground, 0L3CHSWSKI began to
kick him on tho chest and stomach; CEGLA began giving the death-rattle,
and begged OLSCHEwSKE to leave him alone. OLSCHE'WSKI, however, took
no notice of his begging and carried on kicking him, laughing at the sane
time and saying to no and to tho people around:- "Such will be the end 01
all you, Polish Jews."	CEGLA lay on the ground half-dead until morning,
for OLSCHEWSKI would not allow any of us to touch him. In the morning
four prisoners dragged GEGLA, who in the meantime had died, to the
Infiraary; in the Infirmary CEGLA was stripped naked, and put into a
paper bag, which was thrown into a concrete container for corpses.
After several days, CEGLA's corpse was taken by a motor-lorry to a
crematorium in Hanover, Podbiolski street (to tho boat of my knowledge).

No.42, at 8 Ohestrasse, Hanover, sworn before me, Oapt. William Riohard
Durndell, East Surrey Regt.of No.2 War Crime Investigation Team, at
Hanover, on the 7 March 194o0
I am 3"! years of age, Polish subject, born at Lodz on 15 July
On the 28 August 1944, I was deported from the Lodz ghetto to the
concentration carq? at Auschwitz, from which, after several days, a group
of about a thousand Lodz Jews was taken to Hanover-Stcckon. Etcm
Stocken I was transported, on the i December 19A4, to tho camp at Ahlem.
In the camp of Stocken, as well as in Ahlem, I performed the duties of
the camp doctor; my duty consisted of receiving the.sick and looming
after those sick in the Infirmary, During my stay in both camps, many
prisoners came to me, who had been beaten up by "Kapos”; I always asked
them by whom they had keen beaten; many of them told me that they had
been beaten by a "Kapo" Hans OLSCBEWSKI. I remember two cases, who
reported to me with their arms broken by OLSCHEWSKI.
Towards the end of January or at the beginning of February 45
(at the Ahlem camp), a badly beaten prisoner by the name of Jezef WAKS
was brought to me, I then saw that he had heavy injuries to the head,
the chest, and especially around the heart; injuries issre caused by ^
being kicked by feet. WANS told me that he had been kicked by
OLSCHEWSKI. I took WAKS into the Infinmry, but, owing to the lack of
2KS supplies, he liel scveusl days after, I can state tog****
that WAKS1s death was caused by the beating he received from OLSCHEWSKI.
The fact that WAKS had been beaten by OLSCHEWSKI.was confirmed to me
later by- WAKS’s two sons, who witnessed the incident.
At the same time, another prisoner by the name of
was brought to me. He had bruised wounds on the head, and his ^ht y
had beendestroyed. The beating had resulted.m an enormous swelling
of the head. After several days of his stay in the Infirmary, xJ 1
died Before he died, PINSKIER himself stated that he had been beaten
wiJh a wooden sSck by’"Kapo" OLSCHEWSKI; this was confirmed to me by
PINSKIER's colleagues, who had witnessed the incident.

Crimes Investigation Unit, DAOR, at Esterwegen, on the 13th March 1946.
I am 39 years of age, German, horn in Lffbeck on the 2k-th May 1906.
Prom 20th November 1940 till 9th December 1940 I worked in the slaughter-
house at L-abeck. I was arrested on 9th December 1940, sentenced and sent
to Lager 1, Bttgemoor. The reason for ny arrest was theft.	I remained
in Dfigermoor until Jan 19^ and was then sent to Neuengamme.	As a Kapo
I was transferred from Neuengamme to the Concentration Camp at Hannoveiv
Stficken. After abouttwo months the whole camp moved to Ahlem.
I admit that I hit two or three prisoners with my hand for stealing.
I wore the Kapo armband at Hannover-Stficken for about the first eight days.
It was taken off me because I was friendly to the jews. I never carried
a rubber truncheon as only the first Kapo was allowed to do so. I know
that prisoners were beaten by the first Kapo on the rollcall square. I
cannot remember the name of the first Kapo. I don't know how many people
died in the camp, as I never saw them. I can give no further information
about the camp at Ahlem.	(signed) Hons OlschewsfcL.

East Surrey kogtv, of No. 2 war Orioo Investigation Team, at Hanover, on
the 7 March 192f6.
I an 40 years of age, Polish subject, born at Lodz (Poland) on
19 November 1906,
On the 14 August 1914 I was taken from the Lodz ghetto to the con-
centration camp at Auschwitz* from whence, after three weeks, I was
transported to the camp at Hanover-Noi-dhafen (Stocken). In November or
at the beginning of December I was taken to the camp at Ahlem,
After several days of my stay at Nordhafen (Stocken) there came to the
camp a group of "Kapos" , amongst whoa was Ludwig KNOKR (nicknamed xn the
camp 'Wiener Kapo" or Seppel).
I myself was a witness of a murder committed by KNOKR.
Y/hen, at the beginning of January 1945, a transport of potatoes^and
carrots was brought to the Ahlem camp, a prisoner named IKGEkOWICZ pxeked
up from the ground some carrots. When KNORR saw this, he struck	_
AJGEROWICZ several tines with his fist on the stomach. When nJGERCU-
fell to the ground, KNORR gripped by the nook, and then dragged him to the
washouse. I followed then into the washouso. I then saw that KNORR
struck AJGEROWICZ with a wooden stool, until ho fell to the ground
bleeding, KNORR then notioed that I was in the washouseand ordered
me to leave immediately; I loft, but went into the adjoining toilet^,
leaving the door ajar. . I then saw KNORR, assisted by another Kapo
"Fred", hang AJGEROWICZ. It happened as follows: along the ceiling of
the washouse ran a pipe, thick as a man's am; ‘from this pipe hung
several nooses prepared since the first day of our arrival, made of thin
steel wire (from the "Continental" factory). Under the pipe there was
a table and a stool. When AJGEROWICZ was lying on the ground half-dead,
KNORR picked him up, by gripping his clothes near the chest surid standing
him on the stool, slipped the noose around his neck.	AJGEROWICZ was
alive then, for I saw his head moving. Then KNORR, assisted by Fred
(each gripping a log of d;ho stool) pulled it away from under AJGEROWIOZ s
feet, who then hung on the noose. Then "Fred" cut the wire, on which
AJGEROWICZ was hanged. Subsequently, AJGEROWICZ's corpse was remove
from the washouse by the Infirmary Orderly by the name of Pass (.also a
Jewish prisoner)
On the 2 April 1945 I was myself beaten up by KNORR, ^^lem
camp I picked up a bottle from the ground. When KNOHR saw this he
struck me on the stomach with his fist, but I ran away to the block. He
followed me, and in the block he beat me on tho head with a wooden stool
until I lost oonsoienoe. In beating me, KNOBS was assisted by N 1
OLSCHEWSKI, who used a rubber cable with wire inside. ooar
wema I still carry on ny head.	^

I am KOCHANSKI LaJle,born 28.12.1904- at Loclz/Poland and a Polish subject. On the
28.8.1944- I was taken to;:ethcr with all the other Jove from the ghetto of
Lodz to the concentration camp at Auschwitz. On the 7.9.1944 I was sent to
the concentration camp at Stockcn, and at the end of November 1944 I was
transported with the first group of prisoners to the KZL. At Ahlem.
In our camp at Ahlem was a "Kapo" Ludwig; he ms generally called "Wiener".
One night in December 1944 when I was working in a tunnel (underground installa-
tions)"! overheard a conversation between the Oberneister and Kapo Ludwig when
the Oberneister said that german workers were better than prisoners and one
german worker did more in 6 hours than a prisoner in 12 hours.
As a result of these words Kapo Ludwig threw himself on a prisoner and boat him
with his hands on the heart and stomach and later kicked him with his feet.
At the end Kapo Ludwig beat him so severely with the stick of a spade,.that the
prisoner fell on the ground and fainted. Then Kapo Ludwig stood with his feet
on the stomach of the prisoner and jumped several times. After work 4 other
prisoners brought the still unconscious prisoner to the camp-hospital, where
he died still on the same day. I do not remember the name of the murdered.

8 Ohestrasse, Hanover, sworn before me, Capt. William Richard Dumdell,
East Surrey Regt., of No.2 War Crime Investigation Team, at Hanover, on
the 7 Mar 1946.
I am 45 years of age, Polish subject, born at Lodz 8 January 1901.
On the 28 August 1944, I was taken from the Lodz ghetto to Ausohvitz,
whence, about the 10 September 1944, a large group of Jews (1020 persons)
were taken to Hanover-Nordhafen (stocken). At the beginning of December
'44 we were taken to the camp at Ahlem.
"Kono" Ludwig KNORR alias Seppel (whom we nicknamed in the camp
"Yfiener Kapo"), I first met in the camp at Nordhafen. I do not remember
the name of KNORR's.first victim. He was a Polish Jew, who had a figh
with another Jewish prisoner about potatoes, and. he injured, him.
came up to the assailant, and beat him up with a rubber cosh until he
fell to the ground. Then MORR dragged him to the wash-house, and the
next day the Jew was found dead. KNORR said later on that the Jew had
hanged himself. I saw the beating which took place in the open, ^ not
that inside the wash-house. This incident took place towards the end. of
November ’44. I saw every day in the camp at llordhafen, £S well as^
Ahlem, that KNORR made prisoners stand to attention, and. bea
^.r^rTunAnAious. I have not aeon KNOKR kill anybody, myaelf,
because he did it secretly: either in the wash-house at Nordhafen, or
in the pit, fined with wlter about 6 metres deep, in the quarry at Ahlem.
Whenever a prisoner had to go ’with KNORR to one of these P1^® ’	, ^
generally known that he would be found dead the next day. ^evera^ ho
ffter a man had been drowned, KNOER ordered his body to be dragged ^
prisoners. I myself on nw occasions have helped to crag out corpses.

Deposition on oath of Ludwig KNOKR, male, of 101 C.I.C. at Eeterwegen,
sworn hefore me, Oapt. William Richard Durndell, East Surrey Regt,, of t/ar
Grimes Investigation Unit, BAOR at Esterwegen, on the 13 March 1946.
I am 50 years of age, Austrian, horn in Vienna on 14 April 1896.
On 13th June 1938 I entered the Concentration Camp Dachau as a prisoner*
In August 1938 I v/as transferred from Dachau to Matthausen as a quarzy
worker. I remained there until 1940. I attempted escape from Matthausen,
vias shot at three times and through loss of blood was recaptured after two
days. In the same year I was sent hack to Dachau. I was taken to_Bad _
Ischl in 1941 to work on the construction of a camp there. I remained m
Bad Ischl 11 months. I returned to Dachau and was immediately sent to
S'Hertogenhosch in Holland where, as an internee, I worked on crashed
planes. In 1944 I lef't S'Hertogenhosch for Sachsehhausen where I remained
a few days. Prom there I went to the Heinkel Works where I worked 7 weeks.
Then I was taken to Neuengamme. Towards the end of 1944 I was transferred
as a Kapo from Neuengamme to Hannover-Stocken.
In 1945 some internees attacked a horse waggon loaded with carrots.
I pulled one of these prisoners hack and slapped him in the face, so that
he fell to the ground. I then went away and the prisoner got up again.
In January 1945 I slapped an internee in the face because he wanted to
drink the water in the Asphalt works at Ahlem.
I cannot remember that anybody was ever hanged in the camp. As far
as I know, nobody in the canp died through heating or ill-treatment.
I once saw SS-man DAMMANN hit a Kapo. I maintain that the whole time I
spent in Stocken and Ahlem I never saw other prisoners beaten.

We are trying to locate the
a.m, subject who was arrested on June 4th 1945
and is detained on behalf of the French authori-
ties .
In Esterwegen one of our French
officers heard that KNORR had been transferred
to Hannover on 7.5.46. He found trace of his
passage in the prison of Hannover but saw in the
records that he had been released by an English
officer on 28.5.46,
Could you possibly help us to
find where this man is actually J-oe^ted ?

The above man was lodged in P.W.E. 22 REGENSBURG- by Capt
HOHNEN on 16 June	He has now been cleared by War Grimes Branch
and, while his location has not been confirmed by the Theatre Provost
Marshal, I feel sure that in view of /this recent arrest it would be
safe to send an escort for him now, if he is urgently wanted.

At the request of JAG- I have obtained a speedy clearance of
the above man. This clearance has not included the checking of his
location but as HAG inform me that he was placed in Camp 22 on 16 Jun
by one of HAYSTACK's investigators I think that it is worth sending an
escort for him now without waiting for confirmation, if he is really
urgently wanted.

FACTS:
1.	The facts in this case are adequately summarised by A/^JAG in his minute
of advice (Flag "A") and I do not think I need enlarge upon them.
2.	A/DJAG advises that the proceedings are legally in order for confirmation
and that accused’s petition (Flag "B") does not disclose any reason for
interfering with either finding or sentence.
OBSERVATIONS:
3.	This is a straightforward case and there was ample evidence before the
court to support the conviction.
4.	I therefore recommend that you confirm the sentence.
5.	If you agree, will you please write the word "confirmed" over your
initials“in coin (b) of page 2 of AFA4 (Flag "C"), complete page 3^
of AFA4 (Flag "D") where marked and sign the Death Warrant (Flag "E").

To the Military Government Court
Brunswick
On June 18th 1916 I was sentenced by the General Military Court
in Brunswick to death by hanging,pretended for having hung a“ Jew
in the AHLEM Concentration Camp.An official counsel was given to me
on my trial,who's name and adress I don't know.(I think Dr.Borgs)
He has my Charge-Sheet.which I would like to have in my possession).
I beg the High Court to give me this counsel's name and adresato
get my Charge-Sheet from him.
I gave a new statement 3 weeks ago to an English officer
of the Military Court.If I should get a new trial I beg to give me
another counsel.
I request once more for review of my sentence because I don’t
feel guilty for murder.
Most respectfully

Prom OLSCHMSKI, Hans.
To i British Military Court in Brunswick.
In a war crimes trial from 21 until 25 June
46 I was sentenced to imprisonment for life-time, for ill
treatment of Jews who were said to have died in
consequence. I have denied these facts and have offered
to name witnesses who were able to give evidence of ny
behaviour towards the Jews in a contrary way and who could
prove that the statements of the witnesses were false.
It was refused to hear the witnesses. Besides there were
many contradictions in the statements of the witnesses. I
request if possible review of ny case or to alter ny
sentence to a limited term.

Beference your letter BA05y30/2(X:/l6/.A(L) of 25 Sept 46
1.	ihe meaning of para 3 of your above quoted letter is not
absolutely clear* W1XLSR was not arrested by the Americans but
by a Haystack investiga^f who put him into the nearest camp and
in accordance with the standing orders, proceeded immediately to
WIB&BADM where h© notified Lt Col WOCDBUHEf and requested his ex-
tradition to be put through as quickly as possible. The orders
which Officer i/c Haystack has given to the investigators are
that when they locate or arrest an individual in the American
Zone they complete the nomal forms required by the Americans
and go to WIESBADM and contact your office in order that extra-
dition may be obtained. In sesae cases they wait at WIESMD1H
until the extradition papers have been
ditetained and bring the prisoner bade to the British Zone with
them.
2.	If the wanted person is reported as having been arrest-
ed by the Americans then application for his extradition would
be made in writing by this office or by whatever agency was con-
cerned to you through A(BS4).
3.	It would seen therefor® from the facts as stated by the
Haystack investigator concerned that the Americans have no^ poss-
ible answer to our complaint when they released this man in de-
fiance of the nomal procedure and all definite written instructions
given to the CosaBaadast of the Cacrp concerned.

1.	There ae&.is sane misunderstanding re^rding the arrest of
mnted oersons in the U.8. Zone.
2.	The procedure, upon vdiich the U.S, authorities are most
insistent, is that v?hen an Investigator wishes to have anyone arrested
, he should contact the nearest Detachment of the Oounter Intelligence
Corps or Military Police or the r>ublie Safety Officer, and arrange for
the arrest to be carried out by them.
3.	Whilst it is agreed that the fault in the case in question lays
entirely with the U.S. authorities, it is considered that early information
regarding the arrest would enable this Detachment to nojrify -ar Crimes
Group of the location of the arrested man and ensure that he remains
frozen until clearance for extradition has been obtained. It is immaterial
whether the facts are transmitted to this Detachment by Mail, T.P.IvU or
telephone or by word of mouth, the main essential being speed, but written
confirmation is valuable and. should be given in all cases,
4.	In many cases also insufficient information is given to enable
hhi a Detachment to obtain clearance. Whenever ’->ossible the following
details should be given s-
a/ Bank
b/Unit
c/ Date of birth or age
a/ Brief description,

Seference your B1.' I?/30/204/19/A(i ) dated 16 Oct 46.
1,	There does seem to be schsss misun&efrstandlng regai-ding the
arrest of Y/antcd persons in the US Zone.
2.	These are the facts of the arrest of Hans WEXIER as reported
by Capt. H0HI5E1I the Haystack officer carrying out the arrest: a/n subject
was arrested in the Bavarian mountains after a prolonged search by Capt.
wshbw in the presence of a mcSbev of the American Polioe. He was then
Gn to an Arrerican CIC where Capt. HCKMBN informed the Cittrp Coamndcnt
as to his identity and patytSn&s cram haads/riting on the American CIC file
to show that 1EXLER was a war criminal and was not to be released in any
circumstances. Then Capt. IIOHKEK proceeded to report to Lt. Col. TTCDBUI®
at WU'ISE'ESJ and gave him all the necessary information asking him to obtain
the necessary clearance for extradition.
3.	you will no doubt agree that if the US Authorities released
the tt/n subject after this procedure it was entirely their fault
4,	As to the avoidance of such occurrences in the future you suggest
that more explicit information should be given to your Detachment to obtain
a clearance. A letter has been sent to Haystack for distribution amongst
all officers concerned instructing them to include in their information the
details set out by you in para 4 of your letter.
•5	Your suggestion in para 2 of your letter that the actual^arrest
should be carried out by the IS Authorities and not by Haystack officers is
entirely new as so far all arrests in the America® Zone have been carried
out by British officers and the Americans have been notified as soon as an
arrest was effected. The sane applies to American officers arresting war
criminals in the British Zone. The 00 Haystack informs this office that
any other procedure would be impractical as the Americans have not got t^
necessary forces available to serf, an American officer or liCO with menj
British investigator to effect an arrest.
6#	If the IB Authorities are, as you say in^your letter, rest insis-
tent that this should be done this would constitute .'deviation from the
procedure which ms agreed upon and which has always been adhered ho -o f <_r
and would have to be the subject of a new policy decision.

concentration camp staff in violation of the laws and usages of war were
concerned in the killing and illtreatment of Allied nationals interned in
concentration camps.
2.	It is understood that both the accused are in custody at No.8
Civilian Internment Camp, 'W-VW44.	w
iU	.......
3.	The accused should be attached to a unit and the commanding
officer should sign the charge sheet as such in accordance vdth the
provisions of paragraph 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals
as set out in Arny Order 81 of 1S45. | In the heading of the charge sheets
the accused should be described respectively as "Ludwig Knorr and Hans
Olschewski, German national in the c%rge of.......... (unit) ..... pursuant
to Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals .
4.	The following witnesses should be called to give evidence in
accordance with their statements.
(a)	In the case of Knorr: (i) Gertel, (ii) Kochanski, (iii) Lajzerowicz,
(iv) Najman, (v) Pelta.
(b)	In the case of Olschewski: (i) Lipka (Dawid Marian), (ii) Swientarski,

legal member. If, however, you consider a legal member necessary,
doubtless you will apply through JAG channels for his services.
6.	You will arrange for the accused to be defended by a German lawyer.
The accused should be supplied with copies of the statements of the
witnesses detailed above. These documents should either be translated
into German or the accused should be offered the services of an interpreter

Military Court (War Crimes) trial
Ferdinand CROSSE__________________
,3® Proceedings of a Military Court (War Crimea) held on the 16th,
17thj 18th and 19th July 1946 for the trial of the above named have been
forwarded to me in order that I may advise you thereon before confirmation,
the accused having been sentenced to death*
»
The accused was charged with ocnmitting a war crime in that he at
Hannover and elsewhere in the years 1944 and 1945 when a kepo in a oonoentra-
tion oan^ in violation of the laws and usages of war, was concerned in the
killing and ill-treatment of Allied nationals in such concentration casm.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge.
Evidence was called by the prosecution to prove that the accused
was a kapo, i.e* selected from among the prisoners to exercise authority
and supervision over the other prisoners in Hannover-Stooken and Hannover-
Ahlem Concentration Campa in 1944 and 1945. Accused was a German National
and the camp contained a large number of Itolish prisoners.
- There was also evidence of numerous acts of brutality by the accused,
often ending in the death of the victim* One witness saw the accused throw
tv8! u an innate* striking him on the back of the head with such force
that he died later* Another witness was in the camp infirmary when an air
profr*®a* 0ne of the petients started screaming and the accused
entered, dragged him from his bed and kicked him to death. It was further
said by some of the witnesses that accused used to administer "special treatment
prfs®?erf; P*8 listed in taking them to the wash house
which was just outside the infirmary and having them injected with some drug
?8US!!d their_<a®®th. There was also evidence that accused participated
in at least one unlawful hanging. In addition to these killings there was
evidence of many other acts of brutality. One of the prosedution witnesses
W8f.a Polish Doctor of Medicine, a prisoner who was Camp Doctor. In his
evidence (pp# 59-74) he tells of a number of instances when accused administer-
ed drugs to prisoners without knowing what sort of drugs they were* This
witness also corroborates the story of the injections in the wash house.
, ,	,	own evidence accused admitted beating certain of the inates
but strenuously denied any occplicity in the death of any of them. He said
he took no part in the hanging nor had he ever administered any injection to
an inmate, lb pointed out that during the march to Belsen, when other kapos
ran away being afraid of the vengeance of the prisoners on liberation, he did
not run away.	*

zu Unrecht zur Last gelegt, dass er bei den Appellen Lagerin-

TBIAL OF FBHDIHAHB GRQ33E
Vj
PBBGia OP OPENING SPEECH FOR THE PROSECUTION
May it please the Court*
■' ' ;
The accused is charged with comnitting a WAR CRIME hy lapilg
concerned in the killing and illtreatment of Allied nationals interned /
in concentration carqps at Hannover and elsewhere in the years 1944 and V
1945, in violation of the laws and usages of war, whilst he was a Kapo
in those ’comcemfcration camps*
Evidence will he produced hy the Prosecution to show that the
accused was a Kapo in Hannover-Stoecken and Hannover-Ahlem Aussenkoimian-
dos in 1944 and 1945 whilst those canps were occupied hy Polish pri-
soners and that as such he was exercising supervision over the other
prisoners in the camps, although he was himself a prisoner - in other
words that he was an intermediary between the canp authorities - the
SS guards - and the ordinary prisoners.
The evidence will show that he exercised his authority in such
a way as to cause the deaths of a number of Polish prisoners in those
camps hy reason of the savage and brutal manner in which he attacked them
and that he severely illtreated many other Poles*
I propose to call as first witness a Polish subject who will
state that he saw the accused'throw a heavy stool at one of the prisoners
in the Ahlem camp-whiah struck the prisoner violently and caused his
instantaneous death.
Another witness will state that a Polish prisoner wh|> was lying
ill in the camp infirmary at Ahlem, was dr«f«)ed from his bed by the aceu?
sed and beaten by him continiously with sucn violence that he was killed^
The witness will describe -how he saw the body of this prisoner being
carried away in a sack from where it lay on the floor, a short time
aft erwards.
i
-
The third witness will describe the beating of a Polish prisoner
named KRYSKA by the accused at Ahlem, causing his geath. He will also
describe how a prisoner SIWEK, was compelled by the accused to swallow
large quantities of liquid until he was physically incapable of absorb-
ing anymore, and was then beaten by Crosse until he was unconscious and
finally died.
The next witness will describe to the Court the way in which
he has seen the accused treating the Polish prisoners at Stcibken.
He will tell the Court of the Promotions of the accused as he*1 found
favour in the eyes of his SS superiors*
H© will tell in detail, of the manner in which a fellow-prisoner
a polish subject, was taken into the wash house by +Grosse and received
such treatment from him that he mm never emerged alive from that place
again.
!
He will also tell of Crosse’s activities at the Ahlem mine and
will describe an occasion on which he (the witness) was attacked by the
accused in the Ahlem camp,
^e will tell the Court of the fate of certain of his friends -
Polish subjects.

Deposition on oath of EROSSE, Ferdinand, male, of Nord-
hausen am Harz, An der Salze 9., at present No 101 Civilian
Interment Camp, sworn before me, Capt William Richard
DUHNDELL, East Surrey Regt. of War Crimes Investigation
Unit at ESmcmm on the 4 April 1946.
I am GROSSE, Ferdinand, bom 30th Nov 1916 in N0RDHA.USEN
am Harz, of German nationality.
From 1931 till 1937 I was employed as a painter by'the
firm Ritter & Trilling in Cologne. After that I ms cons-
cripted to the Rei chsazbeitsdienst, but deserted at the end
cf 1937• In Febr 1938 I was arrested by the German police
and brought to the Civilian Prison at Cologne. At the end
of 1938 I ms transferred to the Punishment Camp at PAFEN-
BURG, Lager 5» Snd of November or beginning of December 1941
I ms transferred to the Concentratioif Camp NEQMGAMME, and
in Aug 1943 again transferred to the Concentration Camp
HANNOVER-Stoecken. In Nov 1944 I was sent to the Concentra-
tion Camp 1HLEM. Beginning of April 1945 I came to BELSEN -
and was arrested by the English Troops on the 18th April 1945»
and brought to the Prison at CELLE, later on, however, trans—1.
ferred to BELSEN to a solitary cell.
In the middle of September sc few 1000 prisoners arrived
from AUSCHWITZ. They had already been'travelling for a week
without food, and that was -why they were in a weak condition.
As there were no cooking facilities in the camp, the food load
to be fetched during the first 3 or 4 days from ST0ECKEN. This
amounted to about 3/4 of a litre of soup per day. This happened
in the camp HANN0VER-SP0ECKM, CONTINENTAL Factory. In Nov 1944
I was sent with all prisoners to AHUM.
In ANLSM many prisoners died. The cause of this was the under- ,
nourishment and the heavy work, and the bad ^londrti'uns T)f life.
I know, that many died through blows, because I saw prisoners ^
being beaten often.
In Dec 1944 I was made Blockaltester in Block No 1 in AHUM.
I have beaten people on several occasions, because they had stolen
frmm their comrades.. For this I only used ray hands. I have never,
used a rubber truncheon or a wooden stick.
I know that the following kapos have beaten'people with a elec-
tric cable: the camp eld senior Hans Yffi^SIER, the shift kapo
Hans SCHUH, the shift kapo Paul HENNING, the shift kapo Fritz
VOGT, the shift kapo'Ludwig KN0RR. I also know that the following
block seniors beat people with ah electric cable: One of these
was called GUSTAV -with Christian name, one called HERMANN, one was
called HAMBURGER, and-another called Emil KRAUSE.
I remember?^ the b eginning of March 1945, a man who bad come
from HILDESHEIM, was hung by the camp seniors, Hans WEXjfijfSLSR,
Hans SCHUH and Fp.tz VOGT, in the ablutions hut. I have seen
gerasnally the body hang in the ablutions hut.﻿/
^ du^cL
&JJL

When the prisoners returned from -srork in the mine
they had to take a shower "bath* The shift kapo was
responsible for this,. I know that .'the block senior
SCHUH very often forced those prisoners, who did not
want to wash, to wafah themselves. As the water was
very cold, and the hut was also very cold, very often
the. prisoners could not stand up to this treatment,
and collapsed. I know that many people died on account
of this.
I myself have, seen how the shift kapd Ludwig KNORR
from YTENA, nicknamed the "Wiener Seppl" hit a pri-
soner with a shovel. The man sustained a deep wound
on the side and ms brought into the hospital. I know
that the man died later on. He had two sons in the camp.
.Furthermore I have seen how Ludwig KNOHR threw prisoners
into the water. As the water -was very cold, the priso-
ners died of its effects. This happened almost daily.
When KNOER was supervising a shift, it was necessary
that 3-4 prisoners were brought into the hospital,
almost daily. Most of his victims were Poles.
Between the first and 7th April 1945 we marched from
HANNOVER to BERGM'I-BELSEN. On the way there.nobody was
shot or beaten to death. All the others* German kapos
and foremen have escaped on the way. I wa& the only one,
who arrived in BERGHI—BEL3EN• As I had a* conscience,
Liitfl'tr was no necessity fur me to run away.

TKttlS PROSECUTION PINAL SPEECH ttf THE CASE OP FERDINAI-TD ..CROSSE
-----------'	“	JL- M. (r_.
May it please the Court.
The charge against the accused is that the accused was con-
cerned in killing and illtreatment of Allied nationals interned in
the concentration camps at Stoecken and Ahlem in the years 1944 and
1945.
It is not disputed that the accused was a Kapo in those
camps, and that he was in charge of the Camp Hospital at Ahelm and
Stoecken. It is not disputed that all the peisoners in those camps,
except the Kapos, were of Polish nationality and therefore Allied
nationals.
It is not even disputed that the accused ill-treated those
prisoners in the camps for he admits that his deposition is correct
and statesfherein that he haS “beaten people on several occasions.
His Defence is mainly that other Kapos were responsible for
the beatings which caused the death. No doubt, they were. But we are
concerned v/ith the accuded himself, FERDINAND CROSSE.
It is my duty to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Po-
lish prisoners died as a result of voluntary acts of the accused,
and that he intended their deaths and received no provocation suf-
ficient to excuse those acts and that those acts were unlawful, that •
is, wfcere not for example an excecution ©ap a sentenfie of a lawful
Court.
It is sufficient with regard to the intention for me to
show that he intended only to hurt if the act was one intrinsically
likely to kill.
'
Further where there is a coranon intention amongst several
persons, every act which is done by one of those persons in execution
of that intend*; ^ isjiaw, done by all of them, so long as the act don
relates to the common design.
The witness Neufeld recognised the accused. Ae saw him
beating a Polish prisoner who was in the next bed to hiM in the hos-
pital, he saw that prisoner lying motionless on the floor after he
had been beaten by the accused, and he saw that the bodies of Poles
were .aken out in a paliasse.
The evidence of the accused himself stated that dead bodies
were always placed on a death heap	in paliasses.
Neufeld described an occasion of the selection of five sick
prisoners from the hospital (of whom he was one) which tool: place late
one night. The Lageraeltester was present and those five prisoners
were• tg,ken and lined outside the wash house. Neufeld looked through!
the keysrhole after some of the prisoners had been taken inside the
wash house. He saw the Lageraeltester giving them an injection with
a syringe whilst the accused was holding the prisoners’ arms.jrRemem-
ber*%4T Oytryn. Owing to' the air raid v/arning Neufeld was not taken
into the.wash house, and he returned with another prisoner to the
Revier. ^e never saw Cytryn again.
Dr. Fajwolowicz saw the Lageraeltester and the accused
gelect five prisoners and remembered that Neufeld was one of them.
He saw them being lined up outside the wash house, he_saw Neufeld
hnd another of those five prisoners return to the Revier later, but
he never saw the other three ’again, in the Revier. He knew all those
men by sight because they were his patients in the hospital. Shortly
afterwards he received a notice from the Lageraeltester saying that﻿f
./
143
Jri
-tnree men had died in the wash house. AV saw their bodies. They were
the same three men who had been amongst the five selected on that par-
ticular night, and who had never returned from the wash house.
Blumenstein worked in the infirmary and saw often the accused
coming in late at night asking for the syringe. Dr. Fajwolowicz often sme
led petrol in the wash house after the accused had been in, with pri-
soners and with the syringe. Sven if the accused did not administer
the injections he was aiding and abetting the Lageraeltester on that
particular occasion , and he is therefore equally responsible fortthe
result of that action , and the evidence is clear, that three Polish
prisoners died as a result of th$f treatment they received in thifroom.
These men were selected from the sick prisoners, it was
a cold and calculated act done in cold blood and there could be no law-
ful justification whatsoever.
The Defence has stated that a Dr. Droste who was Doctor to
the camp staff at Ahlem signed the death certificates and that the cause
of death which was given on the Prisoners* Index Cards was written bv the
camp doctor and was always a normal cause. (Incidentd/y it may be point-
ed out, that_this is a very peculiar statement, if the accused’s state-
ment ■f>©' ttio—foisi that the dehths of prisoners had been caused by other
Kapos, tm is correct).
But the defence witness could not say from his own know-
ledge ithat this Dr. Droste ever even saw the bodies before he signed
the death* certificates, and there is evidence of Dr. F. to show that
he merely glanced at them and sigaed the certificates without carrying
out any investigation of the condition of'the bodies. Further it is
significant that the Lageraelteste passed the index cards to the
witness who prepared death certificates for Dr. Droste to sign, and
that the cause of death had wbiiTwritten t* before the Lageraelteste
received the card by the camp doctor4md this is significant) who was
a pr is one rhim self. ^	---
It is clear '.therefore that the contents of the death certi-
ficates signed by Dr. Droste can carry no weight as evidence, whatsoever.
t	'
Diament was certain that the Polish prisoner who was struck
with a stool was cold and was not bleeding as he assisted in carrying
him out of the hut. Further he recognises the accused and he saw him-
self that the stool was thrown with considerable force and definitely
aimed at the prisoner.	,
Dudek knew Kryska well because they lived in the same block
and he slept in the next bed to him. me saw him how he himself was beater
by Grosse, he never saw him again after that day. He sat the brutal mal-
treatment of the prisoner Siwek and he saw the man being taken away ft
by two other prisoners and he never saw him"again.	/
Blumenstein had two brothers in the camp, Ghemia and MoschL..
Both died within a few days after entering the caqs hospital. In both
cases the witness spoke to them shortly before tiiey^died and they told
him that their injuries had been caused by Grosse, the: accused.
When they were admitted into hospital they were in a very
bad condition and it may well be thought that those two. men did not
expect to live when they made their statements to their-':brother. In
fact they did not live and died a few days later. '.' f; •
This witness also remembered that' he saw the 'dead bodv of a
prisoner called Gotteine, he had seen him being taken to. the wash-house.
A,few hrs later Blumenstein found his dead body there.
^Gelbartowicz may have appeared to contradict his own story
finally clear that his account of the beating and the
killing the Polish prisoners in the wash house fitted in with all his﻿
V\
^mer statements, which he hfed previously made(for he had not previtms-
lv said that there was a hreak of two minutes during which the accused
had gontaway and returned. ) With the exception, of ■©**©, G-lehartowicz,
a. one of these witnesses, were tever beaten or ill treated by the accused.
^Therefore the evidence cannot be regarded as fcks biased by reason of
personal illtreatment.
I do not propose to fiecount in detail the innumerable _
instances of beatings which the witnesses have described, both in the
two camps, Steocken and Ahlem, at the working sites and m the camp
hospital.
*	It is sufficienltyelear from the evidence of the Prosecution

witnesses that all the beat^s« ~ --------- —■ ----- ---	1
reasons,/‘such aS)for exanple,#«3? not marshing in step;, from the worl
ing place at the Continental factory,} or for no reason, whatsoever.
The severity of the beatings was such, that in the con— i
ditions those prisoners were in, they were likely to cause death
if indeed they were not actually administered with th^ intention of y
causing death. And there is evidence that that intention was present ^
#.4l many of these occasions. The accused is equally responsible^ even i
though in some cases he might have been unconcerned as to whejwCBfcfik

NOTES ON THE CASE
It- ,
(Under this heading should be included the view taken as to (a) the degree of
responsibility of the accused in view of his official position, e.g., was offence
committed on the offender’s own initiative, or in obedience to orders, or in carrying
out a system approved by authority or a legal provision ; (b) the probable defence,
(c) whether the case appears to be reasonably complete.)
This will appear to be a clear concentration camp case and there
is no defence to the general charge.﻿Translation, of	■ Production Ho.-

Deposition on oath of Valter DOIlStH, uale, of IL'iiBUISO-SiiSJaL# Grosser Kanp kf
sworn before Iiajor Anton 'alter DEEtlD, Gen* List, of Var Cri.ies Investigation
Unit, at ILIiBuHG, on 7th Hay, 1946.
I an Valter DQHSL, born on 22nd July, 1898, at	resident at HAMBURG’*
SAoBL, Grosser Kanp.. 4, Tel.:	20 82 83. Occupation: Chequer of the Hamburg
Vater Y/orks, Geman nationality.
On the 8th i.pril, 1933 I was a.rrested for political reasons and on 3rd Hay,
1943, !■ was.put into the concentration canp HEUEHG/ii.Ii.-IE* I was sent to the
.Aissenkouuando BEHtOORP near HuIiS'JKDT on the 25th April, 1944*
line BBHl'DORB1 canp was founded in-February 1 944 with a transport of appr. 200
prisoners fron .ItaKJNGAalB and .another 200 fron BUCIiBl'MvID, It was an
auxiliary canp of MiUENG-Klffi!, situated between BRilNSVICK and ILYGDBBURG, ly
transport which arrived in April 1944 consisted of 100 persons. Later two
or three smaller transports arrived from I'iEUEMGjLliB, so that the average
number of male prisoners was 750.
Ve were employed to convert a former saltmine into a factory. In August 1 944
the first transports of female prisoners arrived from ll.YvYlGSBRUIiJCK. Those
were employed on the machines which had been installed in the meantime.
When the camp was evacuated in April 1 945 we were 1350 male and 4500 female
prisoners. Most of the prisoners were Russians- and Poles, but there were
also many Frenchmen and prisoners of other European nations.
Until January 1945 the	mortality rate	was very small.	Y/hen, however, the
food rations were cut,	people started	to die in great	number, and from
February 1 945 appr. 25 persons died daily.
The commander of the camp was Obersturmfuehrer POPHiML.JG-ElL, the SS—man in
charge of the work was Unterscharfuehrer Hannes BLOEOKER, and Blockfuehrer
was Rottenfuehrer RHUHKEN.
The male prisoners were housed on the	ground floor of	a	big stone building,
the women lived on the	first floor of	the. sane house.	The.men slept at
first in double-tired, later in 4“tired beds, 2 and 3 men slept in each bed.
The food consisted of a bread, ration of appr. 400 gr, a day, a stew for lunch
and a cup of coffee in the -morning and in the evening. In January 1 945 the
rations were cut so-that we only got 250 gr. bread a day and the‘quantity of
the lunch decreased and the quality got worse. Additional rations for heavy
workers did not exist. Eating utensils were very short, so that f»i. 5 nan
had only one pot.
The reveille was at 4 o'clock in the morning, then the beds were made and food
was. distributed at 1 /2. The prisoners had to pass through the dining room.
There they got their, coffee and bread.	Then they had.to go out into the yeard
where they had to eat and whether summer or winter had to Wait until they moved
off to work at 6 o'clock. Sunday was a working-day as every other.
For the first 6 months no change of clothing was possible, neither did we have
an opportunity to have a shower or bath. Only after 6 months washing
facilities were provided. There was np ,exchange of clothing. Most of the
prisoners were dressed in rags,. Many had.no shoes-.and had to go about
barefooted. Only one blanket was'provided for each prisoner..﻿— «

xhe tlruee above uentioned SS’-nen ran the canp* \fe were guarded by appr.- 350
raen of Geraan Luftwaffe, Punishr.ients of prisoners were carried out by Rotten-
fuehrer BRUEOai. Daily I could observe DEUl'IIluiT horse-whipping prisoners. In
the canp he always walked about with, a steelwhip* 4- feet long* which consisted
of steel blades covered v/ith leather, I myself was twice whipped by hia. He
beat the women as brutally as the non,
Iwo Russians*'a short tine after that another Russian and then a Polish woman
prisoner were hanged on BHINXEffiB order. I'would like to mention two examples
out of hundreds of cases of maltreatment.
At the beginning of .March 1 945 BEUIEUHT saw two Frenchmen pick up a few potatoes
in the street. Both Frenchmen were fetched into the camp and there they were
whipped. One got 35, the other 47 lashes. Both were unconscious after the
whipping, and then they were put in chains for two days.
In another ca.se which happened in August 1 944 BRUl'EH'I saw a Pole writing a
letter. BRUHKiHM whipped him until the Pole was unconscious. Nearly always
the victims were beaten down unconscious by BRUNKEN. POPPSNHAGHN and BLOCABR
knew of BRUKIQIT's atrocious behaviour, but did nothing to prevent it.
Our only two doctors were two prisoners, one a plumber, and one a dentist.
Only in November 1 944-we got a real French doctor. lledical equipment.was
extremely short. In the last 3 months we had a typhus epidemic on which
many people died. fhe worst of the camp was, however, the evacuation.
On a Monday, the 7th or 8th of April 1945 all the women were loaded into
trucks, and on the same afternoon all the men. uHaen all the trucks, appr.
70-75, were hintched together the locomotive could not pull the train,^
Therefore 10-12 trucks, of women were emptied and the women were crowded into
other already full waggons. There were 200—220 women on each open cattle
truck, I myself was present at a roll-call and know the number for certain*
¥e men were crowded 1 50—180 in a truck.
In IaAG-DEBURG- The Americans were already approaching the station, and the
civilian locomotive driver left. A member of the guard took over the job ox
driving the locomotive. ¥e drove thsn zick-zaclc through the country. ■ On
the second day people started to die through hunger and the terrible conditions.
We did not get anuthing to eat for the first 5 days of the journey. We
stopped at WITTNHBEE&E and 60-75 persons were buried in a nassgrave. ^ Later
another 150 persons were buried in a uassgrave on another station. Many deaa
were thrown out of the truck by other prisoners. We stopped for 4 days at
SUFLSDOHF on a railway siding. During this time we had 300 dead which were
buried in two massgraves* On the first evening at SUELSDOEF 5 waggons ox
women of the 32 got potatoes, two for each woman, the following day we got
the first real meal.
Appr. 500-600 persons died on this journey. BQESSMtLSG® was in charge of the
transport. BRUNKEN was the leader of the'transport of the men. During the
journey appr. 20-25 men who tried to"fetch water for the women were shot by
the guards especially by BRUNKEN.

DEPOSITION on oath of Ernst Hermann Karl Heinrioh BOESOH, male, of
HAMBURG 30, Moltckestr. 22/11, sworn before Major Anton Walter FREUD,
Gen. List, of War Crimes Investigation Unit, at HAMBURG on 7th May
I am Ernst Hermann Karl Heinrich BOESCH, horn on the- 10th October,
1893, at BOIZENBURG, resident at HAMBURG, Moltckestr. 22/II,. profession:
barber, of German nationality.
On the 4th February 1934 I ’^as arrested by the Gestapo for political
reasons. At first I was interned in the FULHSBUET-TEL concentration camp
and in March 1941 .1 came to the NEUENGAHME concentration camp.
From March 194a until 20th April 1945 I was in the Aussenkomrnando
3EHND0RF near HELMSTEDT. The camp commander was S3-0berstrumfuehrer
POPPENHAGEN, Blockleader was SS-Rottenfuehrer BRUNKEN, resident at
PAPENBURG/Emsland.
BRUNKEN was an especially cruel man, he used to walk about in the
camp with a stick a;-club with which he used to beat the prisoners.
I pan -remember two cases especially well as I have seen them myself.
On the 24th July 1944* on receiving the breakfast, which was had in
the open air Rottenfuehrer BRUNKEN entered the camp. He was annoyed that
the door was squeaking and ordered a Russian Iwan Iwanotschek to grease
the door with his breakfast ration of margarine. The Russian who was not
willing to use his meagre ration for such purpose did not comply with the
order at once. Thereupon BRUNKEN started at once beating the Russian with
a club. He beat him for about 5 minutes until the Russian remained
unconscious on the floor. He was carried by some comrades to the sick bay
and he was also transported on the same day to the hospital at DRUETTE.
Three or four days later we '.were officially informed that the Russian died,
on the next day of interior injuries and therefore he will have to be crossed
off the card-index.
The second case happened in October 1944* About 1 1/2 hour before the
end of work I happened to come across when a female Russian prisoner whose
name was Maria and who was working on a tool maohine '.was beaten by BRUNKEN.
I do not know the reason as I only arrived when BRUNKEN was already beating
her. He beat her with a short beating instrument and. kicked her with the
feet. Myself and. some Russians then transported the woman to the exit of
the working place. During this transport from the working place to the
women's camp the woman died, so when arriving in the camp we transported
only a dead body.
On the 20th April 1945 the BEHNDORF camp should have been evacuated to
NEUSTADT/HOLSTEIN. POPPENHAGEN and BRUNKEN were in charge of the transport-
ation. We were loaded into goods-trucks I4O-I6O in each. Most of the
trucks were open. The transport took 9 days. During that time we received
twice one piece of bread of about JOO gr. each* The trucks were so full that
we had to stand very close together. People who fell down were trampled to
death as there was no room to lie down. During the night many of the people
who fell down to the ground were thrown out of the truck.
When the transport left HELMSTEDT we ’were about 5000 prisoners. We
stopped at WITTENBERGE/Elbe and the dead, who were not thrown out during the
night were buried in a massgrave near the station on a chaussee. There wer©
57 dead. The next stop was SUELSDORF just before SCHWEIN. Approximately
250 people v/ho died on the way ’were buried there in a massgrave. This grave﻿_ 2 -
too is in the vicinity of the station. After 9 clays we arrived at Y/OUBBKLIW
near LUDVIGSLTJST in a half completed prisoners of ’-var camp. There were
already 1500-2000 prisoners. Gti the journey appr. 500 people died of
starvation and exhaustion.

DEPOSITION on oath of Emil KUENDER, male, of HAMBURG-RhHLSTEDT,
Alte Landstr. 47> Tel. 32 10 31, sworn before Major Anton '.falter PREUD,
Gen. List, of War Crimes Investigation Unit, at HAMBURG on 7 May 4b.
I am Emil KUENDER, born on 21 Sep 1895 at HAMBURG, residence
HAMBURG—RAHLSTEDT, Alte Landstr 47, by profession secretary, of German
nationality.
For political reasons I was arrested in February 1943 and came to
the NEUENGAMME concentration camp. Beginning 1944 I came from NEUENGAMME
to the Aussenkommando BEHNDORE near HELMSTEDT. Commander of that camp
was POFPENHAGEN, and Blockfuxhrer was BRUNKEN.
BRUNKEN was an especially cruel man y/ho very often beat prisoners with
a whip or a club. I remember ’well two especially striking cases of
illtreatment as I saw them happening myself.
One day in summer 1944 just before moving off for work I saw from my
rank and file that BRUNKEN was beating dovm a prisoner at the gate of the
camp. BRUNKEN hit the prisoner with some sort of instrument until he
remained lying on the ground. The prisoner then was put on a stretcher by
his comrades and carried away passed me to the sick-bay* When they passed
me I recognised him as a Russian whose name was mentioned to me by an
orderly but I forgot it sinde. As the prisoner was carried passed me I
had the opportunity to observe that he was bloodshot; A few days afterwards
it was commonly known in the .carp that the Russian died in Consequence of
that beating.
The second case as far a.s I can remember happened October or November
1944-* A Russian SASCHA was called into the orderly room by BRUNKEN where
he received 50 or 75 la.sh.es on his behind. „s far as I could, see with
BRUNKEN1s whip. The Russian ’was unconscious then.
I kno’.r some more of these cases by which BRUNKEN committed atrocities
in a similar fashion with other prisoners.
POPPENHAGEN was responsible for the BEHNDORP camp and. he never
undertook anytning to prevent BRUNKEN illtreating the prisoners*
End of April 1945 BEHNDORE was dissolved and we were taken away.
The prisoners was pressed into Waggons of 120—170 each, iill had to stand.
On the second day people stated to die in consequence of starvation and
exhaustion. The journey lasted approximately 10 days and we had altogether
3-4 meals during the v/hole time. In my opinion at least 200 prisoners
must have died on this transport of starvation and exhaustion. Responsible
for that transport was POPPENHAGEN.

I am Gerhard P0FPENH4GEN, horn on 26 Sept 1909 at H4MBURG, hy
profession cormercial employee, of German nationality.
In the year 1949 I came as a SS-Rottenfuehrer to NEUMGuMIviE and I was
there until the capitulation. My last rank was OBERStumfuehrer.
+ *
Until 1943 I was employed as a teleprinter, then I came to the officer's
academy. 1943 I cane hack again to NEIIMGmvIME and took over a company of
guards. July 1944 I was sent to the Aussenkonnando BEBNDORF near HEIivISTEET,
v/herc I became camp commander. ns camp coinmander I was fully responsible
for the male e.nd female damp.
Under me were two SS-mcni Untcrscharfuchrer Hans BLOEGilER and
Rottenfuehrer BRUNIQUN. The guard came from a Luftwaffenwach-kompanie. The
average establishment of the camp was 2000 male and female prisoners.
Till the beginning of 1945 the number of mortality was small. But as
the rations were decreased by order of the Hauptwirtsehaftsamy, the number
of mortality increased.
Beatings and punishments wore not to be given independently by
Kommandofuehrcrn. I have several times reminded my Kommandofuehrers that
it was not allowed in my camp to beat the prisoners. I am completely
ignorant that 3RUNKEN beat to death several foreigners. I am not aware of the
fact that prisoners were hanged in my camp by BEUNKEN although it would have
been my duty as Lagerfuehrer to be concerned with such matters.
In April 1945 I got the order from PAULY to evacuate the camp to
WOEBBELIN. I was i/c transport from BEffiBORE/HEIMSTEDT to ¥0EBBELIN and as
such fully responsible.
I do not know how many people were loaded into one truck, I guess
70-75. I did not know that ’.women up to 200 were in one open truck. I gave
orders that food should be distributed to thu prisoners during the journey
and I am surprised to hear that that did not happen during the first five
days of the journey.
The prisoners who died on the journey were buried in three mass-graves
in i/ITTENBERGE, SUELSD0EF and U0EB3ELIN-, but I do not know the number of the
prisoners who died altogether. Many prisoners escaped on the journey but
I am not aware that any were shot whilst trying to escape.
I know that when we reached MaGDEBURG the spearheads of the Americans
were already in the town. I did not hand over the train to the Americans
because X was ordered by PAULY to take the transport to T/0E3BELIN. If I
would have surrendered myself and the prisoners in MAGDEBURG to the Americans
the lives of many prisoners who died later on the journey would have been
saved. In American captivity, it would not have been necessary for me to
justidy my actions before PAULY. But as I never listened to the BBC I was
not very well informed about the current war situation,
I joined the NSUxP in 1932 and in July 1933 the S3.

The first half year the number of dead of the prisoners was small as most of
the sick were transported to DRUETTE. Later on the rate of mortality increased
I was usually in the prisoners' camp mostly in the evenings to calculate the
output of work for the next day. BRUNOl, however, was more often in the
camp than myself. I never did anything to prevent BEUNKEN to beat the
prisoners, because I did not know he was doing.
A few days before the camp was evacuated I went on leave and I never returned.

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a) ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.’' simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(а)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(б)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

in the incident was that he was responsible for the cremation of
the bodies. Since there appears to be no evidence that this

submitted that his name should nevertheless be included in the
list of accused and the proof thereof before a War Crimes Tribunal
be attempted.

(Under this heading should be included the view taken as to (a) the degree of
responsibility of the accused in view of his official position, e.g., was offence
committed on the offender’s own initiative, or in obedience to orders, or in carrying
out a system approved by authority or a legal provision ; {b) the probable defence;
(c) whether the case appears to be reasonably complete.)
This would appear to be a clear case of killing5 though in the case of
BRAKE he may be acquitted of this charge as he did not actually take part in the
killing himself, though he assisted in it.﻿Extract from
DEPOSITION

Tadeusz KOVALSKI
Production No.5
(neuen GAIvIME' majors)
of the Polish Hospital, MFFKRUG, born on 18th April 1908, in BIALA-
CERKIEW/KEEW. Occupation: Doctor of medicine.
DEPOSITION on oath of Tadeusz KOWALSKI, male of Polish Hospital, HAPEKRUGj
sworn before Major Ronald BSNTHAM-GREEN, R.A. of No.2 War Crimes Investigation
Team at HAMBURG on 17th December 1945.
I was first arrested on the 2nd December 1942 for activity
in the Polish anti-German organisation, and was brought to
2AKQPMrE, later to TARNOW, and afterwards I vrent to AUSCHWITZ
in the January of 1943* I was there until the following
April. In April 1943 I then came to NEUENGAvIf/IE. For the
first six months I was in quarantine. Afterwards I worked as a
medical orderly in Revier 11. Prom 1943 to 1944 I was in the
TB section as a doctor ....
..... In the winter of 1944 twenty to twenty-five children
between the ages of six and twelve were brought from AUSCHWITZ
to NEUENGAMME and placed in a special block No.4, from which all
adults vrere removed. Eighty percent of the children were Polish;
the others were Dutch or French. At this time Block 4 was not
only for TB causes but for other cases as well. Of all these
children, only one was suspected of TB. Dr. GUENOUIE was in
charge of them. I saw him with the children in the X-ray room,
and have also seen X-ray photos of them. Dr. GUENOUIE and
Dr. FLORENCE told me that the children had incisions either on
the left or right breast or on the arm, into which TB bacteria _
had been rubbed. I myself saw the infected parts, on which red
spots were noticeable. The infected parts v/ere very painful and
swollen. Some weeks later I saw these children in the X*-ray room
and noticed that the glands under their arras were swollen. One
day I also saw that the glands of one of these children had been
removed by Dr. DOSLIE BOGUMIL of PRAGUE under a local aenesthetic.
BOGOMIL dealt with the case in the presence of the SDG on orders
from Dr. HEISSMEYKR. The glands were placed in a sterilised
test-tube which Dr. HEISSMSYER took with him. Dr. GUENOUIE told
me that all the children were treated several times under the
arm in this way. On the 18th April 1945 all the children were
taken away, along with the doctors. .....

interned at’ riMLOBUETTEL jail, HAMBTBGr, sworn before Major
Anton Walter FREUD, Gen. List, of War Crimes Investigation
Unit, at HAl\£BUPv.G, on 4th May 1946,
I am Alfred TZKLBIKtKI, born on 29.8.1902 in CRL'llOBH, Kreis
RA/ttSCH, by profession doctor, of German nationality.
In November 1932 I joined the NSDAP and at the same time the
SS. On the 2nd of August 1933 I came to the NEUENGAvUE
concentration camp and there I was chief doctor.
One day between the 26th and 28th April 1945 I was called to
the camp commander Max PAULY who gave me the order to poison
the 20 Jewish children who were interned in the NGUENGMvME
camp for medical experiments in order to get rid of unpleasant
witnesses. At first I used some excuses that I had no poison
etc. but PAULY insisted on the order being carried out.
*
On the seme evening I went to HAMBURG to the ^ussenKommando
Spaldingstrasse with the children, six Russians and the nurses
of the children who also were to be executed. SPECK, DREIMANK,
IttEHAGEN and the driver PETERSEN were with us. In Spalding-
strasse I reported to the area commander 3TRIEPEL. I made it
clear to him that I was not prepared to poison the children.
3TRIPEEL replied: "You are a coward and I have to taJce the
matter in my own hands".
3TRIPEEL, myself and the above mentioned escort,
the children and the grown-ups who were to be executed went to
BULIENEU3ERDAMM Aussenlconinando. We were received by JMUCTI,
commander of BULIENHUSERDil'M, PRAM, a BlocKlciter. mad after
they had a short talie with 3TRIPPEL I was informed that every-
thing was going according to plan. The children were taken down to the
cellar. ■'Except the children there were PRAHM, JAUCH and myself in the
cellar. I believe WIEKAGEN was standing guard in front of the door.
The nurses of the children and the grown-up Russians were
taken to a separate room of the cellar and hanged there. I do
not know by whom as I was not present. I stayed with the
children.
After a while PRABM came and said the children should get
undressed. I then gave the children a morphium injection and
they fell asleep. Then the children were hanged on hooks on
the wall by PRAHM.
When all persons who had come with the first transport to the
BULIENHUSERDjI/M were hanged, a second transport of about 24
Russians arrived. About 18 of those Russians were hanged in
the cellar of BUILENHUSEKDAMM by PRAM, JAUCH, WTEMGEN and
DREBIANN. The area commander STRIPEEL was present at times.
At 7 o'clock in the morning when all people of the'second
transport were hanged I went back to NEUENGIJVME.

PHEUD, Gen. List, of No. 2 War Criucs Investigation
Team at Hamburg on 27th February 1946.
I ■was first arrested in June 1933 at DUESSEIDOHF. I
was released in December 1933 and imprisoned again
in January 193ii On Hpril 21, 1933 I was released
and arrested again on 2nd July 1935. In 1936 I came
to the concentration camp 3mC5SENH.lUSEN, and from there
I was sent to the concentration camp NEUENGJIME on
4th June 1940.
Since 1942/43 Enterscharfuhrer Willi BR4CKE was chef
of the Registry in the concentration camp Neuengamme,
and as such he was also in charge of the crematorium.
He organised the transports of the bodies from the
morge to the crematorium. I was the Ke.po in charge
of the wording parties and it was my duty to select
the people who were to worn on those transports.
The 20-25 persons who were employed on this
Kommando were Dutchmen, Russians and prenebmen,
which I selected in my capacity as Kapo of the
worJ.ci.ng parties. T hen the horse-cart which was
used for the transport of the bodies got stuclc
in the mud, Braciee started to beat the prisoners
of this Kommando with a whip or any other object
which he happened to get hold of. He beat them
so long until the cart got moving again and if
it had to be carried -by the prisoners.
One incident I can remember very well, f.t the end
of January 194-5 the mart got stuclc 20 metres from
the morgue in front of the bath. There Bracice was
present. He snatched the whip from the carter
turned it round and with tht thicK end of the
whip beat the prisoners madly not caring' where
he hit them.
Approximately a fortnight later n February 1945
when the ground was very muddy from a long period
of rain a similar incident occurred near the old
crematorium where the cart got studs in the mud
up to the axle. On this occasion he got hold
of the handle of. a shovel and beat the prisoners
with it until they had carried the cart to a
place approximately 30 metres from the new
crematorium. ;„s from there the cart could not
be moved any further and all beating was in vein,
the prisoners had to carry the bodies singly to
the crematorium.

Deposition on oath of Johann PRJM, male, at
present interned at ..LT01L. jail, I-OIBURG, svorn
before Major inton ¥o.ltcr ISEUD, Gen. List, of
rr Crimes Investigation Unit, at IL'MBURG on
2nd May 1946.
I an Johann NELlli, born on 2oth i.pril 1901 at
GIEVE Kreis Niederdittaarschen, Occupation: uoricer,
of German nationr,lity.
On the 1st November 1933 I joined the 3S and on
1st May 1937 the NSDiP, In November 1942 I came
to the NEUENGJffl'IE concentration camp on guard duties.
Later I became blocKleader. In November 1944
I came to the Jmssenicommando BULLENHUSEEDilCI at
Hil'lBURG as a blocicleader, uhere I stayed until
the end of Jpril 1945* The leader of the
BULIENHUSESD.J/M was Oberschgrfuhrer J^UGH, the
area commander mas STBIBBEL.
One doy at the end of April 1945 J-UCII told me"
that transport was due to a.rrive at the 13ULLEN-
HUSEEDiJ'M from HEUENGIJflViE that evening. „t
about 10 o'clock - I was in my room - JAUCH
called me with the words "they have arrived".
I went down to the cellar where the new-arrivsls
were collected. They were about 20 children,
age 12 to 16 years. ^ few appeared to be ill.
Except the children Dr. TZEEBINSKI,.J^JJCH arid
DRSDOIN were in the cellar, end STRIBBEL was
there at times. VIEEL DEN stood at the door, and
SPECK was also a guard outside the building.
The name of the driver who brought the children
was PETERSEN.
The children had to undress in a room in the cellar3
then they were led Into another room where they
were given an injection by Dr. TZEEBINSKI, so that
they fell asleep. Those who were still giving signs
of life after'the injection were carried to another
room. There a rope was placed on their necK:
and, lifce pictures, they were -hanged on hooks
on the wall. This was done by JAUCH, myself,
TZEEBINSKI and DKEEVL'JM. STRIBBEL was also there
temporarily. The bodies were kept in the room
-and were collected on the following clay from

Truppenubungspl&ts, near P.DERBOBN, sworn before Staff Serjeant Derek SHELTON,
8th King's Royal Irish Hussars of War Crimes Investigation Unit at P^iDERBORN
on the 13th day of May 1946,
1.	I am Ewald J..JJCH born on 23 ^pril 1902 in SCHWENNINGEN am Neckar.
I am a Reich German. I joined the party in February 1932. In Dpril or
May 1934 I was drafted into the SS. On 20 Ipril 1940 I went to NEUENG4MME
Concentration Camp. There I was firstly a guard, later Rapportfuhrer end
then Kommandofuhrer of various aussemcoramandos. In December 1944 I went to
the BULLENHEUSERDJffl Camp in Hamburg as Kommandofuhrer. ■ I remained there
until the collapse.
2.	One night about the middle of .joril 1945 I was awakened at 2 o’clock
by Obersturmfuhrer STRIFPEL and camp doctor Hauptsturmfuhrer TZREBINSKI,
Tzrebinski told me that a transport of about 20 Jewish Hungarian
children, aged between 6 and 12 years, had arrived. These children, he
said, had to be injected and then taken to the THERESIENSTjJDT, I asked
the children from whence they had come and they told me they were from
NEUENGiiMvCE. Tzrebinski said he came on the orders of the Lagerfuhrer PhULI.
I then got up and took the Doctors STRIPPED, DREBO®, TCEEHiGEN, SPECK and
FRAHM to the Cellar. The children were brought to the cellar by car.
Tzrebinski told the children they had to undress for a bath. The doctor
went into another room and the ch.ldren were sent in to him by me individually.
Frahn helped the doctor. I only saw one child injected, otherwise I
remained in the changing room. When all the children had been injected they
were led into the last room on the left. There they were made to lie down.
I am not aware that the children were subsequently banged end I also know that
there were no facilities for hanging in the room. There, were no hooks in
the wall. I also cannot remember that adults had accompanied the transport
of the children, or that any were hanged at the same time, j.s far as I know,
Dreimann prepared’ the execution of the 'bale transport.
3.	When all the children had been injected, Tzrebinski told me that they
would not wake up again. There then arrived some 30 miles, Poles or Russians,
of whom a few escaped and who were led immediately from the truck into the
changing room. From there they went to the machine room.* It Was my duty
to supervise the men whilst undressing. I knew that these men had to be
hanged. Dreimann, Frabm, Speck and iehagen attended to the hanging in the
machine roomi Tzrebinski and Stripped were also in the machine room but I
do not know whether they themselves took part in the hangings. I also went
two or three times into the machine room to see what was in progress. The
prisoners were hanging there on a beam. I myself hanged nobody, but I place^
on one side a few boxes which were in the way. I helped periodically in
taking down prisoners. At 8 o'clock in the morning I went back to my room.
4.	I did not enter the rooms again where the corpses lay until the
following evening when the dead children and the men who had been hanged were
collected.
5.	I only beat prisoners if they had stolen from a fellow prisoner and
lied to me. I only struck them in the face with my hand and sometimes gave
/them kicks.﻿them KioKs. I refrained from naming a report to the Komiaandant,
otherwise I alvfays ccxed for the prisoners.

DEPOSITION on oath of Gustav Wilhelm BRAKE, male, at present interned
at No. 4 C.I„C, RECKLINGHAUSEN, sworn before Staff Sergeant Derek SHELTON,
8'th Kings Royal Irish Hussars of War Crimes Investigation Unit at
Recklinghausen on the 14th day of May 1946.
1.	I am Gustav Wilhelm BRAKE, born 17 October 1901 in ZIERENBERG near
Kassel* I am.a Reich German* I joined the party on 1 May 193'!• On
1 October 1932 I joined the Allgemeine SS and on 15 February 1939 I was •
drafted into the Waffen SS*. On 19 April I94O I went to NEUENGAMME
Concentration Camp. On 15 September of that year I was released but was
called up again in November 1940, and as I was not fit for military service
was sent back to	Neuengamme.	At first I was a	guard. On 1	March 1941 I
became documents	clerk and on 1 October 1942 I	was promoted	to Unterschar-
fuhrer* In this position and rank I remained until 30 April 1945 when the
camp was broken up. On 21 July 1945 I was arrested in MUHLHEIM and some
days later ’went to the camp in Recklinghausen.
2.	As records clerk it was my job to register dead persons. In addition
I also had under	me the Camp	Crematorium where	dead persons	were burned.
3* I can remember how, one	very wet day, the	truck which was loaded with
corpses stuck fast. The truck was drawn by two horses and ’was pushed by
about 30 prisoners. I first of all urged on the horses and noticed that
the truck v/as not being pushed from behind. As the truck had to be
unloaded before daylight I struck the prisoners with the whip. I do not
think I struck the prisoners with the blade of a spade but I can remember
having once hit a prisoner by the name of HASCH with my hand.
4» I remember that about 14 days before the collapse a transport of corpses
arrived from Hamburg, probably from BULLENHUSERDAMM. There were probably
40/50 corpses and I was told by Obersturmfuhrer THUMANN that for the time
being the bodies were not to be burned. I rode off on a bicycle to the
Crematorium and found that in the meantime they had already begun with the
cremating. I rode back and reported to THUMANN. THUMANN then spoke to
Dr. TZREBINSKI and it was decided that the bodies were to be cremated.
I then rode back to the crematorium and told the prisoners that they could
proceed. The prisoners told me that there were about 20 children amongst
these corpses.

1.	The existence and movement of a B.M,, unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—

quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a

3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(a)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(b)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in

17, Sv/orn before Capt. S.R. Hurrell, R.A. , of War Crimes Investigation Unit
B.h.O.R. , at Hildesheim, on the 15th day of May, 1946*
I was arrested in late 1939 as a Political Prisoner, and after being
in about 14 Concentration Camps I was sent from Belsen Concentration Camp
to Hildesheim about the beginning of March 1945 for bomb clearance work.
There were about 500 political prisoners employed here on this work
including, French, Belgians, Italians, Greeks, Hungarians and Poles.
\7e travelled, to Hildesheim in open trucks, the journey taking about
17 days, during which time we had one meal issued to us and no water
allowed. About 40 per cent of the prisoners died of hunger on the journey.
It snowed, and rained., and we had no blankets and warm clothing. These were
the circumstances in which we arrived at Hildesheim.
We were put to work the following morning in the railway goods station.
Our work was carrying sleepers and laying new rails, and after bombing
attacks unloading burning waggons, which we had. to do after our normal
12 hours work per day.
The Guards treated us as though we were responsible for the a.ir raids.
The most brutal of all the Guards was DETTMAR, who took every opportunity
of beating the weakened prisoners in the most frightful way. He normally
used a heavy 'wooden stick about one metre long.
I remember the case of a Hungarian who I saw beaten about a week after
our arrival. DETTMAR beat this man with his heavy stick all over his head,
and body for about 2 or 3 minutes until the man collapsed. He had, to be
carried away by other prisoners, and given medical attention by the Prison
Doctor. He was unable to work for a number of days.
I myself have seen about 30 to 4O prisoners beaten by DETTMAR with
this stick during a period of about 3 weeks, after which I was returned
via Ahlem to Belsen Concentration Camp. Always the prisoners was beaten
until they collapsed, r.nd in most cases they had to be carried away and to
receive medical attention. Most of the Prisoners so beaten 'were Poles
and Hungarians.

I was arrested in December 1939 as a Jew, and after being in about 13
or 14 Concentration Camps I was transferred from Belsen Concentration Camp

About 500 Political Prisoners arrived at Hildesheim in this transport.
They included French, Belgians, Dutch, Hungarians, Czechs, Poles, Itali
and Rumanians. All the prisoners were in a very weak condition, hav^rg had
nothing to eat except one loaf of bread and no water to drink, during th
days journey. About 140 men were in each truck. Many died. the journ y

Yfe were put to work the following morning, repairing railway lines and
filling in bomb craters, all very heavy work, for about 11 hours each /•
In addition we had to unload burning railway trucks after air raids.
DETTMAR was a Guard in charge of about 100 prisoners doing repair
at the Railway Station. He always carried a stick about ^e metre long
5 cms. thick which he frequently used on the prisoners. He also carried a
rifle with which he used to threaten to shoot the prisoners and also strike
them with the butt.
I remember seeing a Rumanian Doctor who I was assisting to pull ahorse

Camp to Kildesheim arriving about the 1st or 2nd March 194-5. All the
Prisoners were in a very bad state of health when we arrived. We were
set to work in the Railway Station at Hildesheim clearing up after bonibing,
shifting damaged railway trucks and lines.
I remember the Volkstum Guard Leader EETTMAR. He always carried a
heavy stick with which he used to beat the Prisoners.
One morning in March 194-5 i was working at the Railway Station in company
with a Dr. ROSENBAUER (or some such name) who was either a Jugo-Slav or a
Hungarian. DETTMAR came along and looked at the amount of earth on the
shovel ROSENBAUER was using. He immediately commenced to beat ROSEWBAUER with
his stick on his head and shoulders about 10 to 15 blows, ROSENBAUER fell to
the ground unconscious, and another Volksturm Guard then came along and told
me to get this man carried to his quarters. Pour of us carried him to the
Camp where he was attended by Dr. Deutsch and Dr. Mandel. The first has now
returned to Rumania, and the second is dead. One of these Drs, told me 2 or
3 days later that ROSENBAUTER had died. He was probably buried in the Jewish
Cemetry at Hildesheim.
During the 3 weeks we were at Hildesheim, I have myself seen DETTMAR
strike prisoners with his stick on about 20 occasions. Usually he gave them
5 to 10 blows over the head and shoulders. I have seen Hungarian, Rumanian,
Greek, French, Italian, Polish and Jugo-Slav Prisoners beaten by DETTMAR in
this way.

I vi&s arrested as a Political Prisoner in 194-2, I was one of a
transport of about 500 prisoners sent from Belsen Concentration Canp to
Hildesheim, arriving there about the 4-th March 194-5,
We were set to work clearing bomb damage at the Railway Station. There
was a Volkstum Guard Leader in charge of about 6 Volksturm Guards who was the
only one who beat the Prisoners frequently. I do not know his name but
I would recognise him. I would describe him as about 4-8 years of age, about
163 cms. tall, thin light brown hair, round face, reddish complexion, well
built. He dragged one foot in walking.
We were working in Hildensheim Railway Station for 3 weeks. During this
time, I myself saw this Guard Leader beat at least 20 prisoners every day
with his stick. Usually he gave them about 5 to 10 blow© on their heads and
shoulders, and usually they fell to the ground. I have seen Hungarian, Rumanian,
Polish, and French Prisoners beaten by this Guard Leader in this way,
I remember the case of one Italian Prisoner with whom I was working.
I heard him tell this Guard Leader that he was an Italian Officer Prisoner of
War, and that he refused to work. This Guard Leader immediately commenced
to beat the Italian with his stick, I saw him give the Italian about 4O to
50 blows with his stick on his head and shoulders and all over his body.
At the end the Italian was lying on the ground unconscious. He was
unconscious for about three quarters of an hour.

Quarter 22, Sworn before Captain Sidney Reginald
HURRELL, R.A. of War Crimes Investigation Unit,
B.A.O.R., at Hohne Camp on the 2lst day of May , 1946.
I was arrested in Poland in 1941 as a jew, and subsequently sent
to Auschwitz Concentration Camp.in 1944. I was one of a transport of
about 500 prisoners sent from Belsen Concentration Camp to Holdesheirn
arriving about March 1945.
At Hildesheim we were put to work at the Railway Station re-laying
railway lines and clearing bomb damage.
I well remember one of the Volksturm Guards who we called "Leather
Jacket". I do not know his name, but I would recognise him. I would describe
him as about 40 years of age, about 175 cms. tall, fair hair, round face,
reddish-brown complexion, snub nose, well built, I have myself been beaten by
this man.
At about 10 o’clock one morning, about 2 weeks after we arrived at
Hildesheim, I was one of a party of about 10 prisoners moving rails. Because
we could not move one of the rails "Leather Jacket" cane along and beat each
one of us with the butt of his rifle. I myself received about 5 or 6 hard
blows with this in my back. I should have been knocked over if I had not
clung to a rail. "Leather Jacket" held the rifle barrel in both hands and
jabbed me with the butt with his full strength. All the other men of the
party were struck in the sane way. They all received at least 5 or 6 blows,
some of then as many as 10 blows. About 4 of then were knocked down,. These
prisoners were about 8 Hungarians and one other Pole.
On another occasion I saw "Leather Jacket" beat the sane Pole with a
rubber truncheon on the Roll call Parade when the Pole tried to move to
another party of Prisoners. He hit the Pole over his head, shoulders and back
about 20 blows, until the Pole fell to the ground unconscious The "Leather
Jacket xicked this Pole 4 or 5 times, and then ordered 2 other men to carry
him to the billet. This Pole's name is SZTERNBERG (or something like that)
and he lives in this Camp.
On another occasion I saw 2 Hungarians beaten by "Leather Jacket"
with a rubber truncheon. This happened at the Railway Station, when "Leather
Jacket saw them eating from a tin which they had picked up from near a bombed
railway coach. He beat one of them over the head shoulders and body about 15
to 20 blows until the man fell to the ground* Then he kicked the man 3 or 4
tines until the man got up again. Then the second Hunga.rian was beaten and
kicked, in exactly the same manner. Then they had to start work a.gainj and
1	saw "Leather Jacket" give each of them an additional 3 or 4 blows with his
rubber truncheon to make them work harder.
In addition I have seen "Leather Jacket" beat with a stick a. rubber
truncheon, or his rifle, between 5 and 10 men eveiy day during the period of
2	to 3 weeks we were working at Hildesheim Railway Station. Always he gave
at least 3 or 4 blows. They were all Hungarian or Polish Prisoners.
I speak German and can fully understand this Statement.

of March 1945 I was at Hildeshein Goods Railway Station. Six of
these days I was on duty guarding Prisoners wording on bonb damage
in the Railway Goods Station. I went also on about 6 occasions to the
Station where the Prisoners were wondLng when I was not on duty.
Most days I used to wear a Leather Jacket. I do not rsaenber any of

On the day the Prisoners arrived ZugFuhrer ROUSSIN gave all
the Guards Orders that if the Prisoners started to loot or refused
to worJc we should. naJce use of our arms, and we were each given 10

Unregistered
Reference Number of
Originating Branch.
Subject.
NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—-165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other prehminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(a) By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(b) By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4. The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

On many occasions v/hcn I visited the camps together with GRIEM X have
scon that he bca.t and maltreated the prisonerso On several occasions
prisoners, of whom only a few were Gormans, were illtrc-ated to such an
extent that they had to be carried into the hospital. I am sure, that at
least 50 people died owing to the beating of Oberstumfuhror GRIEMo
Moreover GRIEM has stolen food of the prisoners.
While' he was at I\WENGiU.%iE and before he was transferred to HUSUM GRIEM
was very brutal towards the prisoners, he caused sufferings and hardships
to all prisoners under his command. On some occasions GRIEM fired his pistol
into a group of prisoners and wounded many. I know that a Pole died owing
to such shooting.
The Kapos caused much trouble towards the prisoners. The worst Kapo
was \7illi SCHNEIDER, a criminal from DORTMUND. His two main, assistants
were Martin TENZ and Willi DEHMERT. SCHNEIDER was responsible for the
passing on of the orders of the SS.
Most of the time the prisoners had to work 10 hours daily, they had to
dig ditches. The meals consisted of: ■§• litre of coffee in the morning,
550 grams of bread and 10 grams of margarine at midday, and vegetable soup
in the evening. These conditions were about the same, in all the cam|ps.
During the months November and December 1944 about 500 prisoners died
at LADELUND and were buried there. I can identify the place. They died
owing to overwork and under-nourishment and by the beatings they received
from the overseers and the Kapos. The 3 Kapos I mentioned already were.the
worst, they forced the prisoners to work faster and beat them with sticks
and truncheons. In this way they received extra rations and cigarettps from
the SS. Moreover they stole things from the prisoners which they sold to
civilians.
Besides the prisoners, who died at MDELIMD, several hundred died at
HUSUM, and I suppose about 500 at DALUM.

Deposition on oath of Paul ij.age Jons Thygesen, male, of Copenhagen,
Middelfartgade 10, sworn before Ronald Walter ROSE, Capt. Essex Regir.ient,
No 2 War Cranes Investigation Team, at COiENHaGEN, on March 16, 1946.
I am 32 years old of Danish nationality, born in COPENHAGEN, I am at
present living at Middelf artgade 10, COPENHAGEN, which is my permanent home.
I was arrested by the Gestapo in COPENHAGEN on the 2nd August 1944, because
of illegal activity against the Nazis. I was interned in DENMARK: until
15th September 1944, when I v<as transferred to the Concentration Camp
NEUENG4MME, near HAMBURG. Qu 25th September I was sent to the labour camp
at SCHSESING near HUSUM. The SCHlESING oamp closed down during the last
days, of December 44, and I wias sent back to NEUENGAMME. At the beginning
of January ,1945 I was transferred to a labour camp at DALIM near MEFEEN.
nt the end of March 1945 T was returned to NEUENGAMME, and in April I was
transferred to a Danish- Internment camp'by arrangement with the Swedish
Red-Gross.
During the whole time that the HUSUM labour camp existed as an Aussenkommando
of NBUENGAMME concentration camp, 1 was there. My prisoner number was
D 50540, and I functioned as a camp doctor. The prisoners at the camp had
to dig tank-traps in ground that was extremely swampy and marshy. As
far as 1 know the prisoners sometimes worked as far as 12 km from the camp.
When we arrived at the camp there were about 1000 prisoners, which was the
average number. During the period just before the opening cf the LADELUND
camp we 'were about 2000 strong.
In my opinion the normal capacity of the camp was only about 40Q people.
During the 3 months that the camp existed there were about 3 transports of
sick people to NEUENGAMME. (300, 300, 150). New transports from NEUENGAMME
replaced the sick, so that the number remained constantly at about 1000,
except for a period before the end when nobody came. Most of the prisoners
were Dutch, other representative nationalities were Russian, polish, German,
Belgian, French, Danish, Jugoslavian, Spanish, Italian and as far as I
remember one Greek.
The appearance of the camp, the number of barracks, the approximate size,
is shown by a map, I have drawn from memory after my return home. The map is
to be found in a book called "Danes in Gorman-Concentration camps",
published by GILDENDAL in 1945.
The living rooms were filled with double-tier-beds, only separated by a
very narrow gangway. There were 2 prisoners and sometimes more on each bed.
Each bed had a very poor paper mattress, which did not even fill up the
whole bed. These mattresses wore out very quickly, so that the straw fell
out. a largo number of the jxrisoners - I think most of them - had diarrhoea
and had to go out very often at night, and as it was a very long way to the
toilet, the conditions were unbearably filthy, but it was not because
prisoners were lazy or unhygienic. They were too weak to get out of their
beds and climb over ten or twelve of their comrades, which it would
have been necessary to do.
We arrived at the camp in clothes, which had been issued to us at the
NEUEGAMME Camp. They were striped prison-clothes, jacket, trousers and a
very thin coat. We also had one pair of pants and a shirt. These clothes
were useless for keeping us warm, they were very poor and looked as if they
had been worn by other prisoners before. The various categories of senior-
prisoners were always better equipped.﻿- 2 -	C
The nost catastrophic thing about the clothing was the footwear, only a
xew had stockings, others has rags wrapped around their feet, and sone had
• absolutely.nothing.
-lost of the boots were made of wood with ccmvas uppers. Others had only a
pair of overshoes with holes in, and odd shoes with defective soles. There
were no facilities for repairing shoes, but it was actually of no importance,
as there was a cobbler's shop, but no material, with which to make the repairs.
I must add that almost all the kapos had long leather boots, and could always
have been repaired.
The prisoners worked most of the time in water, and as the footv^ear was so
ad and seldom fitted, in my opinion it was directly responsible far a
great number of the deaths. The prisoners invariably gpi blisters on their
feet, is their were no facilities for washing or keeping clean, in most
cases the blisters become septic. Qwing to lack of powers of resistence,
a generally caused abscesses and phlegmonia - often resulting in death,
there was no way in which the doctors could help them.
In oot the striped prison clothes had to be.handed in, and instead the
prisoners got some old ~ originally civilian- clothes of a still worse
quality, painted with the usual yellow crosses, yet the overcoats we
received were, on the whole, of a better quality than the striped coats,
I am almost convinced that the prisoners got no extra underwear for the wdnter,
and i know positively that a great number of; the prisoners have born the
same underwear for 3 months yjithout having the; opportunity to have it washed,
partly there was no time as they worked 12 hours on week-days and Sundays,
and partly there was no hot water and only periodically a small piece of
loamy soap, which was of no praetical value.
During the first 14 days of the camp none of the. prisoners had soap, in the
hospital at least one week passed, before the doctors were very graciously
given a piece of soap for common; use. it that time there were no towels
either.. Later we had some miserable rags.
tfc the food the.daily bread ration consisted of 250 grams bad rye bread,
the contents of which in ny opinion to a great extent consisted of potato
meal. The food content of it was in any case far less than that of the
usual rye bread. Now and then we also got a small pat of synthetic margarine -
enough to cover one to two sldces of bread. Sometimes a spoonful of marmalade
or a snail slice of miserable sausage made of refuse products, often in the
iorm of a blaok pudding. Once i found a dog's topth in a sausage.
In the evenings each'person got one litre of .turnip soup. At first cabbage
and potatoes were sometimes in the soup, but most,of the time the turnips
were the only ingredients.
The usual recipe for such a soup is said to have been (as far as i remember —
it was information from the kitchen in NEUENG4MME):
2000 litre of water,
38 kg meat, that is to say waste-meat, such as
udder, lungs, horse nuzzle >_tc., and turnips.
Once a week the prisoners got five or six half-tainted potatoes, which they
had to peel.
The food was completely insufficient as to the calories and to the mixture
of necessary materials such as protein, vitamins etc. It is impossible
for me to give the Contents of calories in the food, but it must not be
forgotten that a very large number of the prisoners could not at all
utilize the food they got owing to indigestion.
nt any rate the quality and quantity of the food was in a flagrant
disproportion to the manual work, which the prisoners had to do. ks an
illustration of the prisoners' hunger the following episode may be
mentioned.﻿Tho soup was fetched froru the kitchen in containers, which could hold 50
litres. Sometimes it happened that the containers were upset, and at least
twice I have seen-a cluster of prisoners go down on their knees and lap up
the food from the ground.
After working hours dunghills and rubbish-heaps of potatoes and turnips were
covered with searching and digging prisoners.
Once i witnessed that a Russian oat tho vomit of a Dutchman.
Sometimes a special diet w/as prepared for the patients suffering from
diarrhea, usually boiled macaroni, but in so small quantitities that not
even 1/10 of the need was covered. During a very short period we obtained a
few slices of whiter bread for those who suffered most severely. But ai^y
proper diet-treatment in a medical sense never came into question at ary
time in spite, of repeated requests to the camp leaders from the doctors.
As eating utensils the prisoners had a tin or oarthem cup and a spoon.
There were no- knives or forks.
There were no tables or chairs-in the barracks where- the prisoners oould
eat. They took their meals standing, or lying on their beds.
Besides the above mentioned thingfe the prisoners received ^ to ^ litre of a
somewhat cold, brown liquid (coffee substitute) each morning.
As to the medical working conditions I can summarize as follows:
Among the first transport of prisoners from	to HUSIM were two
doctors, my Danish colleague Knud NORDENTOFT from yarde and I. Knud
NOHDENTOST died in November of a severe enteritis. Among a later transport
arriving from NEUENGAMLIE were two -French doctors who were not allowed to act
as doctors until a considerable time later on, however, -when all the most „
severely ill persons had been sent back to MUENGAMME. The reason was that
only one doctor and one medical orderly might bo on the list sent to
NEUENGtl/fi/iE. I approached the Caiap leader, S3 Untersturmfuehrer GRIEM, several
times and asked for help for the-hospital because ny work was overwhelming,
but I did not get the help almost right up to the end. I know that one of the
French doctors is alive. His name is Dr. clement MAROT, boulevard Montparnasse
146, PARIS, During a short period Dr„ MAROT acted as a doctor in the LAEELUND-
Camp, and later he worked together viith me in the DiJMM-Camp. I am convinced
that mary people's lives might have been saved in the HUSUM-Canp if we had
been allowed to profit by his considerable capacity for work and eminent
professional qualifications.
Originally the doctors had two rooms in the last of the- ordinary prisoner's
barracks, a so-called consulting room (which wias also used by the personnel
of the oamp office as a dining and sleeping room), and :a room used as a
, .hospital filled with double-tier-beds.
By the way, the rooms did not differ from the others of the camp - decayed
and impossible to keep clean. There were no floor cloths, and as
to brooms we only had some bundles of branches which we xaade ourselves.
The doctors' duties vxere at first especially multifarious; We had to
clean the hospital ourselves and sweep the street outside. We had to wash
the corpses and make the coffins - during the short time these were used.
V/e had to feed the patients and empty their privy pails. There were not
lavatories in the barracks, so the patients in bed had to use an' empty
marmalade jar.
On our arrival at the camp we did not receive more medicine than could be
held in a shoe-box, and in addition we had a similar quantity of dressing-
materials. At first we had no instruments at all, later on I got a blunt
knife, a pair of scissors, and as far-as I remember two pairs of "tweezers -
For instance I was compelled to make large cuts in inflamed tissues with a
razor-blade - without narcotization - and I also amputated without aiy﻿- 4 -
1
narcotization e. finger with a razor blade and a pair of pincers as the only
instruments. Not until 14 days before the camp closed down (after ^ of the
prisoners had died and 750 seriously ill people had been sent to NEDENQnMME
did we get a large parcel (officially for 4000 marks) with medicine, dressing
materials, and instruments (l suppose from a drug'-storo in FLENSBURG). ...n
S3 Untcrsoharfuehrer from NEUEN&M'iE managed this.
Before that time we only had our'reserves (or rather lack of reserves)
supplemented by two or three ridiculously small and practically unimportant
supplies from NBUENG4MIE and the local drug-store in HUSIM.
Later on we profited by the last big parcel of medicine after we had been
transferred to DnLUM.
The hospital was full up after a few days, and it had constantly to be
extended, in a short time (less than a month) the hospital had to be extended
to a whole barracks; six rooms. Afterwards it included six cf the nine
barracks of the comp, there.were over 700 in the hospital, and as. I mostly
had to do the work all by myself, you will understand how. illusory the medical
attendance was.
Towards the end a. number of sick persons were transferred from the MKLUND-
Canp to the HUSIM-Camp. it was in December 1944. Dr. MAR0T accompanied them
and. acted at that time ,as .a doctor in the camp.
It is impossible for me to state exactly what we had at our disposal of the
various medicines at different times, but at any rate it was not enough for
the most elementary medical attention for only a few cf the sick prisoners.
As examples I may mention;
¥e only had sulphanomide during short periods and in quite insufficient
quantities. I was several times in the position that I had to select two
or three patients among several persons suffering from pneumonia and content
myself with giving then the medicine.
When a short epidemic of diphtheria broke out, I went to Unterscharfuehrer
G-RIEM at once and asked for vaccine and serum and informed him of the
dangerous situation which might arise. About a month later I received diphtheria
serum in such quantities that I could treat a two years child suffering from
slight diphtheria.
There was a catastrophic lack of disinfectants which was worse because it was
nearly impossible to sterilize the few instruments we had at our disposal.
Some alcohol which arrived in a parcel together v<ith some cf the medicine
was confiscated by Uiitersturmfuehror GRIEM who examined the parcel.
I have several times seen him drunk in the Camp.
The lack of dressing materials v<as also catastrophic, and they consisted
almost exclusively cf paper vdiich, of course, was of little value, as the
paper was dissolved when the prisoner worked the whole day with their feet
in water.
Sometimes we cut up our own shirts and sowed them up into strips, which,
however, was characterized as "sabotage" by G-RIEM.
At times we pasted trips of paper together with flour paste which we made
ourselves of flour from the kitohon.
Repeatedly I pointed out to GRIEM that the lack of dressing materials and
medicine was catastrophic, and prevented us from giving any proper medical
attention.
The results of these applications were diminutive. I dare not give any
opinion whether it was possible for the camp leader to get the wanted
medicine and dressing materials. I am under the impression .that GRIM was﻿not very much interested in this natter,
^11 kinds of laboratory examinations - even a common urine analysis - were
impossible because we did not succeed in getting a single test tube of
the most common analysis liquids in spite of repeated'requests.
In HUSUM I tried to keep a sort of statistical check of sickness and mortality
rates. Most of.ny notes were lost, because it was forbidden to take notes
from one camp to another. When fie were transferred to NEUEN&ilOIE, we were
completely stripped and deprived of all papers. I succeeded in smuggling
in a few papers which had been hidden in ny. rectum. Below you will find
a copy of one of the reports which I had to make in the HUS'UM camp every
month, it was written at the time when there were about 1,000 prisoners
in the camp, and the’Dutchman NkW de BOER, Vinkeveen, Qroenlandschekade,
Holland, will, I suppose! be able to confirm it, It that time he acted as
a kind of "Sanifaeter" in the damp, and he helped me to make the reports.
Nn.N de BOER.will undoubtedly also be able to confirm' most of the
information concerning the conditions in the hospital, which this report
deals with.	^
Labour Camp HUSUMj 25-th Nov. 44
There are 734 siok prisoners in the hospital.
Specification:
I.	Intestinal Disease's: 125
1)	45 serious cases of blood diarrhoea, which cannot
be expected to'be cured for the present, and a great part cf
may be expected not to be cured at all.
2)	80 cases of common serious to very serious diarrhoea which
may be cured in 14 days or a.month (several prisoners with less
serious diarrhoeas work in working parties or suffer from
other diseases, which are worse than intestinal diseases).
II.	Other medical illnossos; 139
1)	12 cases of pneumonia
6 cases of pleurisy
6 cases of cystitis and inflammation of the kidney basin
4 oases of inflammation of the kidneys
11 patients -probably suffering from heart diseases. •
2	cases of gout fevor
3	oases of gastric ulcer
9 cases of -INSIG-TSROSE (inflammation of the skin of the face)
1 case of inflammation of the gall bladder
1 case cf inflammation of tho veins
4	cases of diphtheria
6 patients probably suffering from consumption
9. patients suffering from serious edeiiias
None of the patients can for tho present be expected
to be .fit for work.
2)	35 cases of com.on exhaustion and loss of weight -
not fit for work.
3)	30 cases of common fever diseases. These patients may
probably be fit for work in about 14 days.
Besides there are severe! cases' of common rheumatism,
less severe edemas, and mary cases cf inflammation of the mucus
of the mouth with bleeding, probably caused by lack of vitamins,
iill these patients work,
III. Skin diseases: 470
1)	242 serious cases with phiegmonia, abscesses, wide
and deep wounds etc,, and these patients will on no
account be able to work for the present, and a very﻿V

great number of them will die. Amputation would
r	in mai^y oases bfe the rational, treatment, but cannot
be carried out owing to the lack of instruments and
•	dressing materials.
2)228 oases of less serious skin diseases. A part of these
patients may be able to go to wbrk again after about 14 days
of rest and skin treatment.
The dysentaiy epidemic proper seems, to have culminated
for the present. Nev< cases of diphtheria have not been
reported during the last 14 days, on the other hand the number
of illnesses due to colds, other medical illnesses, and
cases of common exhaustion increases constatnly.
The long and in many cases ineffective skin;-.treatment is due
to-the lack of dressing materials, ointments, and disinfectants,
and the insufficient food caused by the war'.
During the last month 188 patients have died;

Owing to.the lack of diagnostical remedies, the medical diagnoses were based
bn clinical estimation, the value of vdiich was veiy problematic because the
treatment could only seldom be based on it. I certainly dare say that the
proportion between the various diseases in' the report in all essentials is
in accordance with the facts, and that the total number of sick persons
is fully correct. The reports have partly been given to G-RIEM and partly
to an SS Sanitaetsunterscharfuehrer who once or twice cane from KEUENCAJME
for inspection.
^s you will see from the report the greater part of the patients suffered
from wounds on the legs and from what is the consequence of such diseases.
I have already mentioned before that the quality of the shoes is the direct
cause in conjunction with a-lowered vitality due to undernourishment in
the tissues and the organism-on the whole. I. may add;
There was positively none of the: ordinary prisoners who had not had
festering wounds on his feet and legs at some time. Most of the prisoners
suffered from this disease all the time.
Another great scourge in the camp v^ias the ddsrrhoea. ^t some time we all
suffered from diarrhoea, certainly due to an infection of the bowels in
conjunction with the lack of vitamins.
The most seriously sick persons ran 20 to 30 tines to the lavatories, and
sometimes they made a ness in their trousers.
A rational treatment of those bowel diseases was excluded. In vain I
tried to isolate these patients in special "shit-rooms". There were
double-tier-beds, and,two patients in each bed, and they ceaselessly had to
relieve themselves, but many times the faeces only consisted of water, blood,
and-mucus. To spare them the run to the lavatories there v;ere empty
jam-hars in the rooms. They were emptied several times during the dry, but
in spite of this they frequently ran over, or were upset on the floor.
The stink was beyond description. Mattresses and blankets were completely
wet or stiff owing to the faeces, from the patients who had occupied the
bed before, and often the-faeces ran from the upper tier down through the
boards to the lower bed. I think most of the patients had the will to
try to reach the jam-jars, and 1 have se'en them jump down from the second
tier and run with one or two fingers in the rectum'as a stopper, while water
and blood squirted in all directions, as when you stop the water pouring
out from a tap with your finger.﻿4
Untersturrfuchror GRIM and thu other SS non in the conp knew those things,
for sonctinos thqjr inspected the hospital, and conplaint of tho conditions.
During the last tine wo very saldon saw GRira.i' in the hospital, because, as
ho had told no hiroself, he was afraid cf being infected*'
'■ ^ couple of tiraes a civilian doctor froa mjSUi.i inspected tho camp. Later
I learned that his none was RJvDKENS.
I can given tho following information concerning hir.i;
I have soon hin and talked to hin two or throe times in the camp# My iipression
is that he was medical officer in HUSIM, and as such ho should issue the
cortificatos of death in order that the corpses could be buried in the local
churchyard in HUSUM. *.t no tine he has done ary real medical work in the
camp, and his visits were very brief. Together with me and camp leader he
inspected the hospital, and he must have received s. shocking impression of
the conditions under which the patients (and the prisoners on the whole)
lived, Re must also have received a strong impression of our great lack of
medicine and other medical remedies.:
On his visits he always wore his party badge being a member of the NSD1P*,
and always maintained a kind attitude towards the SS chief of the camp. He
was always kind to me, and at any rate he expressed to mo that he understood
ny difficult position as a doctor,
nfter one. of his visits .at the camp, at any nate, we received from one of
the drug-stores in HUSIM a small portion cf medicine, the quantity of which
was so small, however, that it was of no real importance. I cannot say
whether he should have been able to get hold of larger quantities.
Concerning the mortality in the camp, i can say that at least 200 prisoners
died in the HUSUM.Camp during- the three months, it existed, but I suppose
^hdt; the number has rather been 250, , ^he correct number can be obtained
from the caretaker of the local churchyard in HU3UM where the corpses have
been buried, on inquiring at the hospital after my return to HEUEMGxi4lE I
. estimated that at least 100 of the sick persons who were sent from HUSUM
to MEUENGMKE on sick-transport died almost immediately af ter their arrival
at NEUENGil/ME. I know that a part of then died whilst being transported.
Tnere is no doubt that these prisoners have died as a direct consequence of
their stay in the HUSUM-Camp.
The above mentioned figures are the minimum.
Summing up the reasons for the large sickness and mortality rate, I will
mention:
Systematic starvation - miserable clothes, extremely bad> shoes — constant
exposure to ill-treatment, the strong psychical pressure which constantly
weighed upon the prisoners, the terrible housing conditions with the cat-
astrophic crowding of the prisoners and consequently a great larger of infec-
tion, hard labour, the hardness and tho conditions of which were in glaring
misproportion to the food and the prisoners' physique and working capacity -
and above allj the camp leaders' complete incompetence and lack of respect
for the most.elementaiy human necessities and cohditions of life.
Consultations of the out-patients started at 5 to 5*30 a.n. and was finished
at about 6,30 o'clock, ‘when the work started. Rt that moment there was always
a long queue of prisoners outside the consultation-roor.i 'who had not yet been
treated. They were turned away by the SS men, no matter what was their
trouble. Especially.blockloader KLINGLER was active on these occasions.
Several times I have seen hin turn away seriously ill prisoners standing
in the queue outside the consulting-room, by blows with a stick. The
consultations in the evening started when the prisoners returned from their
work, usually at about 7 P»n. and were not finished until tho last man in
queue had been treated — sometimes not till midnight — at ary rate never
till lo - 11 o'clock. 1 Sometimes the consultations in the evenings could﻿- 8 -
¥
not take place because of electricity restrictions owinc to shortage of coal*
Of coufse, as the hospital expanded to such a large extent, it needed assistanpe,
but owing to the reports to NETOKUMS on the number of prisoners working, only
one doctor and one "Sanitaeter" night be in the camp. Therefore al], help had
to be organized illegally, which happened in the following way* I did not discharge
the well-qualified patients who had recovered, but kept' then as nale nurses for
their comrades.
\,e had to conceal these people fron the S3 nen, and several tines they had to
rush to their beds amid their work when G-RIEii or other S3 men approached the
hospital.	«
Several times G-RIEM made raids on the hospital, and.he himself discharged the
patients for work) whom he did not find sick enough regardless of the medical
report*
By these forced discharges of less sick prisoners, we were placed in,a
catastrophic position, as we lost all our assistants..
4iS a rule there was a number of constantly seriously ill persons in the (camp■
whom l tried to spare the .work in the tankditch by means of special, ■medical
chitties, the number of which had to be kept down to a minimum to evado reprisals
from the camp leader. These convalescent patients worked the whole day peeling
potatoes or turnips, or thqy cleaned up the pomp", for instanoo they emptied the
lavatory.
One day G-RIEM found out that the number of medical chitties was too high, and he
told me that this was sabotage against Germany’s "total war efforts". All
patients who could not show an open large wound or something like that, were
ordered to work. There were among them several elderly prisoners, 50 to 60
years old, partly suffering from for example serious hard or lung diseases, and
I tried to make GRIEM understand this. As it did not influence his decision,
I emphasized that several of them would be brought back dead in the evening.
That evening 6 prisoners 'were brought back dead.
These transport of dead or dying persons were a thing which happened frequently.
Several times two to four prisoners were carried hone, who owing to Illness or
exhaustion had collapsed at their Working places, and then died of exposure.
Once it also happened that a prisoner fell down dead,* immediately after the
shifts had paraded in the morning. His comrades took him with then to the
tenkditch and home again in order that the numbers of the prisoners at the
parade could be correct.
On the whole it was fcharactoristic of GRIEM's diagnosis - both in HUSUM and
DnLUM - that if tho patient could not show large open wounds, boils, or
something like that, he was called a malingerer and discharged for work.
^.s to the treatment of the dead,, x can give the' following information;
Only at first coffins were used, vi/hich the carpenter of the camp made of waste
wood. Sometimes we put th^ee corpses in such a coffin. When the material ran
short, paper bags were used, and when they also ran short, the corpses were
buried naked, x have also seen that coffins were used for tho transportation
of the dead but thqy were not placed in the graves.
The corpses were buried in a mdss grave in a’corner of the local churchyard
in HUSUM, 30 or 40 corpses in each graVo, and in 3 to 5 layers. j,s far as I
remember, there were 12 of these graves in the churchyard.
The corpses- were taken to the' churchyard on a open horsedrawn carriage, and’
sometimes the corpses fell off during the ride, because they had boon piled
up too high.
Before the burial took place, corpses were usually collected in a snail shed
in the camp, where they lay in several layers. A week might elapse, before﻿- 9 -

tho burial took place, and theroforo the corpses -sere in on advanced state
of decomposition. I njysclf have seen some corpses ill-treated by rats*
I know that once a couple of prisoners, -who had coiUiiittod some offence, were
locked up during the night in this mortuary together with the corpses. There
was only so much room left that they could stand or perhaps just sit down on
the floor.
Both in HUSUM and n. TIM I treated several prisoners for shot wounds.*
-5 prisoners, at any rate, were shot while trying to escape.
One prisoner was killed while trying to steal potatoes from the store of the
HUSIM-camp.
One prisoner was brought back from the working place with a shot wound in his
stomach, Ifter that he lived on for about one week in the hospital.
I witnessed the following episode nyself:
Orcein HUSUM the prisoners did not parade quickly enough, and GRIEM shot v<ith
his revolver at the building where the. potatoes wero peeled, and thereby one pole
was wounded in the forearm, and a- Dutchman was wounded in the groin. None of
them died as a direct consequence of the wounds. I do not know Yihat happened
to them later on.
In DALUE two Russians were killed while trying to escape, is a bogey they Tiers
placed on the ground at!the entrance of the camp next day so that the prisoners,
when they came home from the working places, had to march one by one past then.
Some of the Russians saluted their dead.comrades by taking off their hats as they
passed by.
The two Kapoes MARTIN TENG- and Willy SCHNEIDER, who watched the march past,
began to beat the prisoners with clenched fists, in their faces,
because of these demonstrations,
I personally witnessed these incidents, and it can be donfirmed by the above-
mentioned NAN <le BOER from Holland and several other prisoners.
As to the sanitary conditions in the camp, I can give the following information:
the lavatories, dirty beyond description, were separated from the barracks where
the sleeping rooms were. The lavatories had been erected over big pits with
outlets unable to take tho contents of the lavatories, which were full to
overflowing, which was partly due to overcrowding in the camp and partly due to
the fact that the prisoners, as mentioned before, nearly all suffered from
bowel diseases, and had diarrhoea several times a day.
The mixture of urine, vomit and faeces sometimes flowed on the ground behind the
barracks.
The stink was often insufferable.
I have seen some rats in the camp, but there had never been a real rat>
plague.	-	•	’	.	.
During the first time there were no lice in the camp, because wo had been
deloused thoroughly in NEUENGAMME.
After a number of sick persons had been transferred from LADELUND to HUSUM»
the lice spread, but shortly afterwards the camp closed down.
There were some cases of the itch.﻿10 -
*
Oonpctred -with this I can state that in IULUM practically all suffered
frail' lice and that at least 2/3 cf the prisoners had scabies.
dpart fron these insect plagues, the hygienic conditions were, after all better
than in, HUSUM.
The supply cf drinking water was in try opinion all right. The water was
brought to the camp through pipes from outside.
On the other hand the prisoners had snail chances of keeping themselves and
their clothes clean, because cf the above-mentioned lack of soap (which, when
we could get it, was cf a poor quality, almost like loom) and towels apart
from the fact that the work was so hard that the prisoners had no time
or strength for thorough cleanliness when they came hone in the evenings
Host of them slept in their beds with their clothes on, and I know that
several.of them have had no opportunity to change their underwear during the
3 months the camp existed.
Most of the rooms of the camp could not be heated either., partly owing to lack
of stoves and the miserable condition of these stoves, and partly because there
was no official allotment of fuel, the prisoners had no opportunity to get their
constantly wet clothes and shoes dried.
In the rooms of the hospital, the possibilities of heating were also very much
limited owing to the reasons mentioned above.
ks a doctor I have .had to dig in the dunghill myself to find fuel.
As to the methods cf punishment, I oan give the following information:
The most frequent reason for punishment was theft.
The prisoners cf ten tried to steal potatoes and. turnips and sometimes other
things from the kitchen, of course this must be cabled unfair towards their
fellow-prisoners, but in my opinion it must be regarded a mere manifestation
•of the instinct of self-preservation with those people whose psychical
qualities were reduced owing to the conditions under ‘which they lived. The
prisoners stole, because they were hungry.
Other reasons for punishment-were that the'blankets had been torn to pieces
t.o:.get underwear and rags for wrapping.
Finally.'.the-reason f or punishment was’httemptacl escape, ,
The main method of punishment was flogging, and the ss-Blockfuehrer KLINGLER
or one of the Kapoes had the authority to cariy it out.
The most lenient punishment was 25 blows on loin and seat, sometimes 50 blows,
which were given with a inoh-thick stick or a piece of a cable, the diameter
of which was a couple of centimeters, and it was about 60 to ~J0 centimetres
long.
In 2 cases I have after such a punishment seen skin and muscles so injured
that the bones of the seat lay bare. Both died' of their wounds, in the
hospital,
I do not know what the prisoners had committed in these 2 cases, or who
punished them.
Besides SS-Blookfuehror ELINGLER I have personally seen Kapo FRANZ (whoso
surname according to what I havo been told Was LEVY) do such punishments.
I have also seen the Kapocs Willy SCHNEIDER, Willy DEMERT, Martin TENZ﻿- 11 ~
eoid Alfred (liSVY?) boat prisoners with a stick or a rubber truncheon (piece of a
cable which they always had in their hands), but I do not remember to have seen
these Kapoes doing the mere methodical punishment (giving the prisoners certain
number of blows).
Once the Danish policeman, hSTRUP, was sent to the hospital vjith a double fracture
of the jaw caused by blows in the face. Kapo FHUZ is said to h^ve done this.
xiSTRUP died one week or 14 days later as it was impossible for him to take any
food. Daily, prisoners came to me, parts of their skin black and blue as a
direct consequence of blows they had got at their working places. It is
impossible for me to sfiy who was guilty in each case and how bad the injury
was, but l am convinced that these corporal punishments in several cases have
contributed to the weakening of the prisoners' power of resistance.
another common method of punishment • beside flogging was that the prisoners after
a theft of turnips and potatoes were placed in the main street of the camp sitting
with knees deeply bent or sitting on the injured buttocks on the top of a cistern
with a potato or a turnip between their teeth and in each of their outstretched
hands. They had to sit in that painful position for hours, and when they were
on the point of collapsing the Kapoes kicked and beat them.
I may add that nearly all the prisoners who wore glasses had these smashed after
some time by blows in the face. I have often been told that Martin TEWZ
was the originator of these blows, but I have not witnessed this nyself, as it
generally happened at the Y<orking places, and I wrorked the whole day in the
camp.
I may add an episode which I personnaly witnessed in DaLUM:
Some prisoners had been sent home by the Kapoes from one of tjhe working places
because they were unable to work. SS-Untersturm fuehrer GRIM and SS-Ober-
scharfuehrer SEIFERT ordered a narrow board to be laid across a water ditch,
about 3 meters wide. The sick persons were ordered to balance over the ditch.
Those who could pass without falling into the water (it was in the month of
February) were not siok enough to be sent to the hospital, and were ordered
to viork again after having been beaten by GRIM personally. Those who fell
into the water might be sent to the hospital. There were two of them.
One of these 2 persons died the next day of pneumonia (from v^hich he may have
suffered before he fell into the water), the other one died a few days later.
Whether the fact that they fell into the water was the direct cause of their
death, I cannot say, at any rate, it helped to ruin the health which was’
already greatly weakened.
I also witnessed, in DjILUM that one day oborscharfuehrer SEIFERT repeatedly
kicked a prisoner in the face. The prisoner had collapsed when the shifts went
out in the morning. Maybe SEIFERT thought that he feigned illness to evade
working. The prisoners had deep bleeding wounds in the face, and some parts
of it were black and blue, but there was no fracture. He died the same day or
the next day. Already before the ill-treatment he was greatly weakened.
As to the transports of sick persons from HJSIM to NEUEMkJvfiffi, I can state that
like the ordinary transports of prisoners they took place in leaky and dirty
cattle wagons with some straw spread over the floor. There were 50 to
60 persons in each wagon - in most cases the scrim sly ill persons with
high fever or large wounds.and phlegmenias had no possibility of lying down.
In mary cases it has been unwarrantable from a doctor's point of view to
send the sick persons on transports, but ewing to the accommodation in
the hospital and the lack of possible treatment I was compelled to do it.
On one of the transports, at a time when GS-Oberfuohror EICHLER acted as
canpleader, more room was provided in the wagons.
In at least two cases I have seen that the corpses of those who had died
after the list of the prisoners who were to be transported had boon made,
wore placed in the wagons among those still alive, because, as the S3 men﻿- 12 -
%
said, these numbers could not be struck off the list.
The number was written with an indelible pencil on the chest of those who were
severely ill so that they could be identified if they were dead on their
arrival at NEUENGJVlME.
I know for certain that several of then died during the transport and that
several died immediately after their arrival at NEUEN&iMffi.,
X pbtained this information when I camo back to NEUENGUOffi nyself,
in the HUSUM-camp the prisoners had'no amusements at all. They wrorked on
week days and holidays, about 12 hours delay.
There was no canteen.
Once pr twice the- prisoners received some cigarettes, in. ny estimation 10 to 20
in all during the three, months the camp existed.
Kapoes and other overseers received a much larger ration of cigarettes, in my
opinion 20 - 30 cigarettes a week.
My own ration of cigarettes as a doctor was also larger than those of the other
prisoners.
I had to try to get the best results in spite of the miserable medical working
conditions by trying to be on as good terms as possible with the SS men and the
Kapoes (especially Martin TENZ and Willy SCHNEIDER), who could do much harm to
the hospital by telling GRIEM, with whom they were on veiy good terms, about
the irregularities whidh happened there (for instance, the abevu-mentioneu
illegal male nurses, smuggling of extra food rations from the kitchpn).
lit Christmas 1944 there were only a few prisoners left in the camp - mostly
sick persons, and it is iqy opinion that Oberscharfuehrer EIGHLER, who acted
as oamp leader, at that time, made an effort to create a little more festive
atmosphere by providing better food, for instance meat on Christmas Day and some
cakes baked in the kitchen.
I have never seen oberscharfuehrer EICHLER beat prisoners, and he was. much more
amenable to my proposals as how to improve the conditions of the patients
than GRIBE. But that meant nothing in reality because the prisoners' health
was at that time generally sapped to such an extent that very drastic measures
had to .be taken to improve .the .,condition's, it is my impression that he tried
to get"'medicine and dressing, materials several times when he was camp leader,
ks far 'as I remember, we received-some insignificant quantities • from the
drug-store in HUSUM, but as above ..mentioned without any real importance.
Concerning details of the various Kapoes' misdeeds I cannot give precise
information in addition to what I hat^e already mentioned, .as I, as said before,
worked in the oamp, and the Kapoes were employed on the various working sites.'
Their conditions of life as to accommodation, clothes and food were much better
than those .of the other prisoners. Ks they took part in the distribution of
food themselves, they could take what they needed.
I can add that I personally and-, my male nurses received a larger quantity of
food than the prisoners generally did, among other reasons, by putting off the
reporting of the dead until the rations had been distributed to the hospital.
In defending myself, I emphasize that-What we did was the only positive work,
in the car.-g., and it was important for our fellow-prisoners' sake that our
capacity for work was maintained as well as it was possible under these
circumstances.	+﻿- 13 -

Oonoerning the ruJjUM-camp I oan say that the conditions on the whole v.ere better.
It is ny ir.rpression that portly the work was not so hard, partly the housing
conditions were better, although the prisoners slept on straw only.
The conditions in the hospital were much better, and, at any rate, we had, in
the beginning, a large store of medicine and dressing materials.
Untersturmfuehror G-RIEM was camp leader here too, assisted by unterschnrfuehrer
SEIFERT, whom I have not personally seen maltreating anybody except as above-
mentioned.
Blockfuehrer KLING-LER was in the DnLUM Camp too, and it is r.y impression that
he did not punish the prisoners as cruelly as in HUSUM.
I have written this report in Danish, which is my native language, and which I
fully understand.

DEPOSITION
of
Deposition on oath of Eric, Roy, Kurt LA. ; ERT, male of SinbruQivej 65m
BrteshBj, Kttbenhavn, sworn before Ronald Yfelter Rose, Capt. Essex'Regiment
of No.2 ¥ar Grimes Investigation Team, at Copenhagen-on March 12th 1946.
I am 32 years of age, of Danish nationality, bom at Tientsin, North
China. I am at present living at Sinttrumvej 65, Brttnshttj, v/hich is my
permanent home.
I was arrested for illegal activity and handed over to the Gestapo on
the 10th of May 1943, and was in prison for 3 months. I was again arrested
on the 24th of January 1944 and was imprisoned in Denmark until the 15th of
September when I was transferred to the concentration camp NEUENGilviliE. At
about the beginning of October 1944 I 'was transferred to the labour camp at
SCEiWESING near HUSITM, where I remained until approximately the 22nd of
December when I was sent back to NEUMTGAMME because I was sick with pneumonia
and dysentry and I was too weak to work. At this time I weighed only 90
pounds.	J
At first there vrere.about 1500 prisoners at HUSUM and later a further
500. were sent to the camp.	One or two weeks after this 500 of-the prisoners
were sent to another camp at LADBLUND. Most of the prisoners vere Dutch,
there were about 78 Danes, and also some Russians, Poles, French, Belgians,
and also a few Italians, Jugoslavs, and Greeks.
There were about 8 wooden huts in which che prisoners lived. I estimate
that there was sufficient accommodation for 4 to 5CO people under normal
conditions. One hut was used as a kitchen and another for peeling potatoes
and for such things as repairing clothes, shoes etc. It also contained
accommodation for a few block leaders and camp seniors.
Prisoners slept on double-tier wooden beds, two people on each, bed.
They had paper sacks filled with straw to lie on, and only one blanket between
two people. Those who were sick in the revier had only a shirt to sleep m,
and some wore nothing at all.
At the beginning the revier consisted of only one room for the doctors to
, eat and sleep in, and there was one room with-a few beds in it lor patients.
: the revier 'was enlarged to include one complete hut, and eventually o 5
/ ^﻿V

it was not nearly sufficient. There was a ridiculously tiny supply of
taedicines.
Sometimes when patients were declared to he t«o sick to work ar^y more
they were returned to NEUMG&MME.
At first there were only two doctors working in the revierj a doctor
Paul Thygesen, and a doctor Wordentoft who died at the beginning of November
1944 from clysentry. They were both Danes.	Later on there, was also a
French doctor named MARAUD but he was only at HusuGi for a fev? days.	There
were no proper medical orderlies at all, , but a few of us assisted the doctors
in the evenings when we returned from work. I myself have often done this.
Prisoners could only report sick at 5 o'clock in the morning or late
in the evening when they returned from work. If. anyone fell ill or was
injured during the day they were.forced to carry on with their work and they
were often beaten by the Kapos in order to encourage them;
The food was very bad, for breakfast we received one piece of black
bread and a cup of very poor coffee. For lunch we received nothing.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon the prisoners who wefe working were given another
thin piece of.bread, but those who were sick received nothing. In the evening
we were given a terrible kind of soup made from vegetables which normally are
used for cattle food. No special diet was provided f*r the sick prisoners
except for a week kind of milk soup which only a very few people received.
Clothing was very poor, there was not sufficient to keep us warm, and
when it became torn or worn there were no facilities for repair. There was
no way of-washing clothes.
In most cases the clothing did not fit as it was issued without regard
to size. ' i7e had no socks, and our shoes were made	of wood with	cloth-
uppers. The only time	that I received a change of	clothing was	when I	was
discharged from the camp revier at NEIffiNGiMSE.
Although there was plenty of water our doctors said it was unfit for human
use. The latrines were very bad and consisted merely of a hole dug in the
ground with no method of drainage. There were a great number of rats, and
a certain amount of lice existed in the camp.
Prisoners usually had to rise at 5 o'clock in the morning and left the
camp for work between 6 .and 6.30. Sometimes the places of work tvere as
much as 15 miles away.	Often we had to walk great	distances.	We had	to
work continuously until	3 o'clock in the afternoon when we had a	short
pause and were allowed to eaf a thin piece of bread. Then we worked until
dark. Although the weather at that time of the year was very severe no
shelter was provided for the prisoners in which they could rest or take
cover from rain or wind etc. No Sundays or other days-off were allowed.
Most of the work at HUSUM consisted of digging tank traps. It was
supervised by members of the Organization Todt, members of the SS and the Rapes.
Sach working party was guarded by a row of men with rifles who stood about
100 ra. away on either side of us. The 33 guards were provided with leather
whips and the Kapos had a rubber truncheon or stick. With these weapons
the prisoners were constantly being beaten for no reason at all. Every
day several dead bodies were carried back to the camp by the other prisoners.
The Commandant of the camp was Untersturmftihrer Hans GRIEM, his second
in command was Oberscharftlhrer 0ICHLER. The Rapportflihrer was a man named
KLINGER.
The Chief Kapos were:' Willi DEuERT, Willi SCHNEIDER, Franz and -.Ifred
LEVY, man named Martin, and nan named Eugen — I cannot remember their
Surnames.

The chief raethods of punishaent were hy heating with a rubber truncheon
or a stick. Usually the victim received 25 to 50 strokes. Sometimes a
prisoner was drenched with cold water and made to sit on top of a water
hydrant :ft>r several hours until either they fell off or could not stand it
any longer. Then they were placed in the hut where the corpses were stored
before burial, here they were loft all night and had to sleep on the bare
earth as there was no.proper floor or bed of any kind. On an average there
were 10 to 12 bodies in the hut each night. The result was that the victims
often went out of their minds.
another form of punishment was to shut prisoners in the cellar underneath
the kitchen, stark naked. And there was always about a foot of water in the
cellar. The prisoners had to remain there all night.
The Rapportfdhrer KLINGER was the person who normally was responsible for
the above punishments, he was extremely brutal and has beaten a very large
number of prisoners. He always enjoyed kicking pbople.
Oberscharflihrer BIGHLER was not as bad as the others in the camp but he
made little attempt to improve matters.
The Kapos Willi DEMERT, Willi 3CHNEIDER, Franz and Alfred LEW, Martin
and Sugen treated their fellow prisoners very badly indeed and constantly
hit them with sticks and rubber truncheons while they were working.. Sometimes
the prisoners had to work in mud and water up to their waists, but in spite
of this the Kapos would allow them no respite and beat them Whenever they
showed the slightest sign of relaxing.
On one occasion 3 prisoners had been beaten and shut in the hut with
the corpses over-night and the following morning when they went out to work
they were very Y/eak and exhausted and half-crazy. In spite of this they were
made to work in one of the worst possible places, up to their waists in mud
and water. The Kapos Alfred LEVY, Martin and Yfilli DMERT ill-treated these
prisoners so badly by beating and hitting them all the time, that they became
completely mad. They were howling and crying like animals. One of them
attempted to run away, I watched him and I do not think that he knew what he
was doing. One of the Kapos, I think it was Martin called out that the
prisoner was not to be stox^ped. I could see one of the guards following
the prisoner with his rifle and as the latter passed over the line the guard
fired and the prisoner fell dead. This was a deliberate murder because the
Kapos purposely tormented the prisoner until he ran away, knowing full well
that he would be shot, they made no attempt to stop him.
The two most fiendish Kapos were Martin and Eugen, they made the lives
of the other prisoners a constant .misery.
I have made this statement in English, which language I understand
perfectly.

19sworn before Capt. Ronald Halter ROSE, the Essex Recwient, of No 2 .,ar
Criaes Investigation Te'a'n at thuvEBURG, on 6th March 19^*
I sea 55 years of age, of Geraan nationality, born in ilOLZKIRCi-lLE/Bayaria.
My permanent home is at HAMBURG 6, Susannenstr. 19, where I aft- at present
living.
I was arrested for the first time in February 1933 because of high treason.
I was released and arrested again on 11th April 1933- In summer 19U I c^e
to NEUENGAMwE. There I was employed at first in the xitch^. and la e t
bath-house. On 28th September 19^4 I was transferred to HUSlM-LyDEDin©, an
AussenKOmmando. There I was- a icitchen-Kapo. On 3rd January 194^ I was
transferred to DALIM-MEEEEN, also as xitchen-Kapo.
I was one of the first prisoners, who arrived at KUSUM. Here the
prisoners had to build tanic-ditches, artillery - and-machine-gun posi cions.
At the beginning there were at HUSUM about 1000 prisoners, ouc mis numoe
was diminished of about 300 prisoners, who died in 63 days. Ill pnsoi ■
were returned to NKUENGAMME. During this time also some new prisoners
arrived from NEUENGAlHIE.
The commandant in KU3IM was Untersturmfuehrer Hans GHIEM. . The second
in command was Oberscharfuehrer EIGHIEtE Josef KLINGIER was Rappqrtfuhrer.
The main Kspos were Eilly SCHNEIDER, Hilly DHffiRT, Martin TENZ, Franz LEVY
and Alfred LEVY.
The prisoners were billetted in wooden huts. In each nut liven about
• 250 prisoners, who wore separated according to their nationality. There 1;ere
Dutchmen, Belgians, Russians, Frenchmen, Greets, Jugoslaves., Danes, Norwegians,
Germans and Polos. He slept in double-tier wooden beds. At urst there
was no straw, later'we slept on straw mattresses. Each prisoner had two
blantets. Hashing - and toilet facilities were pretty good.
The living-conditions and the food were pretty good, but the wort which
had to be done was extremely heavy and caused many casualties among one
prisoners.
Sometimes
But
In the camp there were no medicaments or bandages at all.
we received medicaments from FIEIEBURG (one time for 28.000 Rk
GRIEM sent the medicaments to ]®UEMGAMME to the SS camp.
The clothing was very bad. It consisted of a pair o£ striped trousers,
a striped jacket, and a striped coat, the only underware we received was a
shirt. '-At first we had wooden shoes but later those were in such a baa
condition that many of the prisoners had to go barefooted. All our clotaes
were always in a very bad condition and it seemed that we always received tno
worse clothing from TTEUENGAMME. In this season the weather ».as very col
and damp and owing to the bad clothing many of the prisoners had to sufxer
severely. Our clothing was-never cleaned.
Owing to the rough weather, the bad clothing and the extremely heagy
worK; we had very many cases of dysentery and pneumonia. mice, bugs and
rats were abundant in the camp. Many prisoners were suitering from crops/
and phlegmonia.﻿-2-
%
The prisoners' doctors were Dr. Paul TIoYGESEi , a Dane, and Dr. iiARAIID,
a Prenctaan, we had also 2 orderlies. as we had no ledicajacnts and as the
hospital was not sufficiently equipped the two doctors could do little to
help the patients. The equipment of the,hospital was bad, there were not
sufficient beds available end host of the patients had to sleep on ^ r®’**
Mostly the hospital was overcrowded. In the hospital there were abou 9 --o
beds, and on the average 200 to 300 prisoners were ill.
The prisoners were very often beaten-and injured but they could_ receive
no medical treatment as no bandages were available. Sometimes bed-linen or
parts of the clothing had to be torn in order to use them as bandages.
The wo rising .parties were supervised by Kapos who all were professional
criminals. Officials of-the organisation Todt and bS-men of the building
brigade (Baubrigade) Berlin, were in charge of the worK. The prisoners
never could worK fast enough for the guards and were beaten to maise tne.i
woric faster.
The prisoners had to get up at. 5.00 a.m. to line up at 6.00 hrs and
o-o to worK at 7.00 hrs.	They had to walK approximately 3 hours until Ib.uo
a.m. They worKed up to 13.00 or 14.00 hrs as they had to be m the camp
when it began to grow darK.
Nearly every evening when the worKing parties returned the prisoners
had 3 to 4 deaths. Sometimes when the political prisoners had told the _
Kapos not to beat the prisoners GRIEM ordered that the Kapos should use obicKer
sticics, he himself used a. truncheon which was 1 metre long and 2 cm cuicK.
In the camp was no official Kind of punishment, but when a prisoner
tried to escape he usually received about 100 lashes by Untersturmfuhrer
GPJEM. When GRIEM punished at other times he usually gave 30 lashes.
KUNGIER or another Kapo punished the prisoners the number of the lashes
for the greater part depended on the mood of tne Kapos.
A further method of punishment, which sometimes was executed by G-ISEM,
Rapportfuehrer KLINGIER, and Oberscharfuehrer .dEIB'EERT, was to maice the
prisoners go over a very small planK which was laid over a broad water dice 1.
Prisoners, who reported ill, had to do this so that one coul se® “‘
they had said the truth. When the prisoners were on the planK GRIEI.1 or
one of the others pushed the planK unto the water. • They did this because
it amused them to see how the prisoners fell into the water.
One of KLINGLER'8 favourite pastimes was if prisoners had been reported
to him that they had stolen food or potatoes, to dip them into water and.
then makce them sit on the hydrant with a turnip or a potato m the ’aouttu
This happened in November or December 1944 when it was very	f*10
prisoners had to sit there until they fell down, that meant that the
prisoners sometimes set there for 4 or 3 uours.
Jit least one occasion three prisoners, who tried to escape, were
improsioned in a hut in which the corpdes were stored. As the door °°^a
not be locKed they were guarded by '.ill DEIlffiR 2nd Alfred and Pranz 1EVY.
The next morning they were sent to worK with a special party, tie so-ca e
punistoent party under Willy EffiHMER. They were so badly treated by DuxMh.-,
and the other Kapos that one'of them tried to escape and was shot by ttie
guards. The other two died a short time later;
The food at EUSIM was rather good. At DJbUM it was not so good, as. it
was supplied by the N3V.; in this district there Were a great number oi
PoW. Camps which tooK precedence over the concentration camps.

I an Johannes MEYER, born on 9th March 1896 at ALBERSDOEF Kreis
Suederdithnarschen* Pastor of the Evgl, Lutla. Parish Church L/YDEIUND * of Gerr-ian
nationality,
I have been in office at Lu'DELULLD since the beginning of 1938* before that
tine I was in Kreis HJSUI-I,
At the beginning of November 1 944 an Aussenlcoixiando of the concentration
camp NEUENCAMME was transferred to this place. The inmates were accommodated
in the labour camp of the Reichsorbeitsdienst (National Labour Service). The
camp remained in our village until the 15th December 1944. A part of the
inmates were transferred to Schwesing near Husun* another part returned to
NEOENGAIt'ffl.
2000 prisoners were transferred to this place and had to live in the camp
of the Reichsarbeitsdienst where in peace tine 200 workers had been accommodated*-
Their work consisted of building a tank ditch from BRAMSTEDTLUHD to HJMPTHJP.
This tank ditch had to be completed with haste as our supreme command expected
an invasion of British troops from the air and sea.
In my capacity as chairman of the Church Council I was in charge of the
administration of the Cemetery, Here I had the opportunity to speak to the
prisoners daily, and thus I could form an opinion about the treatment in the
comp. The accommodation in the camp was unworthy of human beings.	At the
beginning the prisoners did not even have straw, they had to lie on the bare
floor.in spite of the beginning of winter. But not all could lie down as
they were so tightly packed together that the majority had to spend the night
in a crouching position,
I have repeatedly seen the Kapos beating the prisoners at the working
place. North of the village of LADELUND I saw a Kapo striking a prisoner
in the face with the heel of his boot.
The screaming of the prisoners could be heard in the village daily. On
the way to and from the working place the Rapes also beat the prisoners at will.
I have seen this repeatedly. A protest of mine was without success.
X have seen that of the $00 dead, whom I buried in the Cemetery, about
150 were entirely naked and I ascertained definitely that nobody was without
marks resulting from beatings. Some had been beaten to such an extent that
I as a lay-man say they were beaten to death. 2 or 3 dead had been shot in
the back of the neck. In most cases the Camp Authorities gave dysentery/as
the cause of death. But according to the appearance of the corpses in many
cases there had been another cause of deatn,

.. I am Werner STROHKIRCHEN, horn on 23rd June 1914> Occupations coachman,
..of German nationality, my permanent home is at H/\MBURG-EIMSBUETTEL,
Schenefelderstr. 23*
I was arrested on 2nd January 1937 because of high treason and sent for
5 years to the penitentiary at FUHLSBUETTEL. On 2nd February 1942 I was
transferred to NEUENGAMME concentration campo
In August 1944 I was sent to the Aussenkommando of NEUENGAMME at YffiDEL
and on the 15th November of the same year I was sent to the Aussenkommando
VERSEN near Meppen.
When I at first arrived at VERSEN the SS-personnel were:
Obersturmfuhrer TUEMMEL
- Rottenfuhrer HEIDE
Unterscharfuhrer SMOIENSKI
.Rottenfuhrer BEHR
Oberscharfuhrer JAKOBS
Camp Commandant
Rapportfuhrer
Biockleader
In charge of the kitchen
Proviantmeister.
At the beginning of January'1945 we received a new camp commandant,
whose name was Oberscharfuhrer GUENTHER. The other SS-people did not change.
Prom January 1945, during the time that GUENTHER was camp commandant,
the Stutzpunktleiter of EMSLAND was Obersturmfuhrer GRIEM. This man was in
charge of all the small camps in this area, whicn were all Aussenkommanaos
od NEUENGAMME.
At first there were about 1000 prisoners in the camp but tnis number
increased until we were 3000, this was the official capacity of the camp.
These prisoners were mostly Dutch, Danes, Belgians, French and about 20
Germans.
There were 6 wooden barracks of the same size as at NEUENGAMME. In ny
opinion about 100 people could have been accommodated there, but actually,
500 men lived in each. The prisoners slept on the floor which was covered
with straw. There was only one blanket between eaoh two men.
Y/e wore civilian clothes marked with yellow crosses. This clothing .ra.s
provided from AUSCHWITZ and BIRKENAU oonoentration camps.and had belonged to
people who had been gassed. There was not always sufficient clothing and
often the prisoners had to take the clothes of the dead in order to clothe
themselves suitably. At first the prisoners went barefooted and later we
received wooden clogs with uppers made of oanvas.
There was a washroom which was large enough for 20 prisoners to 'wash
themselves at the same time, but we had no soap and no towels. Most of
the prisoners were in such a state that they had not the will-power to keep
themselves clean even if there had been better washing facilities.
Owing to the dirtiness and the difficulty to keep clean, lice abounded
in the camp. Typhus was also vaiy common, but the SS doctors tried to
/ conceal﻿-■ 2 -
4
conaee.l this fact and called it dysentery. There were many fleas etc., in
the canp caused, by the dirtinessand the unhygienic conditions.
The hospital consisted of two barracks with 500 patients in each. There
Yi/ere alj/ays about 1000 of 3000 prisoners in the hospital. They lived under
the sane conditions as the other prisonerSj they had to sleep on the floor
idiich was covered with straw. The main diseases were: typhus) phlegjnonia*
dfopsy and underfeeding. There were also a great number of open wounds.
There were three prisoners doctores but they had practically no equipment
and medicaments to do their work. Bandages usually consisted of margarine
or other paper. Sometimes the doctors received assistance from the P0Y,r
camp hearty. SS-rRottenfuehrer HEGER visited the com:- some times in order to
inspect the hospital, but he was no qualified doctor and did not improve the
conditions at all. The material which HEGER ordered for the hospital has
never been supplied and eventually he ceased to visit the camp.
During the tine from November 1944 to March 1945 there -were at least 800
dead. These people vrere buried on a special cemetery which was about 200
metres away from the camp.
Many dead were the direct result of beatings which the prisoners
received while at 'work or in the camp, ibout 10 people were shot during
the time I was in the camp.either by SIIOLENSKI himself or one of the guards
on his command.
The prisoners had to do digging work and to built fortifications.
Sometimes if a prisoner escaped or was missing the guards arrested, any
Dutchmen 'who happened to be nearby and took him into the camp in order to
bring back the right number of prisoners. I know at least 26 cases in
which this happened.
The food of the prisoners was totally inadequate. For breakfast we
received a slice of bread and a very poor coffee and one a 'week we received
soup. In the evening we received, one or one and a quarter litres of soup
and three slices of bread. I know that Rottenfuehrer HEGER complained about
the small quantity of food and said that he could not be.held responsible
for the condition of the prisoners as they received so little. But neverthe-
less the rations were never increased.
The punishments in'the camp were extremely severe. If a prisoner
broke into the canteen or any other locked room he was hanged. These hangings
were executed at NEHENGAMME. For taking bread or vegetables from the
kitchen the prisoner received a beating with the oat o' ninetails and was
transferred to the punishment company. If a prisoner tried to out off a
part of his balnket to wrap it round his feet he received about 50 lashes
and we ’were told that he was reported to BERLIN. I myself received, 50 lashes
and was relieved of ny post as camp senior because I was friendly with the
Frenchmen. I received, this beating by Obersturmfuehrer THUMANN at
NEDENGAMME.
SMOLENSKI and BEHR ’were the worst SS-people in the camp. BEHR beat
a lot of people in the camp kitchen.and SMOLENSKI did the most of his beatings
when he ’was outside the camp with the working parties. Rottenfuehrer HEIDE
has also beaten many people, but he was not so severe.
Y/hen GUENTHER bedame comp commandant and Hans GRIEM was
Stuetzpunktleiter the conditions was almost the same. GUENTHER, however,
improved the living conditions a little, he supplied more straw for the
prisoners to sleep on and' each man received one blanket.
At'VERSEN I was camp senior and therefore I was in a good position to
'watch all what happened in the camp. When GRXEM visited the camp he only
made a short inspection and then went av/ay again. He never ordered any
/ improvements﻿Jfc	- 3 -

at Bad CEXNH&.USEN on May 24, 194-6.	'
I am an investigating officer, employed by the War Crimes Investigation
Unit, Headquarters British Army of the Rhine.
During the course of my investigations .into the conditions which existed
at HUSUM, LADELUND, DALtM and VERSEN concentration camps, all of which were
Aussenkoirmandos of NEUENGAfttiE, I carried out an inspection of each of the
said camps.
H U S U M.
This camp is at present occupied by a German labour company and has been
considerably altered by the said unit' so -that It is1 no longer in exactly the
same condition as at the time of its occupation by concentration camp prisoners.
I was informed by the British officer, who, now commands HUSUM oanp, that
a few of the huts, however, had not been altered.	These he indicated to me
and I thereupon made a plan which I now produce and is marked plan "A".
I refer to the said plan "A". The huts which are marked No.3 to 11 are
the huts which were’Occupied by the concentration camp prisoners.;The measure-
ments as shown on this plan were obtained by me during my inspection. The huts
numbered 2 and 12 have been completely altered and therefore I took no
measurements. The huts numbered 10 and 11 have been dismantled.
All buildings in this oamp are of normal wooden construction similar to
those at the main camp of NEUENGAMME.
I also obtained a photograph of a water hydrant which stands by the side
of the camp path. This is the hydrant which is referred to in the Deposition
of Dr. Paul THTGESEN (Production No. 171) and Eric LAMMERT (Production No.172)
and Michael MEULIER (Production No, 173), The Photograph which I now produce
and is marked "G" and signed by me is the Photograph to which I refer.
LADELUND
I carried out an inspection of the LADELUND camp in company with Pastow
Johannes MEIER, the Parish Priest of the village of LADELUND, who informed me
that he had visited the oamp during its occupation by concentration caxip
prisoners, and on my instruction he indicated to me the various details of
the camp which are marked on the plan which I now produce and is marked Plan
"B". The measurements shown on this plan are only approximate.
The huts in this camp are of thin wooden construction and axe unlined.
At the time of iiy inspection this camp was occupied by 175 refugees and
in my opinion was overcrowded.
DALUM and VERSEN
These two camps have been altered to such an extent that it was of no
particular value to make a detailed plan. The plans which I now produce﻿4

In the cas6 of plan "D" I have indicated in red ink those huts which
were occupied by concentration camp prisoners. The information for this was

investigations.	;	*

On 1st June 1943 I was promoted Wntersturmfuehrer and became platoon-
commander of the 2nd platoon of the 2nd company of the SS-guardr»battalion.
At the end of August 1943 I was sent to the Aussenkoranando HANNOVER-
STOECKEN as^ camp-coranandant. I stayed there about 3 months and then returned
to NEUENGMiVIEwhere I stayed about 14 .days and then was sent to HANNOVER-

The first 3 or 4 weeks at HUSUM I was camp commandant. Then an
Obqrscharfuehrer EICHLER came into the camp as camp commandant and I took

At the beginning of January 194-5 I was sent to DALUM near MEEPEN by
Obersturnbannfuehrer PAULI, the commandant of NEIENGAMME. The first 8 days
at DALUt/l I was camp commandant. Then Oberscharfuehrer SEIEEERT took over
the duties as camp comandant and I became liaison officer for the
Aussenkoramandos at DjiLW/I and VSRSEN.
The camp coia.iandant at VERSEN was Oberscharfuehrer GUENTHER,
/At﻿At-the beginning of April 194-5 the inmtes of the carps at DALUM and
VERSEN tiere returned to NEHEN3-j'iI'i;iE craing to the advance of the enemy. Two
officers cajae from HEUEMJji'ME to supervize the irovc. They were Obersturmfuehrer
von STOER, who was an anti-aircraft officer, and Dr. Bruno KETT, there was also
another Obersturnfuehrer but I do not remember his name.
I then stayed at NEUENG-Atfffl until the' end of April 194-5 us officer in charge
of armoury. Then I was sent to SOEREN near Bad BEG-ENBERG where some weapons
were stored, some in a dairy and some in the open. I remained at SOEREN a
short time and made,several trips back to NElffiN&AMMB to fetch more weapons.
These weapons were brought to RENDSBURG and destroyed in a wood near a search-
light, battery.	: . :j
At the end of the war 1 returned to HAMBURG to be discharged. I lived
at HAMBURG. with a cousin, as it was not possible for me to return to BERLIN.
X was arrested on 26th August 194-5.
I admit that the accommodations at 'MDELUND were very overcrowded and
that there was a great number of dead. Most of these dead, were caused by
pneumonia and dysentery. I only know' that one person wa.s shot, this happened
while the.prisoner tried to escape. At BUSUM the conditions were also bad
but I do not know of any case when prisoners were tortured or punished very
severely.
In my opinion the conditions were pretty good in the other camps I was in
charge of. I never received any complaints about the conditions inside the
oamp.
I knpw that the Kapos punished the prisoners with sticks and rubber
truncheons. But they received the authority to do so from Otersturmfuehrer
THUMANN of NEUENGAMME and not from me.	. •
I. also admit that I myself occasionally punished'prisoners .slightly
beating their head. But I never treated them very severely.
On. several occasions I attempted to improve the conditions in the carp,
for instance I was able to arrange that the camp at LADELUND was closed earlier
than intended.

Roumania. Occupation: Fariiier.- Naturalised German (Rour.aanian). My
pen;ianent. address is GROSSJETSHE, Lenaustr.332.
In Noveiaber I joined ,the SS in the Totehkppf Battalion Oranienburg.
I uas then trained for two months, in ORANTENBUEG -as a recruit, I was
transferred to the DACH/JJ concentration camp on 16th January 1942. On 1st
January 1943 I was promoted to' the rank of Sturnam.
On the 18th March 194-3 I was transferred to the JMUENGAMME Aussenkommando
at DRWETTE, near BRUNSVIEOK. I remined there till 2bth April 1914 when I
was sent to the Main camp at NEUENGiM/IE.
On the 9th October 1 944- I Was transferred to the Aussenkomuando in HUSUM
as a blockf uehrer.	lawas. promoted to Rottenfuehrer on the 9th November, The
HUSUM camp was closed on the .27th December 1944) and I returned to NEUEN&JMffi.
On 3rd January 1945 I was sent to the DALIM Aussenkomiando, where I was also
employed as a Blockf uehrer.
I went back to NEUENGfUiE on about the 26th March 1945, and was then
enlisted in the NEBER fighting group to prepare for the front. On the 1st
May we began to march from HAMBURG to LIMBECK. ¥e were taken prisoner near
Bad SEGEHERG and were then treated as prisoners of war.
The Commandant in HUSUM and DALUM was Untersturmfuehrer Hans GRIEM.
My duties as Blockfuehrer were to supervise the cleanliness, discipline
and the general order in the camp, I had to supervise the detailing of the
various working parties, and to count then in the mornings and evenings when
they were going to and from the work, and to call the roll.
The order to punish the prisoners usually cane from Unterstumfuehrer Hans
GREEK, also from Oberscharfuehrer EICHIER, in HUSUM, and Oberscharfuehrer
SEIFERT in DALIM. I used only a stick with ‘which to punish the prisoners.
I never carried out the punishments by myself, always when Oberscharfuehrer
EICHLSR or Oberscharfuehrer SEIFERT were present. I admit that I have beaten
prisoners with a stick, but only when I received orders to do so. I further
admit that I have driven prisoners away with a stick, when they were standing
outside the Revicr in the morning, but only because the doctor told me that
these prisoners were definitely not sick, or that they were fit for work.
Sometimes prisoners wore made to walk across a small plank that was
laid over a water ditch in the DALIM camp. Once one of these prisoners fell
into the water but he was not pushed. I personally had nothing to do with
this, but the order was given to me to arrange for a Kapo to lay a plank
across the water and I then stood near by and looked on.
Sometimes prisoners were made to sit on a Hydrant as a punishment, but
they were not soaked with water, but when I ordered this, I did it only on
orders from superior officers.
/I know﻿~2~
t
I know that once a prisoner was shut up in the hut with the corpses,
by order of EXCHIER, but I do not know how long he had to renain there,
*
I can renenber that on one occasion a Russian was sho-fc while he was
working with a Coroaando, and he was brought back into the canp an a cart
which was drawn by 8 Russians. Although this was the only tine, that a ’
prisoner was shot, and where I saw the body, X can no longer renumber the
details of this event. As far as I know this Russian was shot during the
proceeding night by a Marine Guard whilst trying to escape. The body
ijas examined by a French doctor, while it still lay on the cart*	As far
as 1 know he was dead.
Untersturnfuehrer GRIEM gave me the order to see that the body was
displayed at the canp gate and that all prisoners returning fron wrork were to
be made to march past the body. in the event of a prisoner failing to look
he was to receive 25 strokes with a stick. Each tine a■Oonaando came into
the oanp, I told the respective interpreters to translate the above order.
The dead body was s tripped to the waist every time a Oonmaado came in and
then dressed again.
During the above incident.I never beat the dead Russian (or any other
prisoner).

Ocoupation: Commerioal employee, of German nationally. Wiy permanent home
is at BERLIN N. 0. 55, Xperstr. 23*
I joined the NSDAP+ in July 1929, and on the 1st August I hecame a
member of the SA.
In September 1932 I was voluntarily transferred into the SS* On 15th
November, 1939 I was oalled up to the Waffen-SS as.a gunner.
I was sent to MEUENGAMME oonoentration camp as a pay-olerk of the 1st
company of the guard battalion, and stayed in NEUENGAMME from the 18th April,
1940 to March 1944* In May 1942 I was promoted to Oberscharfuehrer. During
this time I held various positions dealing with the financial affairs of the
camp.
I March 1944 I was posted to the Aussenkommando at FORTA as a clerk and.
in July I was transferred to LANGEREICE in Westphalia, where I was at first
the deputy Kommandofuehrer, and later on became, the Kommandofuehrer. The
Commandant of 'these two Aussenkommandos was Obersturmfuehrer WICKLEIN. In
September 1944 T went to'BREMEN, Borgwerd.twerke, and in October to
’WILHELMSHAiXEN. Moreoever I was Kommandofuehrer in these two oamps.
From December 1944 till 24th March 1945 I was Kommandofuehrer in tne
Aussenkommando in VERSEN. In this camp I had the following staff:

( BLockfuehrer)

(Blockfuehrer on the working site)
Hauptsturmfuehrer Dr. LAUB was also in the camp during December,
January, and February 1945*
My commanding, officer was Untersturmfuehrer Hans GRIEM, who had his
headquarters in DALUM.
The number of prisoners in VERSEN var led from 1900 to I4OO, most of them
were Dutchmen, Russians, Poles, Frenchmen, and Danes and a few Czechs.
They had to do earth work that is to say they built fortifications. The
authorities whowere responsible for the supervision of the ./ork were SS
Baustab (building staff) in MEEPEN, commanded by Obersturmfuenrer SOHiiEFER.
The instructions as to how the prisoners were to be treated were laid
down in writing by the authorities in NEUENGAMME, and I received them from
there.
My duties consisted in looking after the order in the camp and also for
the general administration, but I had nothing to do with the supervision
of the ’work.
/ Only﻿t
Only 6 or 7 of. the huts in ViHSEN v/ere used as conoentration camp huts,
hut the rest of the camR was used as a prisoner of war pamp, I was responsible
for the food and accommodation of the prisoners hut the food was supplied by
the NSV and was cooked, for the camp inmates and the prisoners of war in one
kitchen (the food for the prisoners of war was supplied by the iTehrmacht)
The great number of dead. 'Was caused because many were already sick when
sent from NEUENGAIffiffi, for example once when 500 arrived out of which 300 were
sick, and another time when 50 out of a total of 80 people were sick when
they arrived. We had sufficient medical supplies and the'food for the sick
was very good.
Before I came to VE^SEN Hauptsutrmfuehrer TUEI.MEL was the commandant of
the camp and I know that two Dutchmen were arfested unofficially, and brought
into the canp. When I arrived I sent these two people to the' Gestapo in
MEEPEN. I have heard thatihey were reie'ased. arid, have also submitted a report
about this to NEUENGAMME.
I know of no incidents where prisoners were shot whilst I whs in the
camp. I have o.lso never heard that anybody was beaten in the camp in FEE SEN.
When a prisoner tried to escape he; ’Was sent to NEUENGAMME but I do- not know
what happened to him then.

Captain Ronald "alter ROSE, Essex Rejiuent, of T.ror Crimes Investigation Unit,

I am hllheln Johann Heinrich JACOBS born on 10th December 1889, at
VISoELl-ilEVE Kreis Rotenburg. Occupation: Agricultural Adviser, of German
nationality. ' My permanent home is at HAMBURG 36, Grosse Theaterstr. 49 K.
I joined the NSDAP in July 19331. I joined the 3S in 1934 in order to
get a job, and on the 1st October 1939 I was called up for the Aaffen-SS.
I held the ranic of Rottenfuehrer.
I was employed in the following camps: ORANIEIBURG, (4weeics), NEUEB&iMHE,
S'HERTOGENBOSCIi, VOTED, and VERSEN. The two last camps were Aussenxommandos
of NEUENGAMi.iE.
At the end of 1942 I was promoted Oberscharfuehrer. At VEDEL and VERSED
I was Proviantmeister, (in charge of the food). I was responsible for the
clothing and the food of the prisoners.
While I was at VERSEN a Hauptsturmfuehrer TUEMMEL was the Commandant,
I heard that two Dutchmen had been arrested unofficially and had been brought
into the camp as prisoners. I believe that they were brought into the camp
to replace 2 prisoners who ran away. I do not icnow whether this is true or not.
During the course of ay duties I was very much outside the camp and
therefore I have never heard or seen that the prisoners in the camp were
illtreated.
In my opinion a great part, of the deaths a.t VERSEN were caused by the
fact that many prisoners were already ill when they were sent from
NEUENGAivME. The reason was not that there was a lacic of food or bad food.
At the beginning there was not sufficient equipment to treat the sicK, and
this was also the reason for the great number of deaths.

painter, of German nationality. My permanent home is at ffiA/IBURG-POFPENBUETTEL,
Glashutterstr. 43
In 19a0 I v/as arrested because of looting, I spent then 8 months in
prison and at the end of 19a0 I was transferred to the concentration camp
HEUElTGiiM'ffl, I stayed at MEUENGAMME until Septeriber 1944. I ms an ordinary
prisoner and worked in the potato cellar.
3h September 1944- I was transferred to HUSUM and LMDELUKD Aussenkommando,
’>/hon we arrived at HUSUM I became a Kapo together with some other German
prisoners,
At the end of December 1944 the camps HUSUM and LMDELUND closed down and
the prisoners were returned to the main camp at HEUENGAMME. We stayed there
a few days and then were transferred to another mussenkonmando at DALUM. At	—J
DALUl/i I was also a Kapo.
'The commandant of the above camps was Untersturmfuhrer GRIEM. Some time
after the camp HUSUM had been opened GRIEM became an Obersturmfuhrer.
My duties as a Kapo were, to supervise the working parties on the my
from and to the working place and' on the actual working site. GRIEM himself
wanted to have very littl.a to do with the leading of the camp consequently
the responsibility mainly fell on the Kapos.
If the prisoners did not work properly or committed other offences ye
were supposed to report them to the camp commandant. But on some occasions we
took the punishment into our own hands, more or less the Kapos had the
liberty to do as they pleased. They could either report the prisoners to the
camp commandant and punish then themselves, or they could only report them,
or they could punish them themselves and not report them. GRIEM himself
preferred that the Kapos ran about all the time with sticks,
I could never forget, that I myself was a prisoner and therefore could not
bring myself to punish the others. I have never reported or punished any of
the prisoners.
Some of the other Kapos, however, treated the prisoners badly. Several
times I have' seen that Uilli DEHMER and Martin TENZ punished some of the
prisoners. I suppose that EGHMER was.mentally deficient, and he was disliked
by the prisoners to such an extent, that he was attacked and beaten up by
them as soon as he cane back to NEUEWGAMIviE. Several- times I have been told
by the prisoners that they had been beaten up by the other Kapos, but I have
never seen it myself.

Civilian Interment Cnap at NEIHUEI®TER, sworn before Capt. Ronald Walter
SOSE, Essex Rerpiuent, at HdUIIENSTER on 6th April, 1946.
I an 12 years of age, of Goman nationality, born at PANSDORP, near BGEBECK.
My pemanent hone is at HAKBDEG, Hoohstr. 7.
In the beginning of 1937 I was arrested because of resistance against the
Gestapo. I was sent to the concentration ennp at FUMSBNETTEL and was re-
leased at the end of the year. In January or February 1938 I was arrested
again because of a criminal offence and was sentenced to 5 years penal
servitude at BREMEN, After I had served oy sentence I was sent to the
concentration canp MIUENGAMME on orders of the Gestapo.
In October 19441 was transferred to the Aussen-konsjando HQSIM-LADELUND. In
this carjp I becaae a Ka.po, and as such it was ny duty to supervise the
various parties of prisoners when they were digging tank-ditches.
It was ay duty to see to it that the prisoners worked properly and that they
did the required anount of work. Besides this I was responsible for the
discipline of the prisoners.
I was supposed to report all prisoners, to the canp corxiandant, who did not
work properly or who conmitted other snail crimes. But as I knew what this
would have meant for the prisoners, I carried out the punishment's myself, to
save then fron the more severe punishment by the canp commandant. The
name of the canp commandant was Hans GRIEM.
I admit that I hit people with the fist in their faces but in these cases
they were Russian prisoners which I had tp punish. They attempted to rob
prisoners of other nationa.lities in the camp. The Danes, Belgians and
Frenchmen etc, used to receive Red-Cross parcels, but the Russians received
none, and for this reason they tried to take the contents of these parcels
away from their fellow prisoners by force.
There were considerably more Russians in the camp than prisoners of other
nationalities, and they often used their knives to threaten the other
prisoners. That was why it was necessary for me and the other Ivapos to use
sticks and empty rubber hoses to protect ourselves.
Towards the end of the war I was sent to DAI/JM, where we had the same
commandant, namely GRIM/I. During my stay in DALUM two Russians were shot as
they attempted to escape. On orders of the commandant the bodies were laid
on the ground near the gate. When the prisoners came back from work they
had to file past the corpses. Willy SCHNEIDER and myself had orders to
stand beside the corpses and to ensure that all orisoners looked at then.
To make life easier for the prisoners I endeavoured to put the SS and Marines
at loggerheads with each other by going‘to GRHIM and telling him that the
sentries were maltreating the prisoners and thus left the chain of sentries.

Deposition on oath of Willi DEMMBRj male, at present interned at

ROSS, at NEUHQSt'TSTER on 1st Itay
I am Willi DEMMER, born on 22nd October '1904, Occupation: miner, of
'German nationality, my permanent home is at BUAR near OJLSENKIRCHEN, Sedansuro
In 1940 I was arrested because of sabotage and at first I was sent to
a lunatic asylum for examinationo I stayed there 2 years and was then
transferred to N3UMGAMME concentration camp. In September 1944 I was sent
to the Aussenkommando at HUSUM. Here I became a foreman.
My duties were to supervise the work of the prisoners. We received no
other instructions than to see to it that the prisoners worked properly.
If the prisoners did not work properly we were suppiosed to report them
to Obersturmfuhrer GRIM, the camp commandant. A short time later on GRIEL
ordered that we should take a stick and beat the prisoners if they did not
work properly.
I have never reported any prisoner but several times I beat them in oraer
to restore order. On one occasion when a Russian stole food from another
prisoner's coat pocket while at work, a French prisoner complained to me
and I had to punish the Russian in order to satisfy the other prisoners.
Each time Red Cross parcels arrived at the camp the Russians tried to steal
them from the other prisoners by force. They made long knives, and if^the
Kapos tried to restore order they had to use sticks in ordei to
themselves. On one occasion one man was cut dead and they bit off he
finger of another man.
The Russians often caused trouble if the meals were distributed at the
working place. They Inried to prevent that the other prisoners got their
share and therefore I found it sometimes necessary to use force to restor-
order.
I remember no incident that prisoners were shot when trying to escape
at HUSUM.
After the camp at HUSUM closed down, I was returned to NEUENGAMMS
together with the rest of the prisoners. Some ds^s later 1 ^	cr	GBjma
Aussenkoirmando at DAIUM.. Here we had the same Kommandant, Obersturmf^hrer .
At DALUM the Russian prisoners continued to be the constant cause of
trouble, and it was very often necessary to punish them as they broke in^
the blocks of the other prisoners and stole etc. They stole 00 y
the other prisoners but also among themselves.
Each nationality was kept separate in- fche camp.
At the beginning of April the prisoners were returned from DALUM to

Deposition on oath of Otto Heinrich Paul THUStMEL, raalc, of HOLLINGSTEDT,
Kreis SCHLESWIG, at present No.1 C.I.C. sworn before ae, Staff Sergeant
Pranlc Peter CODING, 8th Kings Royal Irish Hussars of War Critics Investigation
Unit at FEUMUENSTER on 1st of June 192*j5.
I an Otto Heinrich Paul IHID.LEL, occupation: Parner bom on 10th October
189$ at BRi'iUNSHvvLIG, of Goman nationality.
During the first World War I was an officer of the artillery. On 26th
August 1939 I was called up again and served ns a Hauptmann of the
artillery. In June 1944 I was detailed to ORANIEHBURG to the .oain-
adninistration of the S3-CONCENTRATION coup. I could select a unit and
selected NEUMGAMME as this is in the vicinity of ay home. At NBH3NGAMME
I belonged to the guard battalion. Wit.first it was only ny duty to study
the canp. I was not authorised to give orders. On 3rd September 1944-
I became damp comandant of the Camp, which should be opened at WILHEL1SHAVEN-
BiiNDEi-WEG. 'The conditions for the prisoners at this camp were better than
at NEUENGiLME, except the first days. At the beginning of November 1944
I was relieved and returned to NEUENGAMaE where some days later I was
entrusted with a transport of 1000 prisoners with whom I founded the Camp
VERSEN neo.r MEFPEN. Some days later a further 2000 prisoners arrived.
These prisoners were of different nationalities mainly French, Dutch and
Danes.
The living conditions for the. prisoners were bad. The prisoners were
accomodated in wooden huts, 500 men. in each hut. There were no beds in
the huts and therefore the prisoners had to lie on straw on the ground.
They lay in rows closely packed together. The fact, that most the
■prisoners were suffering from dysentery made the limited accommodation
still worse. About ~lty of the prisoners were already ill when they were
transferred from FEUMGrAffiE.
The prisoners had to make the journey, which lasted 24 hours, in passenger
trains without window penes. On the journey -and on the ’way from MSPEEN
to VERSEN some prisoners fainted and later died from the consequences.
In each wooden hut there were two stoves, but they were insufficient
to heat the huts sufficiently. There was sufficient peat to heat these
stoves.
The latrines were roofed ditches with wooden seats. In ray opinion they
were sufficient for healthy but not for ill people; it was especially
bad for the latter to use these latrines in wind and weather and it is
probable that kidney trouble and pneumonia resulted therefrom.
On the 4th or 5th day of my stay there I refused to be responsible for the
further management of the canp. I wrote a letter to this effect to
Obersturnbannfuehrer PAULY. Ivrote that the condition of health of the
prisoners was really bad, that it grew worse from day to day, that we
received no medicaments and bandages for the canp as well as no clothing.
I received the most necessary medicaments from the ST^L/iG 6(?).
As a consequence of my letter Obersturmbannftuehrer PAULY arrived together
with Haupt3tunfuohrer TRBCZINSKI, the Canp Doctor from iiEULFG/dLl , for a
revision. PAULY was shocked and wide TRBCZIiBKI fully responsible for the
conditions. Then the most necessary material was supplied and the
bad conditions were altered.
During/..,﻿*
During the tiae I was Caap Co-nandant abort 160 or 180 prisoners died.
Most of then died of dysentery and dropsy. 'Two or three were shot when they
tried to escape.
i'.t DiiLUK was a groat STAL/iG, where Dutch,on (several thousand) were interned.
It so '.etii-.os happened' that in the evening y guards issed one of the
prisoners entrusted to the.:, and that they brought back, a Dutchman fro a
DiiLUM instead. They si..ply picked up one of the Dutchmen walking about
and suspected nothing.
As Caap Couuandant of .the Car.ip YMR3EW I did all ’./ha.t was possible to. improve
the conditions' in the coup.
In the middle of. December I returned to NEUSNGAAliA, and shortly afterwards
I went to l.RIMCTE near BIAiUKSCB/EIG, there I stayed until the end of
■ January 1945 without holding a position.	,
I, returned, .to-BjUEKGwAj.id again and from the beginning of March until the

s\7orn before Captain H.L. 6/iKDaElii^ of No, 2 Jar Crimes Investigation Team
at' HAMBURG on 13th December, 194-5.
I an Josef K&UBSi&NNj of Sussannenstr 19, HAMBURG, aged 4-1, of Gorman
nationality.
On the 6th March 1933 I was arrested by the Germans because I ms a
member of the Comunist Party. I ms sentenced to six years imprisonment
for high treason and after that v«as sent to the concentration camp at
SACHSEItEfe.USEN, then to HERTZOGENBOSCH, back to SACHSDi'JLiUSaN and from there
to the concentration camp at NEUENGAiviE in October 1944-, The concentration
camp was under the command of Obersturmbannfuehrer PAULI.
In January 194-5 I was sent to the labour camp at DALUM which was a
branch camp of iEUENGAM-E, I there held the position of Lageraelteste. In
February 194-5 a Russian called GRILENKO escaped while out at work. When
caught he had been shot by a marine whose name I do not know. After the
shooting the KorXiando leader telephoned Untersturmfuehrer GRIEM and told him
that the Russian had been caught and shot. The tine of the telephone call was
about 14-30 hours on a Wednesday towards the end of February, Rottenfuehrer
KLINGER was then Instructed by Untersturmfuehrer GRIEM to bring the Russian
back to the camp. He did this and returned to the. camp about half past three.
The Russian GRILENKO was brought back into- the camp on a cart drawn by four
Russians. KLINGER then reported to GRIEM in the latter's office. The-Russian
was lying on the cart in front of the-office. I was standing inside the camp
at a distance of about 18 metres from the cart. MUELLER, who worked in the
kitchen, was standing about 10 metres away from me. At this time I did not
recognise the Russian. Untersturmfuehrer GRIEM came out of his office With
KLINGER and went up to the Russian, He asked him, "Why did you run away, you
swine?" The Russian did not answer. The Russian's body was moving. KLINGER
then seized him by the legs and dragged him from the cart. The cart wall 1 m 20
to 1 m 30 in height. The Russian fell on the ground on his head and shoulders,
GRIEM stood aside with his hands in his pockets, laughing. The four Russians
were also present. GRIEM then kicked the Russian in the face, chest and stomach.
This-lasted for about five or six minutesj during this time KLINGER also struck
him in the face with his stick. The Russian lay on- the ground moaning.
KLINGER ordered the four Russians to take the cart into the camp. After this
maltreatment, GRIEM went about 10 metres away from the Russian and called to me:
’'Lageraelteste, take this swine away", GRIEM re-entered his house and KLINGER
remained. The four Russians who had taken the cart away were now standing
GRILENKO and laid him on the ground by the gate. KLINGER and I went with him.
MUELLER, who had been standing near me all the time but who did not accompany
me out of the camp, now called out to me, "Is he dead?" I answered; "Rather",
MUELLER then went back to the kitchen.
I then fetched the camp doctor, a Frenchman called MARAUD ( I do not know
whether this is correctly spelt). While I was returning with the doctor I saw
KLINGER tearing open the Russian's clothing and this revealed two bullet wounds
on the right side of his chest. The doctor felt his pulse and told KLINGER
that he was dead. Then I returned to the hospital with the doctor and he told
me that if GRILENKO had been attended to at once and had received proper treatment
he would have lived. He also told me that he had been shot in the back. He
was shot at about half past two (telephone call). The cart arrived in the camp
at half past three and when the doctor examined the Russian it was about five
minutes past four. The Russian's place of work was about twenty minutes walk
from the camp. Other prisoners told me when they returned that GRILENKQ had
been found in a hayrick in a farm about a further fifteen minutes walk fron the
place of work and had been shot there.﻿Sheet 2.

Deposition of Josef MiiUWhiNN
After the doctor had told ae this I v/ent back to ray office.
KLINGER, who had gone out of the gate when I went away with the doctor,
returned about fifteen rainutes later in order to take roll-call. Since
I had seen the prison nuaber of the Russian I went to ray card index to
ascertain his narje. I did not see the Russian again until I went to roll-
call at half past four. This tine I noticed that the working-parties
had been halted outside the gate. GRIEM instructed the four interpreters,
a Russian, a Dutchman, a Frenchman and a pole, that they were to inform the
other prisoners that, if they attempted to escape, the sane fate would befall
then as that of the Russian lying.at the gate. He gave further instructions
that each prisoner must look at the corpse and whoever did not do so would
receive 25 blows with a stick. They then narohed through the gate, past the
dead nan and each had to look at the corpse which was lying to the left of
the gate. Those who did not look to the left were struck on the face by
KLINGER. This happened five or six tines/When the prisoners had passed by,
the medical orderlies, who had to stand at the gate during roll-call, undressed
the corpse. I was also present because I had the keys of the cell where he
was to be taken later While we were undressing him* the corpse was laid on
its front and I saw that the wounds on the back were smaller than those in
the chest. I was quite sure that he had been shot in the back. The corpse
was badly battered, especially in the face. I saw the Russian for the
last tine when he was buried :two days later.

I -was arrested for the first tine for high treason in February 1933.
I was released, and on 11th April 1933 imprisoned again. I cane to
NEUENGAMME in the summer of 1941. There I was first employed in the kitchen
and later in the bath house. On the 28th September 1944 I went into the
HUSUM-LADELUND Aussenkonmando. There I was kitchen kapo. On the 30th
January 1945 I went to DALLUlvl-IEPREN, also as kitchen kapo.
In DALLUM, in the beginning of February 1945, a prisoner was shot in the
back by the guards whilst trying to escape. This prisoner, a Russian named
GRILENKO, was brought back into the camp in the afternoon by the Blockfuehrcr
KLINGER. I was standing obliquely to the Lagerfuehrer’s room, Untersturn-
fuehrer Hans GRIEM, some 10 metres away, together with the camp elder KAUFMANN.
The trolley with the Russian drove up to GRIEM’s house. There KLINGER alighted
and went into the Lagerfuehrer1s office. Then he cane out again. He dragged
the wounded Russian from the trolley. I could see from the Russian's
movements that he was still alive. He raised his head and held his back where
he had the shot wounds. GRIEM also cane out and wanted to talk to the
Russian. As the latter obviously could not reply, GRIEM began to kick him in
the stomach and on the chest. At the sane tine KLINGER strucic him with a
wooden truncheon on the head. This lasted about five minutes. I was then able
to observe that the Russian was no longer moving. I then went back to the
kitchen and KAUFMANN to the dead nan. In the evening when the Kommandos were
returning at about half past five I saw the dead man lying on the ground in
front of the gate. Blockfuehrer KLINGER and GRIEM were standing by and saying:
"Have a look. This happens to anyone who wants to get away’," I saw the dead
man again the same evening in the morgue. His face was covered with blood.
I also saw several shot wounds in the back.

Investigation Team at HAMBURG, on 13th Docenber 19^5.
I was arrested in COTTBUS on 1st Hay 194-1 for political reasons.
I was first of all two years in the central prison in BERLIN-TEGEL.
From there I went to NEUENGiAtHE in 194-3. In September 1944- I was in
the HUSUM Aussenkommando. I worked there outside the camp. Then I
became bodily weak and from the beginning of October 194-4- I was in the
potato peeling kitchen.
One day in October 1944- I was working in the potato peeling kitchen
with about 50 other prisoners. It was about half past two, and I heard
the alarm sounding for parade. Me cane out of the kitchen to fall into
five ranks. Several of the prisoners were very ill and could not go
quickly up the steps of the kitchen to the square, Untorsturmfuehrer^Hans
GRIM was standing”about 20 netres away from the prisoners coming out
and shouted at them, "Tempo'. Tempo! Dallii Dalli'." to make them fall
in quicker. Then GRIM took his pistol from its holster, shot once into
the air and twice into the crowd of prisoners without aiming. One prisoner,
the Russian Wanka MIKDLAJEW, whom I knew very well and who had been standing
3 netres next to me, fell down and remained there lying in a cramped position
with his arm on his bafek. Another prisoner, the Pole STASCJEK (l don't know/
his surname) who was the foreman in the potato peeling kitchen, was standing
one and a half metres away from me. He had just been busy counting us. nfter
the shots had gone off, he held his hand and cried, “Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus,
He went a few paces back and lent against the wall of the kitchen where he
held his left hand. The sole Blockfuehrer from HUSUM then sent everybody
back into the kitchen. I also went back.
After ten minutes I went out to get a few knives ground I went behind
the windows of the Revier to see what was the matter with ny comrade. Through
the window I could see the Russian, MIKOLAWJEw, who was dead on a stretcher.
The dead man was wearing no shirt, and his coat and jacket did not cover the
wound, which I could see. There was a small hole under his heart. I could
not discern any blood. As I was peering through the window I saw the
Blockfuehrer putting potatoes into the coat pocket of the dead man. Then I w^ent
back to the kitchen. The Pole who had been shot at came back soon afcorwards
from bandaging. He had a big bandage round his arm, which he was wearing in a
sling. In the evening, about half past five, when the prisoners were
returning from outside work, the Russian MIKOL/iWJE'J was lying on a stretcher
in front of the gate. The Polish foreman HENRIK stood near the dead man and kept
on shouting; "This man stole potatoes and has been shot for it.

Russian MIKQLAJEW is dead". Then I asked him, "Where did he get the shot?"
The dead nan was not clothed in a shirtj only his jacket and overcoa-t

me the shot. I observed that the wound was under the heart, and I
could see for myself that the Russian was dead. The polish prisoner
who had been shot at was being bandaged at this time on tho operating
table. He had a shot through the left wrist. Afterwards I went back

I joined the Nazi Party on the 30th March 1930 and the SS on 1st
October 1931. In the year 1937 I was an Untersturafuehrer.	I went

I was e[.ployed not only in the uain canp but also in AussenkOiXiandos.
Fron August to the 1st Deccnbor 1944 I was corxiandant of the Aussenkoixiando
in HUSUM, that is, I was the senior officer and had under ne Oberscharfuehrer
EICHLER as Lagerfuehrer as well as Blockfuehrer KLINGER.
One day in October 1944 I cane fro FLENSBURG to HU&UIvi to inspect the
canp there. I arrived about nidday, had sonething to eat there, and then
wanted to drive off after the afternoon parade. I was in somewhat of a
hurry as a car was supposed to fetch ne fron the canp; but before
setting off I wanted to know the canp strength. As it took a very long
tine for the physically weak people the "Musoliaenner" - to cone fron the
potato-peeling kitchen to the parade ground, I tookjay Walther 765
pistol and fired three shots into the air, thinking that this would bring
the people quicker on to the parade ground. I was standing about 40 to
50 netres away fron the potato-peeling kitchen when I fired the shots.
X then went away. At the gate X was ta.Iking for another ten to

Deposition on oath of Anders Thomsen, male, Norrebrogade 122, Kobenhavn
N« Denmark, si/orn before Ronald ./alter Rose Oapt,, Essex Regiment of No* 2
'far .Crimes Investigation Team, at Copenhagen on March 15th 1946.
I am 23 years old of Danish Nationality, born at Aaling pr. Molby,
Denmark. I am at present living at Norrebrogade .122, Copenhagen, Denmark,
which is my permanent home.
I was arrested on April the 1?th 1944 for political activity. Prom the
27th of September until the 16th of December 19^4 I was at HUSUM a-rbeitskommando
attached to the concentration camp of NEUENGAMME near HAMBURG.
During this time I witnessed every day episodes of terrible brutality.
But as it is more than a year and a half since these things happened.it is
difficult to select any particular event from such a period of constant
torture and misery, I have forced myself to forget as much as possible in
order to.save ny nerves.
But I remember very wall indeed the following two occurrences, which
I witnessed while at HUSUM:
1» At the beginning of November 1944;* 3 or 4 prisoners, as far. as I
remember they were Dutchmen, were accused of stealing food from the kitchen;
they were heavily beaten in the camp (l do not remember by whom) and were
locked in for the night without clothes in a little hut where the bodies
of the prisoners who had died the day before, were kept.
The following morning they were taken with us to the place where we
worked, and set to work as a special team called "Strafkonpagnie" under the
command of a Kapo named Nilli DEHMER, who I now recognise as the person on
■the photograph Numbered A 24* He was well known as one of the "worst
characters in the camp. The Strafkompagnie were set to work at a very bad
place ’where there ’was a tremendous amount of mud and slime. Even a well-
fed. and well-clothed, person would have found the work almost impossible under
normal circumstances, but the prisoners ’were obliged to work there for 12
hours a day although they were, in a very low state of starvation. It ’Was a
very rough and cold day and they were obliged to work in no other clothes
than a pair of trousers, a, thin shirt and. 0. pair of wooden shoes.
I v/as working about 30 metres from this place and could both see and
hear how Willi DEHMER was treating his Strafkompagnie. He shouted and
cursed them all the time and at short intervals he took them up and gave
them 20 to 30 blows with his rubber truncheon. If one of them fell while
he was being beaten DEHMER kicked them until they stood up again.
They were not only ill-treated by Willi DEHMER. The cries of the victims
attracted the other Kapos like a magnet. They joined in eagerly with the
punishment oftthe prisoners. Martin TENZ whom I now recognise on the photo
marked A*167; Alfred, Franz and Harry (the latter's prison.number was 1714)
I do not remember their other names, paid, particular attention 'to the
Strafkompagnie. They beat, kicked and maltreated the prisoners until they
were quite mad with pain and were more like animals than human beings.
It was not at all necessary for the Kapos to illtreat the prisoners in
this way. They were not punished by the SS for not doing so. The SS were
content as long as the ’work was finished when the day v/as over. The only
reason the Kapos had for illtreating the prisoners v/as to amuse themselves
and satisfy their sadistioal minds.﻿- 2 -
As far as I remember this went on for one or two days and each night the
prisoners were locked up with the dead bodies* nt about 2 or 3 o'clock one
afternoon the following thing happened!
One of the prisoners wno could not bear his illtreatment any longer
began to run across the field in an odd mannerj and though he 'were in a
trance. One of the guards - who were German Marinen-Infanteristen - took
up his rifle. I saw some other prisoners try to stop him but Martin T^NZ
shouted to them "Laufen'lassen" (Let him go)_although he knew thattne
prisoner would, be shot by the guard. The prisoner ran on j jumped into a
small stream and swam across it. Those of us who were watching were surprised
to see him do this as he was obviously insane. At the other side of the
stream he ran on and one of the soldiers fired, at himj and he fell to the
ground.
He was carried back to the working place. He was not quite dead and. I
saw the Kapo named Harry kicked him in the head. I think the other Kapos
did so as well but I do not remember distinctly.
On about the 26th of November 19A4 I became sick, and was put in the
mvier, ip- i.i^e.^pame room as one of the above prisoners. He had severe. ,
-irtfiama4xorr.-df-ijxe lung and was quite mad. . The other patients said he had
been in this condition all the time.
A few days afterwards, he died.
2» On a rainy day towards the end, of October 1944- one of the Danish .
prisoners whose name was Hans ASTRUP was illtreated by the Kapo Frantz in^
such a way that he died a few days afterwards. It happened in the following
manner:
Our work on this day was almost impossible. We were supposed to dig
tank traps to a depth of about 3 metres but the ground was no wet and muddy
that we could not dig anything out of it. The Kapos became more and more
hysterical. Franz paid special attention to the Danes. I nyself received
10 to 15 blows from his rubber truncheon.
At last Franz became so angiy that he accused all the Danes of sabotaging
the work and called us all up from the place where we were working and hit us
violently in our forces with his fists 3 or 4 times, I received 4 olows
myself.
Although we fell to the ground we were not allowed to lie there. The
Kapo Harry kicked and beat us back to our work.
My friend, ASTRUP who stood beside me after we had been called up was
hit so violently by.Franz on his oheek, that his jaw was broken. In
evening he was sent to the revier but the doctors had.no means of helping
him.
He died a few days afterwards.
I have made this statement' in English which language I understand
perfectly.

Deposition on' oath of: Eric, Noy, Nurt, L/jjKERT (Male) of S^ormvej 6^,
Bronshoj, Copenhagen. Sworn before Ronald Valter lose, Captain, The 'ssex
Regt., of No. 2 War Crimes Investigation Team, at Copenhagen, on March 14	>
1946.
I an 32 years of are, born Tientsin, North China, of Danish Nationality.
I am at present living at Smorumvej 65, Bronshoj, which is my permanent, ione.
I was arrested for illegal activity and handed over to the Gestapo on
the 10th May 194-3, and was in prison for 3 months. I was again arreste on
the 24th of January 1944- "At the beginning of October 1944 I ^
from HEUENGS0/1E concentration camp to one of its laoour camps at SCn.aA.
HUSUM.
At the beginning of November the sane year 3 prisoners whose names I d
not remember were very severely beaten and lociced up m the hut where the dea
bodies were stored, for the whole night. As a result of this, oy the
following day they were half crazy and very veeK.
In spite of this they were forced to go out with one of the worKing parties
as usual.
They were made to woric in one of the worst possible places, under^the
most severe conditions. Water and mud came up to their waists, ana it wa
almost impossible to vorK properly, even for fit men.
The following Kapos: Alfred LEVY, Willi DEMERT, Martin and Henry (I do
not Know the surnames of the last two) paid special attention to the aoove
prisoners. Willi DEMERT shouted and beat them mtb a rubber truncheon s
badly that they became completely mad. They were oilowed not a single momen
of respite, every time they attempted to rest, or showed signs of collapsing
the Kapo beat them even worse. They were howling and crying liKe animals ana
were no longer normal human beings.
Now and again they were taKen out of the ditch which they were di^jin -nu
made to bend over, whereupon the other Kapos beat them again, .especially .
Then they were KicKed bacK into the ditch.
One of them began to run about- I watched him and I am sure he did not
Know- what he was doing or tbwere he was going. I saw one of the guards r^<.^
his rifle, and aim at the running figure because he was heading towards tic
boundary line of the area in which we were worKing.
Some men made an attempt to stop him, but one of the Kapo., I thinK it
was DEMERT, called out that the prisoner was not to be stopped. As cie
prisoner passed over the line the guard fired and the prisoner xell dead.
I-
This was deliberate murder, because the Kapos delioerately tormented
the prisoner intil he ran away, knowing full well that he would be shoe,
made"no attempt to atop him, and even prevented others from doing so.
The other two prisoners were taKen bacK to toe camp and placed in the
reider.	I assisted the doctors in the evenings and was able to see what
happened.	‘	6
﻿-2-
They had been so badly beaten that their bones showed b'nrough their
flesh, and they wore absolutely out of their mind.
They died one or two weOKs afterwards.
One of those prisoners was only about 13 years old.
I have made this statement in English, which language I understand
perfectly.

Sir,
I, the undersigned, have been detailed^to prosecute in_the
above case which is due to start on 15 August 46. On considering
the papers in the light of information received from A (PS.4) this
HQ about the escape from custody of some of the accused, I beg to.
suggest that the	prosecution of this	case should be postponed	until
all, or at least	most of the accused	are available	for trial.
This case was submitted to LONDON for advice on 7 Junn 46•
The JAG‘s- Advice	to C-fc., BAOR., was	dated 14 June	46, and this	advice
was forwarded to	HQ Hamburg District	by A(PS.4) on	8 July 46.
According to that advice the following accused persons were
stated to be in custody as under:
/ GRIEM
EICHLER -
SCHNEIDER
^ TENZ
DEMMER
TUEMMEL
^ KLINGER
x GUENTHER
-JACOBS
No. 5 CIC
No. 1 CIC
No. 6 CIC
No. 1 CIC
No. 1 CIC
No. 1 CIC
No. 101 CIC
No. 101 CIC
No. 101 CIC
It was reported on 30 July 46 that during the night 29/30
July 46 the u/m.tescaped from No. 1 CIC..
On 6
TENZ
' DEMMER
On 6 August 46 I was informed by telephone from.A(PS.4) that
the accused GRIEM.had escaped. A(PS.4) had received this information
by telephone.and have not yet had confirmation m writing.
I am also informed that the exact location of
GUENTHER
JACOBS
is not known but they are believed to be still in custody in a CIC.
Steps are being taken to ascertain their whereabouts.
The position as regards the accused is that today, 7 August
46, a week before the trial is due to begin,
GRIEM )
TENZ ) Are not in custody
.DEMMER )
GUENTHER) Are believed to be in custody but their
JACOBS ) exact location is uncertain.
The reasons for which I suggest that the trial is postponed
are as follows
The case is presented as one of ill-treatment and murder of
Allied nationals in four Aussenkommandos of NEUENGAMME, namely,
/page 2..﻿-2-
HUsSi, LADELUliD, DALUM and VERSEN, and consists of four separate parts;
1. General conditions in all four camps leading to widespread
disease and deaths: Responsibility for this is attributed to
GRIEM who was at one time or other Gonmjandant of each camp,
and when all camps were in existence at the same time, Command-
ant of the group of camps. The other accused were members of
of the camp staff and Kapos at these camps, and have a share
of responsibility for conditions and treatment in them.
2.& 3. Murder of individual internees by GRIEM, assisted in one case
by the accused KLINGLER.
4.	Ill-treatment and murder of internees by Kapos;
DEMMER
TENZ
REICKEL
LEVY
ROEHLER, and others.
It will be appreciated that GRIEM is the principal offender,
and though parts 2 and 3 above are separate_incidents which could be
removed from the case as a whole, this man is inextricably connected
with the first part of the case which involves the majority of the
other accused.
As regards part 4, none of the men responsible are available
for trial.
Of the accused definitely in custody, only KLINGLER is involved
in a particularly serious offence? the others (and this may be extended
to include GUENTHER and JACOBS) are only implicated as responsible
for the general conditions.
•
Accordingly it would be impossible to prosecute only those
available to stand trial and another trial would have to be arranged
on the recapture of GRIEM and the others.
In addition to other administrative difficulties which would
be caused by this, there vrould be the question of securing the attend-
ance of Danish v/itnesses for the second occasion.
I therefore submit that on legal and administrative grounds
this case should not on any account be prosecuted in.the absence of
GRIEM, and if possible not until all the accused advised xn the minute
of the JAG dated 14 July 46 are available.

1.	The above named was a principle witness for the
Prosecution of Neuengamme IV (Husurn, Dalum etc.,) and was
held in spite of his urgent desire to be repatriated to
Poland.
2.	The Trial was postponed when the chief accused
GRIEM absented himself from custody: in four months GRIEM
has not been arrested and it is considered improper to
detain SIEmlONKO any longer.
3. Before he is repatriated, however, his address
in Poland.should be ascertained In case it is necessary
to recall him.

in the Conoentratlon Camp NEUENGAMMB from 21st January 1941 to 2nd May 1945.
From March 1941 until Deoeriber 1941 I was employed in the "Elbe" Commando,
Obersoharfuehrer MiiRQUART was at that time Commandofuehrer of that Commando.
He was known among the internees as "ELBE KOENIG" (Elbe King) because he was
given unlimited powers by Commandant WEISS, All new-arrivals (foreigners
and Jews) were made to work in that Commando, because it was the heaviest
work. Among the internees the Elbe Commando was known as the death Commando,
Every day we had two or three deaths which were brought about by the heavy
work, and the way in which Commandofuehrer MARQUART illtreatcd and drove
prisoners to work. It was generally known in the camp that whenever a
Blookfuehrer did not wish to see a certain internee any longer, MARQUART
received instruction in the morning that the internee was not to be brought
back alive. This happened quite often. In connection with this I would
like to describe the following incidents:
In the summer 1941 the Pole WLADEK KASEMIR was severely beaten 3 or 4 times
in the course of the day by Command of uehrer MARQUART so that returning in.
the evening we had to carry him back to the camp as a corpse. His offence
was that he worked too little in the eyes of the Commandofuehrer and that
after every illtreatment he could do still less work* Apart from that e
specially "loved" Jews. They had to push the fully loaded trolleys a
distance of 8000 metres to the tip-heap at the double. If one of the
trolleys jumped out of the rails at one of the maixy curves, the four Jews
had to put it back on the rails in quick time to the blows and illtreatment
of the Commandofuehrer. On these occasions one or two often remained
unconscious on the ground. Those men were again brought to their feet by th
Commandofuehrer with one or two buckets of Elbe water and furthermore were
kicked. In September 1941 in this way we brought back three Jewish comrades
dead to the camp.
In September 1941 internees had to take sand from a boat on to the land by
means o? a wheelbarrow. They had to push it at the double over a narrow
plank. In this work one Polish comrade fell with his wheelbarrow into the
Elbe. Those comrades who had witnessed this incident and rushed up to
help their comrade were threatened by the Commandofuehrer wi P •
He shouted: "The Polish bandit will come out on his own after the bath .
The Pole concerned drowned in the Elbe. After searching for two hours his
body was recovered.
Commandofuehrer MARQUART, nicknamed NAPOLEON, belonged to the SS. He was
brutal and pityless and beat internees with any object that came in his
hands until they remained on the ground.

My name is Fritz SCHOEN, I an Goman, bom on 4th January, 1899.
Froa June 1942 until 2nd May 1945, I 'was a political prisoner in the
Concentration Camp NEUENGAI/EiE.
Every internee who was delivered into IMJENGAMIIE had to go to the
Elbo Comando at first. At that tine it was one of the most feared
Commandos. It was under the command of Oberscharfuehrer MARQUART, who
was known by the nickname of NAPOLEON, and who behaved himself very
brutally towards interness in that Comando. The .lost severe
illtreatnent was the order of the day. In connection with this I would
like to mention two specially terrible cases, where two Jewish comrades were
the victims.
It was approximately in the autumn of 1942, when I was working in the
Klinker works, digging the canal, I observed how NAPOLEON brought two
Jewish comrades with kicks and blows to their feet, who had collapsed
through exhaustion. The result was that in spite of the blows of the
Oberscharfuehrer the two were not in a condition to carry on with their work.
They collapsed again, wore carried away, but. lay in the open until the
end of the work for that day. When the Commando returned the two Jews
were carried into the camp by other comrades and delivered into the sick
bay. About 14 days later I ms told by another internee that one of the
two Jews had died from his injuries.
At the same time another Commando consisting only of Russians was
also working with the Elbe Commando. At first this Russian Comando
consisted of about 100 men but after about 3 months it had shrunk to 34 men.
The missing 66 Russians had all died through too heavy work, undernourishment
and severe illtreatnent.
I also remember another incident which occurred in autumn 1942. Various
internees wore employed in carrying stones. One Polo carried those stones
and apparently could not keep up the rate of work prescribed by the
Oberscharfuehrer. As this Pole was carrying one of the stone HAEQUART cacao
up behind him and kicked him in the thigh. The Pole fell to the ground.
Unfortunately he hit his head on a heap of stones and cut open the left side
of his head. He was left lying there until the end of the work when he
was taken to the sick-bay. It was about 6 weeks before he was released
from the sick-bay.

Deposition on oath of Max	roale, of FRAUSTiiDT/Nie-
dorsohlcsion, sworn before Major Anton Walter FREUD ( Gen. List, of
War Crimes Investigation Unit at NEUENGAilE on IX-th Junc}
I an Max iiAEKWAET, born on 17th January, 1889, at FRAUSTADT/
Niederschlesien, cart wright by profession and of G-ernan nationality.
In March 1932 I joined the NSDAP and in November of the same
year the S3. At the end of April of 1940 I cane to the rEUENGAMME-
Coneentration Camp as on Unterscharfuehrer, and I stayed there until
the end of the war.
From 1941 to Winter 1912, nearly 2 years, I was Commando Leader
of a working party known under the nano "Elbe I”. This party was
employed to make navigable a oanal of the Elbe. Our work consisted
in removing mud which a dragger had collected from the oanal. The
party consisted at first of 20 prisoners but it increased and at the
end about 300 to 400 prisoners worked under my command. In Command
there worked a number of German and also member of all other nationalities.
I was known among the prisoners under the nickname "MPOIEON".
I maintain that during my work with the "Elbe" working party I never
had opportunity to beat prisoners or to illtreat then, in any other way,
the only punishment which was allowed was withdrawal of the second helping.
It is unknown to me that the Pole VLADEK Kasimir was beaten by me in
Summer 1941 so badly, that when the parties were returned to the Camp in
tho evening, he was taken along as a corpse. I neither know that I have
driven prisoners to vrork so hard until they fell down unconscious.
It was one of tho duties of tho "Elbe" Commando to empty sand
barges by moans of push carts which had to be pushed by the prisoners over
a board, which lay from the barge to the quai. It is unknown to me that
on such an occasion a Polish prisoner foil into the Elbe and was drowned
as I did not permit to have him saved. It is not true that I have beaten
prisoners with all kinds of implements.
In Autumn 1942 a Commando of approximately 100 Russians worked in my
party for some 3 months. As I daily got 100 prisoners I do not know how
many of the original 100 Russians were still alive after the 3 months, as
now prisoners were always sent for anybody who had died.
I cannot remember to have kicked with my boots from behind, a Polish
prisoner carrying stones.

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms." simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other prehminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(а)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(б)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

NOTES ON THE CASE
? /
(Under this heading should be included the view taken as to (a) the degree of
responsibility of the accused in view of his official position, e.g., was offence
committed on the offender’s own initiative, or in obedience to orders, or in carrying
out a system approved by authority or a legal provision ; (6) the probable defence;
(c) whether the case appears to be reasonably complete.)
The accused appears to have acted entirely on his ov».t initiative except
that he says that the nail device was installed in the ciair on wie rcders
of i . p non • font. He blames his actions on the stats of its nerves
aiie res he only et;© ' out ill-treatnaent to those who .ade folse state.rents

Team at Hamburg on 27th February 1946.
I was arrested for the first tine in June 1933
at DUESSELDOKF. I wad released in December 1933
and. imprisoned again in January'1934. On 21st '
April 1935 I was released and imprisoned again
on 2nd July 1935. * In 1936 I cane to the con-
centration comp S^OHSENHiAUSEN, from there I was
sent to the concentration Gamp NEUENGAMiJE
on 4th June 1943.
Oberscharfuhrer ERNST was a photographer
in the Ericennungsdienstj he was occupied
in the Sta.bsbaracke of the concentration camp
NEUENGAMME. " In 1942 I wa-s pa.inter-Kapo and
during the renewal of the Stabsbaracice, I had
often opportunity to watch ERNST at his worn.
His photographer’s chair had a device, a
sharply pointed nail, which jerned up when
he stepped on a lever, so that this sharp
object penetrated the bottom of the victim
concerned. This was one of his passions.
Another one was to throw prisoners by niens
or sudden pushes against the walls.
One day'in April 1942 the Polish prisoner BAR
was thrown out from the photographers room
into' the.passage. The face above his right
eye was beaten open, so that the blood was
streaming over his face. This wound was
caused by ERNST, by beating his face against
the walli He was then called ba.cic by ERNST
into the'photographer's room, after which
one could hear calls for help, which gave
evidence of illtreatment. One minute later'
the door was flung open and BAR was again
thrown across the passage into the room
situated opposite,where the painters were
Woricing, His face was covered with blood.
In the roam we, the painters, washed him
as far as we could.
The illtreateient of the Pole HAR had not been
a singular case, but I want particularly to
emphasize that he treated all newly arriving
prisoners,.whom he had to photograph in
the same manner or even worse*﻿Production No» 204

I was arrested on the 30th.September 1939 by
the LEIPZIG Gestapo for being an enemy of the
State and for listening and spreading foreign
wireless bulletins. From the 30th June 40 till
3rd May 45 I was in the Concentration Camp
NEUENG1JME as a political prisoner. Pith excep-
tion of the first 4 months I was employed the
whole time as camp cleric. It was part cf my work
at times, to take newly arrived prisoners to the
identification department SS"Qberscharfuehrer
Albert ERNST to be photographed. I was very often
in his duty room in the Stabsbaracke and I have
seen that he illtreated out of principal every
single prisoner. He had a construction built in
the chair the prisoners were to be photographed
on, which he operated with a. foot pedal. Uhen
pressing this pedal, an 8 cm long nail was ejected
from the bottom of the chair, which penetrated
into the behind of the thereupon sitting prisoner.
His beating equipment consisted of a leather whip
and 3 or 4 truncheons of various strengths.
I remember a Pole Felix LEYAdTOOv/'SKI, who was
brought in in January or February 1943* I saw
how ERNST shouted at lEJANDOV/SKI and how he was
beating him without consideration with a thick
truncheon on the head and into’ the face, until
he was hardly able to stand straight and eventually
collapsed. Two other prisoners had to get hold of
IBTANDOUSKI under his arms and carried him outside
streaming with blood,
I also remember the Russian MITTALIJ R0MAN0WSKIJ,
an officer of the Red Army, who was sent in June 44
from the LUENEBURG Gestapo to NEUENGAMME. Whilst
photographing him, ERNST illtreated that prisoner
With kicks into his belly, when he was already on
the ground and hammered away with a thick stick on
his face, hands and scull. His face and body were
completely swollen and he could, not see out of his
eyes anymore. He was supposed to go to the sick-bay,
but he had to go to work immediately and he died the
some evening in consequence of the illtreatment of﻿Both cases

On the 1 st. of August 1939 I was arrested and,
interned for political reasons. From 1st March
1940 till the 30th April 1945 I was in NEUENGBCIE.
I know the atrocities of SS-Obcrscharfuehrcr
Albert EHN3T especially well, as I was employed in
the 8tabsba.ra.cke,
I remember one particular case, one of very few.
It wa.s beginning of June 1943. I saw with my own
eyes, how one Jew whose name I forgot, was beaten
up to such an extent with a stick, fists and kicks
freo Albert ERNST, that he died a few days later
of interior injuries. As a witness I can give Emil
ZUIEGER, a co-prisoner, who was employed with me*
Emil ZULEGER's Address is: Guentherstr. 44, I,
mjjPHEBEBG.
I_have seen with my own eyes, how Obersoharfuehrer
ESN8T illtror.tcd all new arrivals (daily) of Russians
and Poles to such an extent that they left his room
with bleeding heads and not being able to stand on
their feet. Afterwards I spoke to several of the
victims and they said that they would ra.ther commit
suicide than to enter again ERNOT's room, so great
was their fear of the inhuman treatment of that man*
I have scon at the beginning of April 1942 haw one
Polo with the name of HAS. or BABN came flung out from
the photo-room to the corridor. He had a gaping wound,
oyer the right eye. He got it having been hit by ERNST
with Ins fist into the face and was flung against the
wall. He was called back again and shouts for help could
be heard. He was thrown out again .after a time with
blood pouring down his fa.ee. First aid was rendered by the
painters. Such eases were normal daily routine with
Albert ERNST.

Oberpfalz, Got tclacubio, plu.ibcr, of Gera rax nationality.
I joined the 88 in IvIUNICK in 1933, but before that trac
had nothing to do with politics. On the 6th of Decaabor
■!!933 I was sent t o the Concentration Caxap DjiCibiU for
uHitary training, isaa assigned to a:,aiuim and had to
do gentry duty. I did this ^ob until Spring 1935, then
I becanc ill and for this reason ivas-. transferred to- the
Goanandantur .DAGflAU as.r.a telephone ojjcrdtpr.,- This job
I	did until spring 1938 and 'svaa tjxcn sent to the Politi-
schc. Abteilung DAGIiiU. There I noriccd in the Ilegistry
Office until the 30th April 1940, At that tine I was
transferred to the Concentration Canp MOTENG/JvfiE, where I
worJeod again in the Politioebo Abteilung (Aegistry Office)
■until the Autmn 1940. About this tine the Erhennungsdienst
(identity Service) was fornod, and I worked there right
fron the beginning as photographer until the 6th March 1943.
Then I had to .report to the Eastern Front and,had since then
ho uorc to do with Concentration Canps. In the Erkennungs-
dionst in NEUEWGJil.lE’ I was Schnrfuohrcr since the Auturxn
of 1940 and becanc Obcrscharfue'ixrcr in Autunn 1941. My job
in this service wae to photograph newly arrived-prisoners,
of when no photographs were yet existing, and on the
special order" of Aiy Departaont Chief, I had to take finger-
prints- of the prisoners. I photographed: Gcroan prisoners
an well'as Polos, Slussians, Dutchoon, ..and Belgians,
II	can ranenber that I hit prisoners in ny roon, but I
never used a truncheon or ,a whip or any. other weapon*
I hit then only rarely with ray fist, neatly only with'
ny flat, hand, and I an not aware that prisoners have
died in consequence of >:y blows. It is not impossible
that I have at tines pushed prisoners with their heads
•against the wall, but if their■faces wore bloody, it
can only be for the reason that their noses wore blood-
ing because of ray blows.
On the orders of the forncr carap corxiandont Martin VJEISS
0 needle point was installed in the chair, on which the
prisoners were photographed. This was in Winter 1940/41,
This needle point could be raised suddenly by a pull on
d. lever, so as to nake the prisoners . got up quickly* but
this contraption never worked well and was disraantlcd after
10 - 14 days.﻿->2'

April 1935 I was released and imprisoned again
on 2nd July 1935. In 1936 I came to the con-
centration camp SACHSEKHAUSEH, from there I was
sent to the concentration Camp HEUEUGAMilE
on 4th June 1940.

in the Stabsbaracke of the concentration camp
NEUEUGAMIiF. In 1942 I %vas painter-KapO and
during the renewal of the Stabsbaracke, I had
often opportunity to watch ERNST at his work.
His pLotographer's chair had a device, a
sharply pointed nail, which jerked up when
he stepped on a lever, so that this sharp
object penetrated the bottom of the victim
concerned. This was one of his passions.
Another one was to throw prisoners by kicks
or sudden pushes against the walls.
One day in April 1942 the Polish prisoner HAR
was thrown out from the photographers room
into the passage. The face above his right
eye was beaten open, so that the blood was
streaming over his face. This wound was
caused by ERNST, by beating his face against
the wall. He was then called back by ERNST
into the photographer's room, after which
one could hear cails for help, which gave
evidence of illtreatment. One minute later
the door was flung open and EAR was again
thrown across the passage Into the room
situated opposite, where the painters were
working. His face was civered with blfeod.
In the room we, the painters, washed him
as far as we could.
The Illtreatment of the Pole HA1 had not been
a singular case, but I want particularly to
emphasise that he treated all newly arriving
prisoners, whom he hr!d to photograph in
the same manner or even worse.﻿Production No«

REPORT
by
Grimes Investigation Unit B.A.O.R.
on
SS-Obersoharfuehrer Albert ERI'fSI1
1.	A section of the administrative branch of the NEUER-
G-AMME Concentration Camp was the Identity section (E.n
kennungsdienst), which like all other administrative
departments was housed in the Staff quarters (Stabs-
haracke).
2.	It was the duty of the Identity Section to photo-^
graph and fingei'-print new Concentration Caiap arri-
vals.
3.	In charge of the Identity Department was Oberschar-
fuehrer Albert ERNST. The SS managed to introduce
their customary cruelty even into this minor admini-
strative department, which will be elaborated in the
case against ERNST.
PER30NALIT IBS:
4. Albert ERNST joined the SS in May 1933 and. the Toten-
kopf Units on the 6th December 1933, i»e* he must have
been a very early member of this Unit. He first served
in DACHAU Concentration Camp as a guard, and later in
the Political Department. In April 1940 he came to the
NlUENGAMtffi Concentration Camp and from autumn of the
same year until he left the camp in March 1943 he worked
in the Identity Section.
CASE:
5. ERNST is accused of:
a)	being responsible for the general conditions
and the running of the NEUENGAMME Concentra-
tion Canp;
b)	murdering and illtreating a number of Allied
nationals.﻿2
PRESENTATION OP THB CASE:
6.	The witnesses chosen to give evidence in this
case Vi/ere not themselves subject to ERNST'S 'bru-
talities. Rather then chose any former NEOMGAf.KE
Concentration Camp inmate, who may have-been once
photographed by ERNST, it was deemed preferable
to chose witnesses who, by virtue of their work
in the administrative office, were able to ob-
serve ERNST’s activities, not on one particular,
'but on many, occasions.
7.	ERNST and his working methods were so feared by
all Concentration Camp inmates that in the words
of one witness "...they would rather commit sui-
cide than to be again subject to ERNST'S tortures."
Evidence collected shows that, apart from inflict-
ing grievious bodily harm, hij illtreatments have
resulted in at least one case of death.
8.
The best illustration of the sadistic nature of
the accused is the ingenious device with which
he used to maltreat the Concentration Camp inma-
tes. He installed a needle in the seat of the
chair, upon which prisoners sat when being photo-
graphed. This needle could be raised and made to
injure the prisoner by a small mechanical device.
SHORT REVIEW OP THE CASE:

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943f
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
■' by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
• i .	(«) ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
5'	priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
',,sA	to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
?	to send ‘‘Enclosure B.Ms.” .simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(a)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file;	^
(b)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

Report on the trial of Ferdinand arosse at Brunswick.
X. The arrangements made by 5 Div. were, as usual, excellent.
2.	The interpreting was good.
3.	There were very few civilian spectators. Hhis was
probably due largely to the fact that the accused was not
a local man.

i.'bjeoti- Hans SFTIlfP^TH. (wanted in oomection with the SOHAHDjfljAH oase).
On arri-val at Duesseldojrf, I went to see the Znt. Team in order to find out
the result of th© oensorship which was layed on by Sgt.
Hone of the personnel knew anything about the case at all and I was told
that if any censoi-ing mga was to be done the 1.1.0* should Imow sbo «t it* The
1.1.0* has never had anything to do with the case and so no records were kept
by thaul was sent back to the Int. Team and asked to see the G.C., who was
a Capt. Williams, He remembered the- cas® and also the premise made to Sgt,
Layboum. His explanation as to »hym no censorship had taken place ms that the
branch concerned ms too overworked to take on any more duties. When I asked
why this H.Q. had not been informed that the censorship could not be done at
the time, no explanation, was given, Irte® 1 also looked through all records of the
Xnt.Team, and there was no trace of SPIKMITH whatsoever.
The next morning, Isawfch® chief of th© Kripo, who ms also mentioned in Sgjfc,
Layboum’s report, to hear what he had done about this case, 1ms informed that
the people in question, had been screened by th© Kripo,, five or six times,
without any result • I iniaediately put a stop to that,lms told by th© Krlpo*
that the HPIHHRATH was the black sheep of the fatai3y, and that nobody mated
to have anything to do with with hits. The last member of his family to see his
ms his sister, which was in Sept, 1945, at which tins® k he said that he was
going to 3S©IiaH68lf (aossian ZGKe) to pick up his fsaily. His sister also said
that aS far as she knows, her brother has no fasdly.
T© trace a nan by the mm of TlWifeS (also mentioned in th© .report ) in
Saesselciorf, oet with m result, I also tried to find th© tall man and girl
seen fey Anau HOHHIdiM but again was unsuccessful.
As far as 1 could make out, all clues in Dusssoldorf (if there were any) had been
spoilt by the Kripo,, through having interrogaifcfe th® persons involved* and to I
the faot that th© cemorship had not bean caixied out,
Th® only thing left for a© in Duesseldorf ms th© following thing.
Attached to the wanted report was a ©hit of paper vu£hiMt,A* ) with
translation, which is a certificate made out by SklHKLc.'kii to GflLaf ru^)
see«rtifying a sale of his ear (stolen) ,
1 went t# see SPlHBRATH^s family, posdng as ¥0.11 dKAP»s irimS. and telling them,
after having shown tteaa ©pinnrath*s net®, that X still ewe hisa sosi© money and
that there were a fevs more things t* be arranged, Therefore it would be neoessaxy
t© get his address and would Jy they help me, Th© swmm. of Spironuth’S people
wasi * if we knew our 800*3 address, we would send it straight to the Soliee,
as he stolen everything from us that, was of value *, lassurod thm that I would
let thsri! know their son’s address if I should fir*! it.
As a result of these investigations, 1 have come to the following conclusions.
Th® H.lSflHGAMMB-SO!ftHDKL:liH ease has finished, and the eentenoea have bean
anmunced ovar the wirsless, I therefore ttednk that it is most likely, that if
SFIRNKM’H is in the BH2TI3H "UIS, navi would be th© iiaa for him to contact his
peopl*. Therefor© 1 suggest that we wait for a little while, in order to find out
the result of th© censorship, which has been laid on now, properly,
Xalso suggest that in future, wbrnovey ary exhibits are attached to a report,
it should be mentioned how and where they ■gfere obtained*

aub.1 ect; - SCHANDELAH case
1. Karl THJSCHEL* I proceeded to BBUNSWICK on Saturday July 7th.
Interrogated Artur GRDSSE, ex-overseer at SCHaUDELaH, also a man
called JAJIN, botti detained in the REl-UffiLBSHG PRISON. Learnt that
THJSQIEL lived at a place near L1HRTE called IMMENSSN.
Met §/Sgt. GOLDTWG of WAR CRIMES INVESTIGATION UNIT, who told
me iiiat he had arrested TMJSCHEL three or four days before at MOTSEN.
He placed him in BURGEORF jail and arranged for his transfer to 'TOMATO.".
2. Johann iPINNRAD. All efforts to trace SPINNRAD’s movements
after August 1945 having failed. I shall give all details obtained
both of S’lMNRAD's life before the war with addresses of relatives,
and of his manouvres.after the capitulation.
A) SPINNRA^was bora at HtETBT on the 10 Aug 1915. Most
of his relations seem to live at EUESSILIDHF. He himself
is on bad terms with mother, father, and sister. The set-up
in EBESSELDORF is as follows:-
1)	At 167. Koelnerlandstrasse:-
Wilhelm 3PINNRAD, fattier
Anna NEUENHAUSEN, sister
Carl NEUENHAUSEN, brother-in-law
Agnes BiCMAS (nee GLECENS) half-sister of Anna
2)	At 85. Birkenstrasse:-
Frau PESCH, and her husband
(Her name was once SEIBgRT, but first husband
is dead or divorced)
3)	At 42. Am Krahnap (Eller)
Herr DiMBACH, with his wife
Frau Elisabeth UMBACH (nee SEIBORT)
the dau^iter of Frau PESCH by her first husband
Elisabeth UMBACH lived with Johann SPINNRAD in 1942
and had a child that died. She heard from Frau NEUENHAUSEN
that EPINNRAD had been in DUESSELDORF in July-August 45.
But HD NOT see him.
4)	At An der Pewin. (Unterrath) 2\fFCi&L £7fX.
Katrina SPINNRAD, mother
(living apart from her husband for nearly 20 years)
5)	At 14. Ooladener Strasse
Frau BHJGMANN, friend of SPINNRAD. Very old.
6)	At 3. Nbsthofen Strasse
The SEILERS; he stayed in their flat in early August.
Not there with them. They knew nothing of the visit.
Also Frau HONNIGER, who saw him with a, tall man, and
a girl in the flat.﻿7) At BAECKBREI KDRITZSCH. KoeLnerlandstraaae
Acblf BRAJJN, landlord of Nosthof enstrasse 3.
a’JMRAD told his usual tale of being a
political Gone Camp victim to Adolf BRAUN
and the Billiting Offices, which was how he
g>t into the SEILER' a flat
SPINNRAD was a professional criminal before the war, in fact he
was put into Preventive Detention in July 1942 (photographs enclosed)
and later transferred to NECJENGAPME. He soon became a "LageraeLtester
He is described as having a hook nose, pale complexion, longish face
and dark brown hair.
He seems to have cheated and stolen from everyone he met.
Such victims include his friend Frau BHJGEEMANN from whom he stole
a shawl, and a man called Karl BERGS of IUEEEN whose motorcar he
stole. 3Ms car was later sold (see enclosed receipt) in BLOMBERG,
and for a time fulfilled firefighting duties in that town. Later
Mil Gov requisionad it, Karl BERGS had a dau^iter, Gerda BRANDI,
whose brother-in-law Adolf BRANDI and his wife IMA live at
27, am Berge, LUENgSURG. Gerda BRANDI is now at BRABEKCstrasse 16,
HANNDVSR-KIRCHRODE working for some British unit, Karl BERGS himself
lives at 27, SCKULSTRA3SS, IH2RM.
Kajrl TRiJSCHHL. Commandant of the Aussencommando SCHANDBLAH,
had girl friend who visited him at the canp, Kaethe LUEB3GK. She
lives at 15, SchinkeLstrasse, HAMBURG, and remembers nothing of
SPINNRAD.
The Cbmoaittee of Political Prisoners at HAMBURG has been
informed of SPINNRAD's habit of impersonating Cone Camp victim
and has promised to circulate enquiries.
B)	SPINNRAD left SCHANEELAH early July and wnt to
DUESSELDORF whore he stayed for a few days with a man
called TUBiMAS. He and Karl BERGS then left in a car
and 2PINNRAD returned alone after a week. He then said
to his family that he was going to LUSNBURG to collect
some friend cousin. Came back with a girl.
Then with TUEMMAS to HAHNENKLEE near QQ&AR
for kit. On the return journey brake down at BLOMBERG.
SPINNRAD stayed for a few days while TUMMAS rewturned
to UJESSELDORF. SPINNRAD then returned stayed in the
SSILER's flat for a day or two (see para A), then left
for BLOMBERG with a man from VELBSRT (probably the tell
man mentioned by Frau HONNIGER ( see para A). From then
on he disappeared, having stayed at a Gasthof in BLOMBERG
and I found no more trace of him. The car was not found for
over a year.
C)	It appears to me very likely that EPINNRAD slipped
quietly over into the Rissian Zone ; at any rate no more
leads remain to be followed by? no one I interviewed had
any idea of his whereabouts.﻿﻿RESTRICTED

WAR 0HBG3 Ef-S^RMTICII IjklT. BA'M.
PRISAMBLE:
1.	In 1944 the NgUERGAIftSB Concentration Coaip actadnistered approx.
50 detached working parties (Aussenkorrmndos). Those working
parties were erolo^red either by the Government - e.g. by the Arn$r
for digging anti-tank tranches - or by civilian firms whose work
was of national importance - e. r. The wK upp ” .Armourraent factory.
2.	One of the civilian firms which employed iMJMCAMfE Concentration
Gamp labour, was the STKDI03L GrabH (Btoneoil Ltd.), which later
had its name changed into Kalk- ana geraent-Werke (Lime & Cement
'works).	'
3.	This factory was situated at SCHffllBJXAH near BRlffioATCK and the
prisoners were acoommodated inside the factory area (see exhibit
"Plan").	'	•
4.	The prisoners were, as usual, guarded by the 33. The management
of the firm, however, was responsible for worldLng conditions etc.
.It oan be said that the SS and the civilian manogement of'the
fora were .jointly responsible for the ■well-being of the pri-
soners.
5.	The Steinoel Ltd. was founded in early 1944 and in May 1944 the
first prisoners from	started to work there.
6.	Applications for these prisoners and for all other subsequent
drafts were made y the aanageaent of the form (see e.dii >it
''letter"). The nuni'jers of prisoners rose from 50 to 8 ;0 in
Autumn 1944.
7.	In accordance with the usual customs of concentration camps,
prisoners were supervised by kapos (head ■prisoners) which were,
in 30a?sl'3B)3iAH, mostly recruited from -fee ranks of German pro-
fessional crindnals.
8.	In April 1945 when the Allied troops approached SCHiJiDSLAH the
prisoners were evacuated to W'G1SB'':SLIK, causing great tiardahips
to the victim®.
pRsswmoa g? :m gase:
9. This is the first "TMIi'MGM§ifS<i case in which an effort lias been
made to prove that not only the 33 and the kapoo were responsible
for the bad living conditions of the Concentration camp prisoners,
but that also the civilian demployers had their share in the ill-
treatment of the prisoners. The exhibits include a copy of a letter
confirming the agreement between the firm "Steinoel Ltd." and the
HMJ3»GAMME Concentration Camp. It provides for the provision﻿h
by the firm of the followings Accommodation, the piped water
supply and heating; free delousing of the acommodation, the
heddig and the clothing.
10.	She case is divided into:	.
a)	the general conations, -under which the
prisoners had to su 'er,
b)	12 generate in stances of illtreatraent	,
^ , '
11.	It is urgently recommended, that these 12 instances should^be
tried seoeftieiy from the general conditions (as it was done
in the WStJGRABMI-TISS’STiK Case). The instances which are quoted
•in this case are those for which the investigating o 'icer could
find suitable witnesses,and the prosecuting officer should
in mind that they, are not the only ones and that those specific
acts of murder and maltreatment should only serve to illustrate
the ge®s»l conditions, under which the prisoners of the
B3LM WorIcing Gamp had to suffer. It is recommended that tne
general' conditions and the 13 separate instances should he tried
as one case like the	Major".
12. The civilian management of the Steinoel Ltd. are, in the opinion
of the investigating officer, even more blameworthy than the • 3*
who guarded the prisoners. The latter being a military organisation,-
• may be able to claim that they acted on superior orders. The for-
mer, however, entirely voluntarily took part in t#* making
the life of the conctotration camp inmates even more miserable.
With a little good will 'they could have done much to ease the
lot of the prisoners.
f-MIRAL CCiroiTXdgSt
-TP, MeRTfeT.TTY SATE: Although the number of prisoners who dM as a
result of the"~onditions at SOEMTmm cannot be ascertained,
the death rate was very high, A total of 113 bodies of former
concentration can© prisoners were egm^from the Cemeteryl
In addition a number of dead bodieti»Mt removed to ISHISTTI,
vfiiere they were probably executed. Furthermore approx. 2CX) ___
sick prisoners were exchanged for healthy ones from. WEO b e-
and most of those who had been sent back died subsequently. “
One of the Exhibits is the register which was kept in the
sick-bay and comprises the period from 22nd Kov 1944- until
31st Dec 1944. It shows that out of a total of 700 to 800,
34 prisoners died during the month^ of December 19--i-4.
The raain reason for the high mortality rate was starvation.
At the beginning the firm ms responsible for the feeding or
the prisoners, and even the 39 Commandant JAIJGH^pointed out
that their rations v»re inadequate. The responsibility for
feeding the prisoners was passed to the 'on 22nd May 1944 ( 3se
exhibits "letter").

14. Tloe dally menu consisted of:
Morning:
Midday:
At night:
Bread ration:-
coffee
Approx 2 pints of soup, containing
turnip, sweeds, cor rotes, cabbage,
occasionally pototoes.
Either jam or a small piece of sausage,
gome times 15 to* 20 gra-ams of margarine.
500 gr daily' later 350 gr.
Part of the meagre rations of the prisoners were stolen by the
33 cooks.﻿3
35» Workixt!-; conditions: Most of the prisoners were employed
- *	oxi navvy work, but there were also some employed on skilled
work. ,
16. The management of the firm was continously complaining
that insuffioisnt work was being done, and civilian as
well as kapos drove the prisoners to work to exhaustion.
17.	Ill-treatments, punishments and ahootinp;: Prisoners were
frequently" beaten by We' kaoos""^^ the SS^m@n and it vxas
not unoo'.’sAon that the prisoners died as a result. The
prisoners were sometimes beaten on request of the civilian
staff. At least 5 prisoners were shot by tlxe 33, and those
shooting indi^dents are being dealt with in sepearate
cases.
18.	do thing: The clothing of the prisoners was .inadequate.
19. The attitude of the civilian staff towards the pri-
soners can be illustrated very plainly in tills connec-
tion. During the winter months 1944/45 the prisoners used
old cement bags, which they found in the yard, as a pro-
tection against the-cold. This practise .was stopped by
the civilian®, who under the pretext of requiring the
paper bags for salvage, approached the eaaxp commandant
to take-them away from the prisoners.
25. Clothes had to be worn for 8 months without washing,
as there was insufficient soap and water in the camp.
21.	Overcrowding and sanitary conditions: All the huts were
very overcrowded, particularly the sick-bay, where often
tw patients had to share one bed, and which, due to over-
crowding, could not accommodate all sick people.
«
22.	The fuel for the stoves in the Tiving huts had to be stolen
by the prisoners, and when they were caught by the civilian
workers the kapos had to beat then.
23.	The washing facilities in the camp were particularly bad.
They consisted of a well which had to be filled up with
a water cart, arid the water in well was polluted by the
dirt and urine from .the latrines which were only a few
yards awpy said which had sssilgc no draining arrangements
for the urine.
24.	Only in the last few months a water.pipe line was laid
into the camp.
25.	The latrines were filthy and unsanitary. The dead bodies
were thrown behind the urinal, and it was difficult to avoid
splashing them.
26.	The barracks, bedding etc. was infected with vermin.
27.	The care of tlx® sick vas supposed to be in the hands of
the late Dr. ZSC1IIRF3, the village doctor of SCHAbDELAH.
Tiiis doctor visited the sick-bay once a fortnight for

and medical supplies was very great.

for the prisoners, although the factory was a likely target
and was attacked.﻿
29. Welfai-e; There was no otmteen available for the prisoners,
but they were issued with some "Sauerkraut" and similar
food stuffs. About •g’ a dozen Red Cross parcels were distri-
buted amongst the patients of the sick-bay. Only the Danish
prisoners received Red Cross parcels regularly. Bit those
addressed to Danes, who had died or had departed were kept
by the SS for their own use,
pO. Evacuation; Although the 8S commander EBSETI wonted the i;ri-
soners to remain at SOHaHDELAH when the Allied troops approached,
the management of the firm did its utmost to have them eva-
cuated and their efforts were successful. Dr. GARUSEP the
manager of the firm, admits in his dipcsition that he did
his utmost to effect the evacuation. He denies that he was
the confidence ;.t n of the Party, but his signature appears
on a letter above the word "The Confidence man". Many pri-	,
soners lost their life during the evacuation to WQEBBELIIf, <u-—
after their ar ivnl there.

of Zone III of the Secret Belgian Army.	Cone III oovored the two provirees
oc£ Flan<fera.
I was arresto .1 by the Qeriians on 18 July 1944 an3 sent to (S'3123'JT Irison on
31 Augtet 1944. " I was loaded with other prisoners f an GHBRT Prison in a
train at JfSffiEP which brouf/ht us fotr days later to HAMB0HG-4®CTKIfGM.!ME,
I was there oxiy a few 'lays and,on t'ne Cth a' 9th of April 1945, was sent to
arm Tartar. tK-Riar iB .'ICK.	I was evacuated with all the other prisoners of
SCamriHLiH to UOBMLDI. 33» journey lasted six days. In this last oamp
of ¥0',iBSLlK we were :Creed by the Arnerican liriay on 2 'flay 1945.
At the caiip cf SCHAiCELAH about the beginning of January 145, the diet
consisted cf one-sixth of bread in the morning and one-fifth of bread in
the evening. At midday a basin of sotp theoretic ally thre n-garters of
a litre (= nearly l|- pints).made of beetroot, swede cr cabbage. Jxceptionrlly
a morsel of potato per basin of soup. In the evening, twice a week, half a
basin cf very liquid soup. After January 1345 and until the end cf my stay
at 3CIIAUIELA1I, tbs rations were gradually dtriinished, ending up with one-tenth
of bread in the morning and one-eighth of bread in the evening. Tho basin
of very 1 iquid soup at midday comprised only of swedes and water. During
the first period we received besides a little cube of margarine every day,
perhaps 10 to 15 granEB (- to ~ ounce); once a weeK a tablespoonful of jam,
a tablespoonful of meat paste or a tablespoonful of cheese. Curing the second
period these accessories were partially, then totally suppressed; besides one
receive^ in the morning and sawstimas in the evening a baa in of black coffee
substitute.
CLOTHING. We left H3JBTJGA13® dressed in a costume of striped cloth, beneath
which was a cotton shirt, generally in rags. Fcr certain of us a rag^sd pair
of cotton dravors. Sags fa’ the feet and- a shoe comprising^ a wooden sole _
with cloth uppers, T’-© shoes gave little more than a fortnight's wear and this
becann .*ao tie ally an outrage, giving no protection whatever against th? wet.
In February 194.5 a certain number of prisoners and finally at tte beginning
of Karch nearly all tbs prisoners received striped costumes of thicker material.
In March 1945 ve all received an overcoat; certain of the e overcoats were
auite warm for they came fro® c ivil ions made prisoner and despoiled of t!® ir
garments. ; most of these overcoats T^elonged to Hungarians acccrding to
docunsnts foxmd in the poefets.
Until, the ucKonfc we received overcoats, the temperature was very lav: November
Deserber, January. When a^werk we were expo .sod to the weather notably a
very piercing wind; most of^prIsoners also covered themselves with paper.
They- used old paper cement bags. These bags were of a thickness of 3 cr 4
layers of paper and were therefore very suitable for keeping warm.	Only
very exceptionally could aMrisoner procure a bag by theft, for tbs cement was
in a locked sled the keys of which were kept by a BAUMaI8TBR and of Which the
access was guarded during the day by a trusted Vorarbeiter.
Gererallj the prisoners received car procured themselves empty bags when they
were emptied of tteir contents near the cement-making machine. These empty
ba<^ were :lso the object of a trade and were bought from the Vararbe iter
for a cigarette. They were essebtial for alight protection against the odd,
/g/ The civilians knew﻿,' -,£i
- 2 -
The oiviliarE tosw about tha use of these cenant bags and in the course of
the winter tl®y (teHianded that the prisorers shoULd be forbidden to wear
paper on them.' The Kapos published these crders in the G amp as com mg
from Ccmandant	on the demand of the civilians. From that moment
about the end of December, anybody who was disoowred v.’ith paper bags on
him was punished with 25 strokes of a stick, which were administered in
public. But generally the Kapos were content, when they ware pressed by
oib of the civilian directors who mack a remark to them about it, to run
through the Camp, open tie workers* clothes, tear off the paper they had
on them, trample on them, tear them up and give tie delinquents a few
strokes of the "3cblag" (rubber whip). i yself haw been a victim of
this procedure. I insist on the fact that on several occasions I saw
civilians, especially PPSIFF3R, demand that the Rapes shouLd seise the
paper. It is to be re narked that these scenes of sed&ing paper ge nerally
took place on the days when the odd was teenest. 'The recovery of the ^
paper seized f”cm the prisoners had no advantaga for them since they left
the paper littering ths ground after it had been trampled on by the Kapos.
Naturally the prisoners employed all means of procuring a little warmth
for tte qdid was demoralising and terrorised them.
Ore of tie provisional shads serving as a at arenas covered with a tent.
This tent was frayed by tie weather. From it hung rags which the prlso-
asrs, eluding the" vigilance cf the Kapos, took. Some procured for them-
selves rags fcr tbs feet cr trouser straps, others were able to procure
pieces of cloth which they pirfc on their chests.
As soon as it was notice- that the prisoners were utilising these pieces
of cloth which had in fact become useless, the Commandant intervened and
required that all the bits of clothkhoufld be retimed; he had searches,
marie in the yard and punished with 25 strokes those who were found wearing
tte least bit of cloth from the,tent. Two Polish prisoners were beaten in
these oircunstances.
It is worth remarking, moreover, that when an order for a bodily search
asm out, its execution implied in general an hour of standing up in the
yard in the odd in complete na la dress, which was very harmful in the state
of health we- were in.
ACCOLuJDlATIDN.	Tire 800 workers and 100 sick men were quartered in four
shedsT One of them served as infirmary, the three others each comprised
230 to 350 imates according to the number of prisoners.
idea we arrived at tbs beginning of September, only two sheds had been
construited. We were quartered for 10 days on straw in one of them. .
Tl^ barrack roo^ns oomprised rows of three—tser bees with a central corrictcr
about l| metres wide and little side-cor riders 50 cm (=1*8") wide.
At ths front of the shed there was a room which served as dining room.
The dining room was exiguous. In general one was seated two to a seat.
The soup was distributed in china basins. Tie number of china basins
was insufficient, and sore a? us had to wait far the soup until the ot»s
had const*®d theirs. Decides, as there was no water supply until the
end of January, the china basins were for the most part washejfl superfi-
cially in tl* black coffee liquid. There was an insufficient number of
buslets to wash the china basins. Very often tl® soup was distributed
in umasbad basins to which adliered tl« dried remains cf the previous day’s
soup. This was evidently frem the hygienic poinjt of view a fearfiH oame
of infection.
The beds were supplied with a palliasse and two blankets. The lay-out of
these beds was the sub.iect of an extremely rigorous discipline. 3everal
timas a week there were punishments because tbs beds were not well made.

Tha hsating was done by stoves; two stoves pel* shed. T!» Oanpa«y reftsed
to simply the wood and coal fcr ieating. She I^apos encouraged the prisoners
to bring bask wood hidden under their jaotets or coal in small pieces.
Shen the civilians perceived that fusl was thus entering the Camp, they
protested vehemently and demanded sanctions. This was notably the case
with PFSJFFjSS. In gsnsral ths su^ly of coal was effectuated clandestinely
during the day thanks to the coming and going of certain prisoners who did
fatigues in the Camp.
SANITATION. Until January of* February the Camp had no water supply laid on,
although it went aj far as the GS shed some 25 metres away. During all this
period the only pr win ion of water was that to be found at the bottom of a
cenenfc well itself supplied by a water cart which the prisoners had to rep-
lenish. As in general all the prisoners were at work on the working sdedbc
site, it often happened that ths well repiainsd without water for several days.
Tbs water in this well became polluted very rapidly, ^^jrst because it was
not watertight and the mud of the yard, somettees 10 on'deep penatrate i to it,
then because ths whole space between tte v.’ell and the lair ire was seated with
wins.
During all this ported ths prisonsrs bould wash prily once a week, on Sunday?
afternoon. Tie re was for 800 or 800 men one cement trough about 6 metres
long in which were potrod 10 or 15 buctets of water. Om can imagine the
state of dirty®os of this water after tic washing of several doaen of
indtetetoals. it this maaent the Kgpos, on tie order of the S3, forced
everybody, under threat*of the 'acKLag" (rubber whip; to go and wash in
this filthy water.
At the .'hd of January or in FebrutsryXwater supply vnxi. at lasjs installed,
which enabled ua. to wash more conveniently. Practically all tlie prisoners
raraairnd without washing themselves fer about four months. Until January
we had only ore piece of soap between foil? men. There was one towel per 10
to 15 persons which it was necessary to pass on after tee. It was impos-
sible to wash cl otic s cr underclothes for lack of water. This pr ivileep was
reserved for Kapcs and Vcrar be iters alons.
Never was tte beddioig eliter wasted or disinfected.
Towards the end of the per led a laundry had been installed but it never
functioned la favoir of the prisoners.
The W.C. installations were most rudimentary, a wooden bar below which were
barrels. The installation seemed to be designed to give the maximua of
inconvenience to the unfortunate men who had to do ths cleaning.
At night, most of tte pr is o® r s^, s uiTer ing /.fr om bladder wakoess or dysenfe^
had to get up several ti®s to go to tte *¥10, Tte trip had to be made in
the mud and cold and was often very injur tern to health. Tte urinals had
no drainags and poired old: on to tte yard.
Tte corpses were usually exposed under tte ir inal in such a way that it was
difficult to avoid splashing them.
Until tte end of March there w^s no J.G.at tte sickbay. Tte worst oases,
most of them subject to dy&oui/yfy or intestinal typhus cr lung diseases %.er»
dblippd to go out, whatever their temper at ires, and cross tte yard to go to
tte W.c»
Tte sick bay was usually overcrcr/dted and it was necessary to have 2 cr 3
patients i:x3r bed. The diet was tte sane there as for tte healthy.
Theoretically there was for the serious oases a prescribed diet but this
disappeared for tte benefit of tte GS or tte Kapos. Never did a doctor
visit tte patients.
Tte sick bay was polished up when there was a visit fro® a HlSJENGAMMg S3
SS authority.
/V Ths medical orderly﻿LI-
— 2j. ■»
3?he loedical orderly was . fomor bricklayer arid received the assistance of a
Hungarian medical student, but .233SN, for^disciplinary reason, forbade the
latter access to the infirmary for three months. He was allowed to come
back again, in February, because of an increase in the number of patients and
-the alarming state from the sanitary point of view,
The corpses were dragged outside.and thrown beside the W.C. For some week
the Oorapany furnished a coffin for every two or three corpses, then it
alleged that the consumption of wood was too high and the corpses were buri
without coffins. On this subject it is worth observing that on the eve of
the evacuation of the SSOMNDELAH Carp the civilian authorities had the cros
removed aol the fields ploughed up over the graves, so as to remove the trac
of the charnel-house. A German village doctor came sometimes to see the
corpses and to count them.
Three times the sick bay was cleared of the worst cases and these went away
in convoys of lorries bound for NETENGAMMS, Hie fate of these prisoners
appears certain: they must have been erfcorrainated at HBIIEI'IGAMfcIS, for none
came back.
The number of patients sent to NSOEMS-AIME must have been between two and three
hundred. It was the Medical Orderly who designated the patients #10 were
to go to HEIENGAMME together with the Kapo HATJ3, who even chose among the
."healthy"prisoners a certain number of e hausted men ("Husselmans"), who were
also sent away.
Very rapidly -it became
extremely abundant. Hie Tapos amused themselves by forcing once or twice
a week, all the prisoners of a block to undress, to present themselves naked
before them to find out whether or not they had fleas. Even the most careful
prisoners were regularly infested with fleas. Insecticides or antiseptics
were never distributed, _
Never were the barracks disinfected near were the beds. The German civilians
had a particular fear of fleas.
In the laboratory where I worked for the last two mdnths of my detention,
anyone having fleas was threatened with immediate expulsiiom
THE IHFIHMAHT, disposed of very few medicaments. During the last three
months it was impossible, except by being a personal friend of the Medical
Orderly, to obtain an aspirin or a remedy against dysentery which raged
terribly.
To cure themselves from dysentery, the sufferers usually ate wood ash which
they found on the working site.
Exceptionally patients suffering from -Eyphus received an injection.
One of the most current diseases was a skin disease similar to abscesses or
boils. Disinfection was done with petrol or lubricating oil. The bandages
were of paper and consequently did not last half an hour's work.
The Medical Orderly on two or three occasions operated on patients himself
and practised amputations without anaesthetics. The sanitary condition was
on nhwwiftfift'iina'fcion both to the civilians and to the GomraaxKlant* but
LI was present by chance, and without having a right to be there,at a meeting
of Rapes'and Vorarbeiters, in the course of which EBSEtT mad© a speech to them.
The first problem he dealt with ms the bad sanitary state of the Camp which
was disturbing Hi® Conparys^ntfie insufficient number ^ of workers employed.
Hie Gamp Commandant attributed Hie bad sanitary condition to the fact that
the rsrisoners were eating raw beetroots which they stole in the fields near
the site. He attributed it equally to the fact that we were drinking water
which was unfit. The consequence was that those who took raw beetroots to
the camp were punished with 50 strokes of the stick, and even threatened with
hanging, and that it was forbidden to drink water from the tap which had just
been installed.
/V We received *﻿
%
- 5
We received on an average once a fortnight so called "Ksntiene Wahre0 (can-
teen goods): either salted cabbage or salted carrots, or salted fish roe.
She salt content of these products was very considerable, probably 60-80$.
Those who ate them were literally dying of thirst during the night and yet
they were impelled to eat them because of their hunger. On those nights
the Kapos mounted guard around the wells and later around the water tap to
prevent us from drinking. Arybody who attempted to go out to drink was
welcomed with "Schlag" blows.
In the course of the a/m meetings the Commandant gave an account of the
strong conplaints of the civilians whom he treated, however with sf certain
contempt- because the prisoner^jiere doixijj^Jjffip little work, and the output
was insufficient. He insisted! the Rapos^speed up the work by blows.
He said that the civilians demanded that the ¥brarbeiters arid Kapos should
note the number of those who worked insuff iciently and report them to him
and that the defaulters should be punished by deprivation of fdod for 24-
or 48 hours.
On the following day these measures were applied to 6 prisoners of whom
two were Belgians.
CQNPITIOWS GP WORK, In fact the Vorarbeiters and Kapos did not apply these
rigorous measures except when they were themselves under observation.
On several occasions civilians such as BSEIFMR, KRAUSS, KOCH, HBFESH, took
numbers of prisoners alleged to be too idle, and reported them to the
Arbeitsdienst Kapo^bo that the latter should take them before the Camp
Cormaarxlant. On more than one occasion the Arbeits&ienst Kapo conterSted
himself with giving a few blows to,the victim without taking more severe
disciplinary action.
Work began at dawn. We washed 1-| hrs before the beginning of work, and
there was usually 20 minutes to half an hour of roll-call before leaving
the Camp. The workers were divided into groups and worked in the pit, in
the construction of the/railway extension; others performed tasks as
bricklayers1 labourers, carpentersJ labourers, cement mixers, in short
all the tasks required for the construction of a factory.
Beginning with January one of the furnaces began functioning on an
experimental basis. From that moment, a group of 60 workers was detailed
for the working of the furnace. The work was supervised by Vcrarbe iters
and Kapos, but civilians who went round the site roused their seal, complai-
ning every time that there was insufficient activity.
It was because of this insufficiency of activity pointed out by the
civilians to EBSEN that the latter had the Camp patrolled by SS-aen armed
with a "Schlag", to supervise the work during the last two months.
The civilians were continually mingling with the workers, knew perfectly
the conditions of life, diet, hygiene, and saw the effects on the walking
corpses which we had become.
At the furnace, for example, the day shift which worked there for 12 hours
brought back every evening one or two comrades either on wheelbarrows or on
their backs as they were so ill. This procession passed in front of the
billets of the engineers directing the factory.
normally wofk ceased half an hour after sunset. A, day’s work was in effect
11 hours of continuous work with a break of one hour at midday. But folk
several weeks there was an additional task at night, digging shelters for
the S3. This night work lasted 2 hours.
When a prisoner collapsed at work during the day it was more often than not
forbidden to transport him to the infirmary. The civilians never struck
prisoners themselves but made the S3 or the Kapos intervene.

the salted and in general quite7 ineejib^ products of which I have spoken
above.
Only once did 12 Red Cross parcels arrive in the sick bay, which were
intended for the Belgians, but were divided among all the patients. On
the other hand there were at SCHAMSELAH for 3 months 70 Banes who benefited
from a favoured treatment and were well clothed by the Danish Red Cross.
l = a&.)
They received a two-kilo parcel every ten days. That gave them a pecu-
larly privileged position , for the cigarettes and the goods contained in
these parcels, not only gave them a substantial nourishment, but enabled
them to purchase the favour of the Rapes and indeed even of the civilians.
That, however did not stop some ten of the Danes from dying of diseases
in the camp. 7?hen the Banes left. Commandant EBSEN made them surrender
to him all the remaining parcels. These parcels were shared among the
Kapos and the SS-men.
Red Cross parcels intended for Banes, who had since died, fell into the'
hands of EBSEN, who kept and used them to the advantage of his favourites
or himself.
From the point of communicating ith the outside world, we were authorised
three times to write to our acquai$ances in Germany exclusively.
According to the account of a Frenchman employed in ESSEN*s office, these
let tears, when they did pot emanate from German prisoners, were tom up
either by ESSEN himself or a.t NSUENGAMME.
pAH'rtnTTT.AB OASIS OF ILL-TRE/vTi ENT. In the group which was working
outside on the construction of the railway extension, the Arbeits&ienst
Kapo used to kill individuals of whom he wished to rid himself. On three
different occasions three Letts were killed by rifle shots by ad 8S«*nan
who told them to perfoarm a task seme yards away from the group and took
advantage of it to shoot them.
Another strange process was- employed against those who presented themselves
late for roll-call on return from work to the sheds, whether it were at
midday or in the evening. Ibis delay which could be caused by the man
having fainted car merely fallen asleep in some hiding place, was consi-
dered as an attempt to escape. A Greek was thus literally torn to pieces
by dogs, and lived only 24 hours after this incident.
Two Boles who had hidden in a little shelter in February and had not
presented themselves in time for roll-call, were killed with revolver shots
there. The blood stains' could still be seen during the following day.
The corpses of these delinquents were exposed in front of the W.C* in such
a way as to show their wounds clearly.
A Lett -who had succeeded in escaping was hanged in NEI®1MMME. EBSSH
announced in front of all the men the punishment of the victim.
On the other hand a Belgian who had escaped was recaptured and sent to
a punishment camp. Be came back wearing the red txxxwgig circle of
those who tried t© escape, but later died a natural death.
What the civilians called ’’attempts at sabotage" was particularly severely
punished. A Frenchman from the neighbourhood of G85RARDMKR who had stolen
in complicity with a Kapo a piece of leather to make shoes was beaten till
he bled , by the Arbeitsdienst Kapo and the Lageraelteste in March 1945.
He was then for three days without food. HESTER told me personally that
he deserved to be hanged and that he -had hoped I had nothing to do with
this sabotage, because I should be hanged just thi same. This Frenchman
was saved, because a few days later the camp was evacuated. Threats fcae f
of hanging for sabotage were frequently made by the civilians; they made
quite a joke of it.
When I was working at breaking pieces act of shale and reducing them to
powder by means of a hammer, an engineer told me that if I gave a false
indication as to the numbers which the pieces bore, the penalty would be
hanging.	•	/?/ KKAUS took﻿- 7 -
KRAUS tooW'ie b of are EBSSN alleging that I had stolen an empty china ink
bottle ana derranded a punishment for sabotage. The incident led to nothing
because the bottle was found. This particular incidents merely indicates
that the civilians were particularly insistent on obtaining punishments in
these cases.
atr t?atti SHEKCERS. %ere were no air raid shelters for the prisoners. One
night when there was an alert all the lights illuminating the camps were
extinguished. In daytime, until February work was interrupted at the moment
of alerts j nearly ”11 the civilians left work and went to the shelter
provided for them. The prisoners would lie down in the place where they
happened to be. An attack took place on the factory by 3 fighters j 5 pnso-
ners were killed and 2 civilians wounded# Curious details .M^ter the raid
the SS-raen made the prisoners take stretchers to go and look for the wounded#
The civilians were carried on stretchers, whilst the wounded prisoners were
put on wheelbarrows, although there were empty stretchers by their side.
EVALUATION TO WGtBBELIN. On 8 April in the morning we learnt from the Kapos
■SSHfFomTKT^tatiah and the state of nerves which prevailed among the
civiliais that our liberation was possible. In the evening of the same day,
EBSEN informed us through the medium of the Kapos that we should be liberated
the following day, but that he intended to surrender the camp to the Allied
authorities,	departing himself with the SS-men and leaving us with
, the Kapos in charge. He insisted on this occasion that we should not attempt
to escape. In case of escape he threatened to put inti action the ack-ack
machine-guns placed around the camp and operated by civilians. In fact all
the civilians were engaged in anti-aircraft defence and the Home Guard.
For several weeks they had been trained in the handling of some 10 machine-
rs and little anti-aircraft guns placed around the camp.
the following morning we expected liberation. The ^pnace workers
returned to work whilst others remained in the c&rm. /$& the furnace, KOSSmN
the Kapo, hoping that we should not return to the camp, had decided to mate
only a pretence of continuing to work.	,
The nerves of the civilians were in a very bad state. It was at that moment
that Fraulein BAUMAN ' told me that we were going to be sent back to the North
because GAKLAPP had obtained a train to evacuate us. We were taken back to
the camp by the SS-men.
At midday one fifth of a loaf of bread and a few carrots were distributed.
This was the only food for the whole journey. We were loaded in trucks,
about 100 per truck, each of which was guarded by itaccgS. two SS-saen. Tne
journey lasted 4 days. Our only supplementary food consisted of-gth of a
loaf of bread and 2 or 3 carrots per day. The journey was particularly
tedious for the sick.	,. , „
At W03BELIN we were unloaded in the open, and then taken into a caEfi where
we were with others from NEUEKPGAMME, evacuated from ohe Nortr.
The end of/our stay at WOBBJ’UN was particularly murderous. One third of
our personnel have perished there.

of War Crimes Investigation Unit at STATMUKHLE on 18th June
I am 13roald .TAUCH, born on 23rd April 1902 at 3CHWSHHINGJ5N o/lleokar,
merchant by profession, of German naitonality.
I joined the NSDAP 1.2.1932. I was taken into the Allgemeine S3 in
Spring 1934.
On 15th November 1939 I was drafted to the Waffeen-38. On 20th April
1940 I was sent to RZ I'JBUENGAfM ; as a guard. There I was promoted Gber-
schar-fuehrer in the year 1943.
On the first of May 1944 I came to SCHAND-ILAff as a Eonssnandoleader. I
remained there till the end of July and then went to the BORGWART works
at BREMEN. From there I was sent to WEDEL in HOIoTEIN in October 1944,
where I was Rcsramandoleader. From 1st December 2$ I was Kommandoleader at
HiV; BTJRG-fiOTHSNBDRGSORT, where I remained to the end of the war.
When I cane to SCHANDMAH there were no prisoners there yet. They only
arrived 8 days later, and to start with on1y 5Gnern
When I arrived and inspected the 0 imp I found a half finished barrack to
accomodate prisoners, and one b/rrack which was in a soioewhat better state
and which was to accomodate the guards. At the end of May -a further 50
men arrived and in July the camp filled up to a capacity of 250 to 300 men.
They were mainly risonars of Russian and olisn nationality, also a few
French and Germans.
The prisoners were to be employed to work for 3TBIN0EI■ GMBH and to build
up the camp.
The working hours were from 7 to 12 and from 13.00 to 18.00 hrs. The firm
was urging the completion of the job. Occasionally we had complaints that
prisoners were lazy and did not work sufficiently. I explained time and
again that,as long as the food supplied by the firm SL'EHNOKL respectively
the entire diet was not improved, no better work could be expected from
the prisoners.
According to the contract the firm had to supply the diet of the com ando.
For this purpose the firm had made arrangements with a catering establish-
ment at SOHANDStAH. The food supplied was neither in quantity nor in
quality sufficient by any means for the heavy work. It did not come up to
the standards laid down by NrMfGAMMB. Furthermore the food was delivered
so irregularly that it was not possible to keep the lunch-time brake .BacAk.
I have often complained at the firm because of the food, I have especially
seen Mr. GORSBER and on one occasion rof. WITTIG. I made it clear that
if nothing was done about it I should see myself compelled to request a
withdrawal cf the prisoners. On this occasion I requested from Prof.WITTIG
that should install their own kitchen. This was done later and better
food could be prepared for the prisoners.
furthermore I have frequently complained about the lack of water. I discussed
the matter with Mr. GQR3LER and kr.frmo and I also had correspondence.
Up to the time I left there was however no% water laid on. The pipe line﻿is

Whilst I was Riximandoleader two prisoners escaped. One was a Russian
and the other a German professional criminal. In both cases I issued
orders for the man to be searchediand arrested.

June 1946.
I am Pierre Corse ills Theodore V3JMKGS!H, ‘born 3 August 1925 at MSKaBBKS,
law-student at the University of GHSME, of Belgian nationality.
During the war I worked in the ^elgian ^©sistarpe and Allied Intelligence
Service. In consequence of my activities I was arrested by the Gestapo
on 4 August 1944*
/»
On 5 September 1944 I was transferred to HSdHGAMMB where I was registered
under the number 44 862. After several days I was transferred with about
150 comrades to-the Commando of SCHAHTEkAH near BROTSWICK.
At S3HANlM.AIi there were with us about: 700 prisoners who were of the follo-
wing nationalities; Spanish, Prenoh, Belgian, Dutch, Otwraan, Italian, Gees3$
Russian, Polish, Lettish, Caeoh, Yougoslav and one Chine^se. Later there
arrived a contingent of Danes, who did not have the sane conditions as the
other prisoners.
The ^neral conditions of life seeaed to me very hard at tbs first contact.
This impression was only confirmed by later developments. Ou diet was as
fellowss In the morning a little coffee with a thin slice of bread; about
midday: a mess-tin of sot£, which was, six days out of seven, composed of
swedes and carrots. On Sundays few potatoes were to be found in it. In
tee evening there was normally a piece of ore ad and a little coffee. To thsfc
was added either a little piece cf sausags ae a spoonful of Jam, or else
a quarter of a litre(= half a pint) cf white soup.
When I arrived I was wearing ray KSlEIfGAMMS clothes, comprising: One shirt
one pair of dressers, one pair of trousers, one striped Jacket and a pair of
shoes. On the arrival of^firesh drafts of prisoners from H8KSNGAMME in
Hoveiteer we noticed that they were wearing winter garments, while we at
SCSiBIELAH were still wearing ous swsaer garments. Later we received a
striped cr cdoired oveicoat and a thicker garment, together with a pill-
over and a pair of shoes. Later we received a pair cf gloves. These
clearly inadequate garments gave us no protection whatever against the odd
which in midwinter reached twenty de#eee bale® sere ( = four degrees below
aero Fahrenheit). I personally cmld rover change W clothes between ray
arrival at SQFL4NDSLAH at the beginning of September 1944 and my liberation
at WGBWj&I on the 2 May 1945, One can understand the suffering which is
caused by wearing for si^it months the sane clothing without ever having the
possibility of washing them. We never received soap to enable ts to wash
our underclothes. I was very ill; numerous acres discharged from ny thigh
and my legs, an abundant and infectious stream of pus. My drawers were
impregnated with it. To my request to the KLeiderkammer (clothing store)
to change my clothes I received the answer: 'Tfeia, dubist ein dreckiger
&una".(‘No, you are a dirty dog). To that we must add that our garments were
alive with fleas.
When I arrived at SCIMBSLAH there was a great enclosure there fenced with
barbed wire of which a part in the interior of the eamp was electrified.
Nothing protected the prisoners against these electrified wires, tee passage
between Block III and these wires was so narrow that at each passage tee men
risked falling on teem, which happened more than once. One morning on going
out of ray hut I saw a body ^ the wires dead and quite blue.
The plan﻿~ 2 -
The xian wliich has haem shown to iae and marked "Exhibit Ho...." is that
of SGMTHSLM carrip. In September Block III did nob exist jret* it was
erjtected to aecoimaodate the Septeiriber draft, to which I belonged. On W
arrival the Block called. SEVIER contained different rooms, reserved to the
shoemaker's shop, clothing store, offices cf t5ie quartermaster and labotr
Kax>o« Sjere was also on entering it to the right the room of the priso-
ners in oharj^ of the cookhoise and 0amandofTia'er*s orderly; the left side
of this shed was occupied by the KaPO, Vcrarbelter and other notables of the
caof).
Block I was the dining room, cf the prisoners, with tie exception of two
rooms; the one on the left destined for the Co mandofliafer*s secretary, the
other cutting across the extreuB rear of the Block serving as infirmary.
JL
Blook II was the sleeping quarters for^the pr isorers. This block sheltered
about 500 men at the tin© of ay arrival. As to the ISO new men cf whoa I
was om, tliey war© billeted as well as possible in Block I from which the
benches and tables had been removed.	For two weeks on end we had to lie on
the .ground on a lit He straw, and for the first days without blankets.
The meals ’..ere served outside, whatever the weather. It was forbidden to
enter the barracks outside sleeping hours.
The reorganisation cf the camp took place after Block III was completed.
Block III was appreciably bigger than the other two blocks. The crganiza*
ticm cf the three blocks was as f. ollows: On the rjLAlL^Qn entering, a little
rooo reserved for t?© senior Inmate for the Bloch, £eF°the room and for the
Eapo. The first third was reserved for the dining room; the two other
thirds contained the usual three-tiered bunks, which were very tightly
packed. There was or© bed per man. Sach man had a palliasse and a blanket.
The prisoners had a ness-tin and a spoon, bub there ware not enougj mess
tins, and the last arrivals had to wait until the first had finished.
The '’Aborte" cr latrine was the most infected plaea in the camp. hiring
the first weeks of ny stay at oCHAHD Lilli it was impossible for kb to go
there to relieve nyself. I preferred to wait for working hairs. Here is
the description: A plain screen covered a deep hcle ten metres long)..a plain
plank running along the hole served as seat. The stench was insupportable,
in the winter the latrines were enclosed and barrels were placed in tbs ditch.
These barrels were always fill up and insifficjsnt for the nurher of priso-
ner s.
On ty arrival tliere was no water supply laid on, which mads washing oneself
practically impossible. It suffices to observe that on certain days we had
no water to drink in crier to understand otr distress. At the end cf Decem-
ber, however, we had running water fa the camp. Bub to wash without soap
in the state of deartiness® in which we were, was a Utopian fantasy.
In the course of Camber we received new ecnpanlons; fleas. As we had no
means of combating them, these ere at ires bred at a dizzy speed. In a few
weeks our bodies werebefag eaten awsy by hundreds of these animals: the
prisoners who had fleas were beaten by the Kapos, Being fa the infirmary,
I saw undressed fa front of re an I3alian who had under his arm and at the
bottom of his stomach real clusters of fleas which swarnsd on higw At night
it was often impossible far*rre to sleep on account of the exasperating presen®
of these creatures. I scratched Etyself so mush that m body will always
bear the traces of it.
When a prisoner was ill he presented himself fa the evening to the German
medical orderly St’ich 1WEP. She latter ruled as Grand Master over the fate
of the sick. This man, a i®r® bricklayer by trade, was head nurse and sole
dec ter of our comando. Admission to the infirmary was a difficult affair.
Thus I myself fa the course of Ifovember presented Byself eight days fa
succession to tlx medical orderly ite, and although tlx thernocater regis-
tered forty deppeos of ftever (=104 deg.F.) I was not admitted to the Kovier
block until I was half dead, and then only by cede? of a Kapo. I was suffe-
ring arm double pnemonia. I had to share the bed with another patient
suffering £r an disentery.	Srich MEP did all that was fa his paver to save
ny life although the indispensable medicaments were completely lacking.
Baring the fortnight fa which ny temperature fluctuated between 59 and 40 deg.

cr the crfchsr cachet of quinine and a few half aspirii©.. I stayed In the
%vder "block fraa the 20 Ifa-vember to the 50 I-Jarch. Diring this time I
saw the sick bay grow in disturbing proportions, fhus in the course cf
D^seriber, there was annexed to the sickbay a new department in the Sewier.
blookexclusively reserved for prisoners who, although not ill, coiJLd^o
longer stand on their legs owing to their extreme weakness. This deponent
of the weak became the mcst fc'portant in the inTirmary.	At certain periods
eash bed was occupied by two prisoi'»rs. At tii»s two or three msn died per
day in this roan alons which couELd ccertain at .the most 80 nen. They were
not truly sick Jsen; bub men totally warn out in consequence cf undernourish-
ment and over work.
I myself saw hundreds of operations of all kinds done by Skich HAPP with
groat dexterity, gentle mss and coolness. These operations were performed
with instruments aid medicaiaents which I would qualify as prehistoric,
A single bistoury which passed from wounds to wounds and from man to man,
without knowing any otter disinfectant tbfan the petrol stolen by prisoners
from the civilians. The gravest operations were performed without ana©site -
tising the patient for want cf the Essans to do so, I will cite the case
of a 'Jugoslav whose stomach HAPS* opened to exiract mere than a litse cf pusj
to stop this man tew. gesticulating HAH? had been forced to tie him down to
the operating table; in spite of this operation which had been very well
perftrued, tie man died during the following days.
dr. ZSCH3RH5 whoa I saw for the first time in the infirmary in December 1944
came about once a fortnight. Ib contented himself with making a rapid tour
of the infirmary which took hin 10 minutes. I never saw him treat a patient
or perform an operation.
I must mention that the bodies fron the infirmary were thrown ag^nst the farce
behind the "Abort" and that they were taken from the camp only once a week.
The sewage barrels rested on one sicte of the fence while the bodies were piled
up against the other, scarcely 20 centimetres (=8") away.
We rose every morning at 5 o’clock. After coffee work began. Except fer
the midday’ break uerk continued until nightfall. What I found most terrible
in my convict's life at 3GHAKDRLAH was the everyday work. Nobody can imagine
what it is to handle far ten or twelve hours on end, a shovel or a pick in an
ever gg'X&Jg state cf weakiBss. W© died 111® dogs from odd and hunger on
this wift§Fwcrkins site. To take a few minutes' rest was to catch a volley
cf blows. The work was perfarmed mainly in the open air in tte snow, inthe
jrain, in tte wind and in tte oddest frosts. It happened that we a odd not
iCdry for two or three days on end. At tte instigation of tte civilians direc-
ting tte work, the Eapos clubbed the prisoners.vigarously.to speed on tte
work* I can quote as examples the men named PFUFgS and HESTIS who required
that the Kapos and Varar be Iters shoiild beat the prisoners who did not work
hard enough. I can affirm that tte prisoners were beaten several tines a
day< not an hour passed without a man writhing under blows. Several died
inaediataly in consequence of tte blows received.
To protect ourselves a little against tte keen biting eold we had contrived
to cover ourselves with cement sacking and had even gone to tte length cf
employing a tent cloth which we cut up into pieces. Those who were found
in possession of a few square inches of this cloth were severely punished.
Tte only punishment that we knew was the MSchlags ". This is a whip cf thin
and flexible rubber which cannot break any boms but hurts very badly. All
•the S3 and tte Eapos possessed omt Punishments of 2S sir ekes vmre current
enough, and mainly applied by the Caramandafuhrer ESSEN. Tte Eapos and S3
beat men at rand ora when they were so disposed.
Tte canteen comprised "sweetmeats" such as beetroots, sauerkraut in vim gar,
tiny fish and sceetimes a little beer. These items cf food were distributed
to all those who were willing to eat them. The prisoners received no money.
A card gave then tte right to five cigarettes a week. I never received a Red
Gross parcel cr any letter. I was never able to write to Belgium.

for work. Our last meal w s at 38.00 hrs., this consisted
of 25u grs. bread, 10-15 grs. of margarine, and -alternatively
fisHpaste, beetroot and sausage. Soraet raes we got offal
(Freibank) tin meat. Thai was the reason that prisoners were

Kach risoner on admission into the camp was lssued with a
spoon, when this spoon broke o- got lost no second issue was
made. Consequently 30 men had to ahai'e 6 knives. A.I30 mesa-

erecting a synthetic oil plant. The work was very, ery hai-d
as no proper tools were issued. For instance 6 wen had to

# Dui-ing the'first 4 laonths there was no proper water supply, the
water ims fetohed in containers from . village. In the summer
we seaetiaes ha.d no water for washing nor drinking. A water
pipe was installed in September 1944-, after that the prisoners
had' opportunities for waa! ing ind drinking. Trie lavatory in the
camp consisted of 1.0 barrels which were dug into the ground und
only 10 men cerald use it a tito. These barrels smelled
terribly during the summer.
•JAtiGii
At the beginning when Oberaoharfuehrer held the post of comp
ccaamandant two of the above mentioned barrels nmre put into the
corridor, of 'the barrack, at this time the camp had only one
■barrack. In the evening all windows and doors were closed,and
the smell these two barrels caused sas unb sarsdile. In the morning
these two barrels were overt’loaded and the dirt all over the f1oor.
At the beginning there were no lice in t e camp but later m had
more lice than prisoners. H tldug wa.. done fra: the side of she
camp oomaandan' for del casing, we prisoners helped each other.
Once a month we were issued with a piece of 'fonseife ^iirsatzsoap),
this .ns not sufficient to clean the body th-'croughly once a
month.
There was no recreation in the camp, once a month we were 'allowed
to write a postcard. This privilege Russians and I’reuctoen did
not ©i 'oy.
On the 18th April 1^1-5 we left the SC dtDEIAH camp and we went to
SCMAhdKTAJt station. u w;re put on p5 truofcs which were ready
for us. Proa there we went via inf.liJp'jID...’, ..TjGJJMIBiB., dKBTOAL,
• VBTZimm to T4©WfiQSraap into tlie caa®- WOESB :• m. During the
,'journey prisoners who previ-.ulay wor ed in the kit chan >iad to
prepare the ieals for the od. On mo occasion x’rrar Kussiahs nd
two Frenchmen escaped from the trucks, 'than tills was noticed
Kom andofuehrer iSSFil and RlidCi :.1SL cane to ur . truck and wanted to
know how these prisoners escaped, ilobody of the present -prisoners
knew anytliing ab ut it and Untesrsoharfuelurer TRfSC 'SL tlireatened
us and said: "I will fetch a machine @on -nid sho ' every one of
you dogs*'. After this incident prisoners from this truck were
exchanged by prisoners from another truck. The true1: wit’1 the
sick prisoners smelleci tex1 ioly, some prisoners died through
lack of food and torment during the journey. The bodies were
buried on suitable occasions when the train stopped at isolated
places- This happened between ;.UID33HR'I and WIST;'i;. In the'
average 80 tisonera were put into ono tr-ok.
When we arrived at WQBHHBI3U we hud to stay for 4 days in the
trucks, then we were aecoaaodated in the camp v/hich was not
ca.a leted. The majority of the prisoners ha’ either blankets nor
feeding utensils. There were no beds, coase- uently many prisoners
had to lay on sand or cement floors. The first 3 days there was
no water in the camp at all, later a single hand pump was erected
for the whole camp. Tire feeding was very bad as no cook house was
established and only so much bread ava.>.l- ble as the camp of
dGSADDlSLA: has taken along for the evacuation. There was no
hos ital at all, only risoners wi:o came from other camps where
they were employed, as first-aid men or hospital Kapos, built a
barrack with ver. primitive, matex’ial which nerved as hospital.
Conditions in the can® - err. so bad that we had 600 dead in three
days. The 38 of aCHAIIDEIAH was sent from riQ!2?BET Til to 1®fENSAMMT.
On the 1st of May the vrtiole camp was put on trucks presuming that
'wo will be sent to MliaS'Anr in HOL.iTEIK- On the 2nd of ay we were
taken, hack to the camp and half an hour later an order came out
that all Kapos, Lagcraelleste and Blockaelteste had to eport at
the gate. There they were formed.up, among them were Russians,﻿Poles, Frenchmen a d Datchmen, •whereupon we left he prisoner
camp and were tranaferred to t e iS-camp* There ca. 1-50
prisoners were selected and armed "by the @S with carabines,
v/iiereupon. they were taken hack to the risoner camp in order to
relief the SS-guards which later escaped with us. We were
freed in the village of* W0SKB.Cr>JN«
I have seen he following incident in dGEA..DSLAH: One day in
summer ISMv a BVrachmcn informed the lagerkomsandant jKUSCHSL
that a Russian wiaoafe orison number was 4114^ manul'acturcsd
daggers. In the evening TRUoOHEL fstd.ed the Russians and took
him outside tlie camp. vVe heard @ shot 10 minutes later and
still a little later Kapo 1111311.1® and a foreman brought the
Russian dead into the camp.
On a certaiftaln autumn 1944 TRUSGHSL lost his pistol. _ He attid
that the one who finds his pistol will he given 100 cigarettes
and special good food. A Latvian policeman who also was a
prisoner accepted the offer. For a fortnight ho ecoiVed good
food and cigarettes, hut did not return the pistol. After the
fortnight elap sed ffR'.'3CH5'lL gave dr another 21 h hours, hut he
still did not bring the pistol. HSUSCHEL said that he knew
wliat to expect in case he did not bring die pistol hade by to-
morrow night * Thoreaipon he was sent the next <diy to the railway
oesaaando. T}iis comnando was supervised by 6 S~i-fflen,to one of
the 33-men TRUSCItSL gave the order not to bring the Latvian back
alilfe. The same evening the Latvian was brought back. I have
seen the ahotwound in his chest myself.
One day in autumn 191(4 the S3-man KERNINGS caught a Russian steeling
the peelings of a weeds. 33-man HKHNINGS iramedi -tely began to beat
the Russian with his hands and kick with his feet- Then he found
a atick and beat him with it. Tte was bleeding from his face, I
havSstho Russian a few days later his body mis badly bruised.
About August 1944 a risoner of erman nationality escaped. A
search on which S3 and -risoners had to take part commenced
immediately. After the search was over everybody returned with
the exception of the S3-aaan HAKE. Much later HBHK returned and
said! "I have recaptured him and I shot him right away1'. Thereupon
HAIM took two prisoners in order to fetch the body. On the way
he told them the whole story how he shot the nr sbner. He first
wounded ham, tliis nrisoner begged HAIM to leave hi. aliJfe, but
hash shot him cold blooded. Inter the body was brought into the
camp and placed on the breadbox, and the risoners were nia&e to
walk in a circle round the body. This was made in order to set
an example in esaso another one of us would, escape. The body had
two shotwounds, one in the lower- back and the otaer bne in tue chest
Rottenfuahrer Paul SCHfflAv/A was one of the most brutal among the
young 33-iiien. It was great fun for Mm to set his dog on the
prisoners without the slighest reasons. -Easy prisoners Mid their
pastern joints bitten by tn dogs.
It was either September or October 1944 when a Russian prisoner
escaped. He was given away by people in the village. 3CIMJAWA
and another S3- man went down by a car which I was driving into
the village in order to fetch the escaped prisoner- The hands of
the Russian wore tied to his back, he wo ' put on. a lorry which in
the meantime also arrived. The lorry and the car went back to the
camp. Arriving in the camp the Russian was kicked from the lorry
and fell sidwa/s to the gr und. SOHEKAfA and the other 33-man﻿﻿PRsDuctida/ M?. 2 //

Monat bekamen wir ©in Stueck Tonseife, das war nicht aus-
reichend im Monat einmal den Koerper gruendlich zu wascben.
Im Lager gab es keinerlei Unterhaltung , einmal im Monat
durften wir eine Postkarts schreiben. Diese Verguetigung
wurde von Russen und Francosen niebt genossen.
Am 18 April 1945 verliessen wir das Lager SGHAHDELAH und
bsgaben uns nacb dem Babnbof SC HANDEL AH. Dort waren 35
Waggons bereitgestellt auf welebe wir verladen wurden. Von
da auo ging es ueber Heilmstedt, Magdeburg, Stendpl, Witten-
berg© aacb Ludwigslust. in das Lager WGIBBSLIH. Waebrend
des Trans-portes mussten Haeftlinge welche f rue her in der 3ECMS
Kueebe taetig waren fuer die SS die Vsrpflegung beriiten.
Bei einer §elegenbeit sind 4 lussen und 2 Frm sosen aus dom

Magdeburg and Wittenberg©. Im Durchschnitt befanden sieh
80 Ha ©filing© in einem Waggon.
In woebbelin angefcoomen musstan wir 4 Tag© noch in den Waggons
verbleiben, dann erst warden wir in das kager welches noch
niclit vollstaendig errichtet war untergebracht. Der groesste
,*'eil der Haeftlinge besass weder Deeken noeh Issgeschirr. Is
waren keine -^etten vlrhanden, sodass mancher “acfiling aaf
blankera Sand Oder Zemntboden liegen wiasste. Die ereten 5 fage
gab es im bager ueberhaapt kein Passer, srpaeter ward© faer
das gesamte Dagereine einsige Handpumpe errichtet. Die Ver-
pflegang war sehr schlecht, zuipal die Kueehe erst eingerichtet
warden musste und Brot nur soviel vorhanden war, was das
"ager von SC HANDEL AH ait aur Evakuisrung mitgenoimaen hatte.
Ein Revier gab es ueberhaupt nicht, sondern die Haeftlinge
welche von anderen Laegern gekoramen waren und als Haef tlings-
aersto Pfleger, Oder Revierkapos taetig waren, haben aus den
primitivsten Q-egenstaenden eine Ea^acke als Revier aufgebaut.
Die Sustaende"im Lager waren so schleeht, dass in S xagen
600 Tote za verseichnen warenjrDie SS von SGHANDELAH warde
vbn woebbelin nach Neuengaiame verschicht.
Am 1. Mai WUrden wlr das gesamte Lager verladen mit der
Vermutung uns nach Neustadt in Holstein verladen zu warden.
Am 2. Mai warden wir morgens in das Eager mrueckgebraeht
und eine halbe Stunde spaeter ksra ein Befehl, dass alle Kapos
sowie Eggeraelteste und BlockaeJteste sieh beim Tor u
melden haben. Dort warden sie zusammengestellt wobei sich
auch Russen, Polen , Pranzosen and Hollaender daminterbegaben,
worauf wir das SI0C21X Haeftlingslager verliessen um nach dem
SS Lager gebraeht zu v®rden. Dort warden von ea. 150 Haeftlin-
gen 25 ausgesucht und von der SS mit einem Karabiner ausge-
ruestet* worauf sie zurueck nach dem daeftlingslager gebracht
warden um dort die SS Posten abzuloesen welche dann ait uns
auf Flucht gingeni Im Dorfe WOEBBELIN erhielten wir unsere
Preiheit*
Ich habe den folgenden Zwischenfall in SCHANDSLAH gesehen;
An einem Tage im Sommer 1944 ein Prgfosose Informiurte den
Lagerkommandant TRUSCHEL, dass ein Russe dessen Haeftlings-
nurnmer 41148 war, Dolche anfertigte. Am Abend, holte TRUSCHEL
den Russen und nahm ihn ausserhalb des Lagers. Hr hoerten m
10 Minuten spaeter einen Schuss und noch etwss spaeter brachte
Kapo Mueller und ein Vorarbeiter den Ruseen in das Eager tot
hinein.
Im Herbst 1944 an einem bestimmten '^age verlor TRUKHEL
seine Pistole. Er sagte, dass er demjenigen der die Pistole
wiederfindet 100 Zigaretten und exrtris gates Essen geben
wird. Ein Lettischer Polizlst, der auch faeftling war, nairni
das Angebot an. Fuer 14 Tage bakam er gut zu essen und Ziga-
retten, brachte aber die Pistole nicht zurueck. Nachdem die
14 xage verstrichen v/aren, gab TRUSCHEL ihm noch eine Prist
von B4 ’Mgxeuz Stunden, aber auch dann brachte er nicht die
Pistole. Daraufhln sagte TSUSCHCL, dass er wuesste was ihm
bluehe im^alle er die Pistole bis morgen abend nicht bringt.
Daraufhin ¥mrde re den naechsten Tag in das Stastsbahnen

Deposition on oath of Albert Conrad GOBBLER, male, of
Masehstrasse 33 > BRAOKSOHSfEIG, sworn before S/Sgb, Frank
Peter GOLDING, 8th King's Royal Hussars, of War Crimes
Investigation Unit BAOR at BRTOWIOK on 4th July 1946.
I am Albert Conrad GOBBLER, born on the 3xd July 1882
at SAI&GXTTER, merchant, of German nationality.
I was a merchant before the outbreak of war and during
*	the war,till Ootober 1943 1 was employed at the labour
exchange. In April 1944 1 was given a job by Berm OHLEN
at the StEIHQEL GmbH. At the beginning 1 did clerical work,
later on I was departmental chief of the department for
planned economy, and I was in charge of the redistribution
of urgent requirements to the purchasing department aS BABAS.
the STEIMEL GmbH was foundedfor the purpose of producing oil
from lamina. As far as X know, part of the necessary labour
were procured by Prof. WITTIG and Herrn OHLEN from the NEOEft-
GAMME Concentration Camp. 1 know that Prof. WITTIG and
Herr OHLEN have repeatedly been at NEUENGAMME. One day,
approximately at the beginning of April, and only two days
before the arrival of the first prisoners, I was informed
by either Prof. WITTIG or Berm OHLEN that prisoners are
going to arrive. We were to care for them and I was to ar-
range the feeding of the prisoners. I carried out the catering
in accordance with the offioial regulations of the Wirtsohafts-
amt.

.feed
As it was not quite understood, what our responsibilities in
connection with ears of tire prisoners were, I held a meeting
with the SB from NMXENGAMME during the beginning of May 1944.
A confirmation about the agreements was given by the leiter
of the Administration of MUENGAMME Concentration Camp in let-
ter Ref. No. 1 ij/7/5.44/Wb/kr. dated 16th May 1944. I was shewn
a copy of this letter to-day, whieh^ has been initialcd-fayItt
m and is correct.

~~<s
The medical care of the prisoners was the responsibility of
the firm, namely of Dr. ZSCKTSIS. The oalling in of Dr. SSCffljRPE
was the responsibility of the Lagerfuehrer.
The feeding of the prisoners was our responsibility till the
21st May 1944» Than the, S3 took over from us.
The firm was responsible for the housing of the prisoners.
The building of barracks was the responsibility of the tech-
nical leader. Tin November 1944 Anton KOOH was technical
leader. The decision whether more barracks were to be built
was in the hands of the Direktlon.
The supply of water met with difficulties. At the beginning
the water had to be brought from SOHANDELAH, a distance of
4 kilometres, in barrels. Later on a water installation was
laid, but it was only in autumn or winter that the installa -
tion was laid into the camp.﻿As far as I knew the living quarters were never desinfected.
$hs airangemsnts for the living quarter® and. the sick-bay
mre made by the STSIM)EL GmbH, I procured as much coal for
the camp as I was allowed to by the Wirtsohaftsamt. The Wirt-
schaftsamt very often rejected my indents because of shortage
of ooal.
We were responsible for the cleaning and delousing of clothing
belonging to prisoners and of the camp laundry, but only from
the financial point of view* The camp leader had to see to tee
actual working arrangements, and we only covered the expenses*
Asfhr as I know bills were promptly paid by the STEINOEL GmbH.
This applies to bills for medical supplies too.
Prof. WITTIG was the general dinreetor of the Concern and gene-
ral manager of the STEINOEL GmbH and as such responsible for
the administration of the fim. His deputy was Herr Detlev OHLEN.
The technical department was responsible for the distribution
of work, ©specially for the Branch of woife and the length of work-
ing hours* The technical department had to decide whether work
should be carried on during bad weather, v’iork was done under all
weather conditions* Prof. WITTICr fixed tht time for certain jobs.
These times had to be adhered to, even so the time given was
sometimes very short.
Shortly before the arrival of the .Americans we were called to-
gether by the Betriebsleiter Dr. GASLEEP. He explained to us,
that he had done his utmost to take away the prisoners. It seems
that they are to remain in the camp and the fim is to be closed
down* % advised us to go home. Even So the prisoners were de-
ported.
Ab far as I have heard the prisoners in the SCR&I5DELAH camp
were of different nationalities, including Dutchmen, Danes,
Frenchmen, poles and Russians.

fuehrer Karl TRUSCHEL Wachtruppfuehrer, d.h. er hatte
die SS-Truppe, die das Lager bewachte, unter sich.
Der brutalste SS-Mann des Lagers war TRUSCHEL. Schon
morgens beim Ausruecken fing er an, die Haeftlinge
zu schlagen, wenn sie nicht in strammer Haltung an
ihm vorueberzogen. Seine Spezialitaet war, waehrend
derArbeitszeit durch das Baugelaende zu streifen, um
dann Haeftlinge, die sich nicht voll und ganz ihrer
Arbit widmeten, zur Sestrafung heranzuziehen.
Zwei Maelie sind mir noch gut in der Erinnerung, bei
denen er den Tot eines lettischen Russen sowie eines
Letten herbeifuehrte.
Der lettische Russe hatte den Vornamen Richard ’and
die Haeftlingsnummer 41148. Im Somiier 1944 beschul-
digte ein franzoesischer Haeftling den Haeftling
Richard, dass er Stilets anfertige und teilte dies
TRUSCHEL mit. Daraufhin wurde eine Untersuchung einge-
leitet und man verlangte von dieseiH Richard, die Sti-
lets herbeizuschaffen. An eines] Abend, als das ge-
samte Kommando wieder im Lager war, wurde dieser Richard
von Unterscharfuehrer TRUSCHEL aus dem Lag r herausge-
holt. Ich konnte vom Lager aus sehen, wie der Russe
in der Riehtung des Arbeitsplatzes weggefuehrt wurde.
10 Minuten. nachdem die beiden das Lager vcrlassen
batten, ertoente ein Schuss. Ich konnte nicht genau
sehen, was geschehen war, weil die beiden zu welt ent-
fernt vom Lager sich befanden. TRUSCHEL kam
daraufhin zurueck und gab zwei Haeftlingen, Ernst
MUELLER, und einem anderen, den Befell, mit ihm die
Leiche ins Lager zu holen. An demselben Abend sah ich
mir die Leiche, die im Lager aufgebahrt war, an und
konnte einen Herzschuss xeststellen. -Der offizielle
Rapport von TRUSCHEL nach BSUEHGAvL.iE lautetes "Auf
(ier^Flucht erschossen".﻿7°
In dem zweiten Fall war das Opfer ein lettischer
Polizeibea. ter. TRUSCHEL verier seine Pistole auf
den Arbeitsplatz und setzte eine Praemie von Zlga-
i e -ten frier denjeni^en a us t cler ihm die Pistole
wieder besciaffen koenne. Der lettische Pollzei-
beante erklaerte TRUSCtiEL, dass er die Pistole
wieder herbeischaffen koenne. Daraufhin bekam er
von TRtSCHEL und EBSEH Zigaretten and Brot als An-
zahlung. Each etwa 14 Tagen bis drei Wochen. als
der^ lettische Polizeibeaicte die Pistole im..er noch
nioht nerbeischaffen konntej wurde es deii beiden zu.

dem Arbeitskonmando’ Staatsbahn zugeteilt. Der
Posten dieses Arbeitskomaandos arhielt den Befehl
von TRUSCHEL, dass der lettische Polizeibeamte am* •

Befell wurde von dem Posten ausgefuehrt, iinj als ich
am Abend die Leiche sah, konnte ich an der leiren

Wednesday the loth of April'1946•
I am HEE A5f Christian Friedrich STRUCK, bom lo.3«19o6 at
HlEE'rZ/llolstein, roadworker, Gerraan nationality.
I was ai-rested’on the 22.9.194o in TELTOW near Berlin for
continuation of my illegal activity in the Communist Party
of Germany. I.was sentenced ta t .o yearns and 9 months hard
labour for treason. These I spent at IUCKAU. I ms discharged
in June 1937 and * landed over to the Gestapo who transferred me
at once to the Concentration Camp SACHS®? AITSEM. There I stayed
until 194o. I was transferred on the 1st of March 194o to
the Concentration Camp IMJJhGAMKE. Together with ano her prisoner
Fwas moved to SCHffiDELAH to start a kite >en there. I was in
charg ; of e prison-kitchen until I fe 1 sick with / ua -atyphus
in September and after that I ms employed in the civilian-kitchen.
Although I was at most times inside the kitchen and for this reason
did not see much of wtqic Happened outside, I did see that Untersc ar-
fuehrer TRUSCIiEL beat prisoners of Polish and Russians nationality
on a several occasions. He was esracially known to order tl e SS-gtiards
to chase and drive the prisoners •fl£b work hard. He was a most dangerous
superior. During the evacuation from SCHAkDELAH a few priscfiiiers escaped
from a box-waggon. After this had been noticed TR CISC.-EL said:'' I saALl
have everyone in this waggon shot." He could not oari’y out this t'nreat
because he was not the commandant.-
I remember that TRUgCrEL en'ered the dining-room during January and
found a few prisoners tl ere and set about chasing them out ox tne room.
Of t uese he hit a Pole in a most brutal manner in the face and ricked
Mm in the' back so that he fell through the door and remained lying out-
side.
I also remember that TRUSOHEL surprised a group of Russians and Poles
who had taken shelter in a shad. He beat tnese in a brutal way,
using a stick and chased them out.

June, 1946.
I am Emile LOVEEYISTH, born at Serchovo (Czechoslo-
vakia), on the 14th July, 1920, tailor, of Czechoslovak
nationality.
I was a member of tne Belgian Army of the Resistance
Movement and was arrested by the Gestapo on the 12th
April, 1944 at Brussels. Iter a period in St. Gilles
Prison until the end of August 1 was transferred to
Neuengamme Camp where I arrived about the 1st(September
and after a week I was sent to the Commando ©r SCHAK -
BELAH.
There were about 800 prisoners of different nation-
alities, Poles, Russians, Letts, French, Germans, Danes,
Belgians, and oche ra.
TRUSGHEL was the Assistant Commandant; he was a
very brutal man. One afternoon after the camp had
been machine-gunned by tne English (English -ircraft),
certain prisoners took advantage of the alert while
there was no supervision, to rush 00 tne carrot and
beetroot store to steal some. The store door was shut
out there were a few of those vegetables which lay be -
neath the openings of the door ana they stole them. At
that tise moment the prisoners were surprised by TSUSCHEL
and one of the EUMDE FJHRER. They caught tne prisoners
who were ste ling and began to beat them, especially a
Pole, a Belgian and a Frenchman. The Pole fell to the
ground witn his fac# bleeding. I noticed that they beat
him in a very atrocious manner. This Pole who had re -
ceived kicks' from TRUSCH3L and rifle blows from the
HUHDEFUHRER was taken in the evening to the infirmary
where he remained for several weeks.
I have made this deposition in the French language
which I understand perfectly.

I, Karl I'RUaCBLL, was warned that I was not compelled to mice a
statement, if I did not wish to do so. All a^r statements will be
taken down in writing and can be used in future as evidence.
I make this statement voluntarily and not under pressure or
promises of remuneration.
I am Karl fROSCHEL, bom S. 10.1894 in SCHAAKM Krais KoenigsKerg,
tailor and merchant, of German nationality.
I was conscripted on the 26.2.1942 at	where I held the
rank of Unterscharfferer, as I had been previously an Unteroffizier
in the Wehrmacht. I was detailed for the 3rd Company and later
became the Duty-Feidwebel of this Company. In October 1943 I ms
transferred to BKdiEN FABGE where I was working as Spiess. In July
1944 I was transferred to SOHAHDSLAH. There I commanded the guards.
The Aussenkcmmando SCHAHBBLAH consisted of appr. 100 prisoners when
I arrived there and later on it reached the total of 700 men. The
prisoners were Russians, Poles, Frenchmen, Dutch, Belgians, and
other nationality at.
The prisoner’s health ms bad. Many pr is carers were allready sick
when they came from KEUUKJAMlE. In SCHANDELAi a number of prisoners
died. I do not know how many. As far as I know the causes of the
deaths were phlegponia, inflammation of the lungs, and several were
shot whilst escaping.
ly duties consisted in detailing the guards for their various duties
and J. also had to look after the guards; companies.
One day in Autism I lost sy pistol when I was looking for an escaped pris-
oner. Although I searched I, did not find the pistol. I reported this
to the camp senior HANS and asked him to return the pistol when it would
be found. The pistol was never found.
I personally have never shot anybody. But have beaten prisoners from time
to time because they were thieving from their comrades. The prisoners
were punished for smaller offences by the Kommandofuehrer EB3EN. The
punishments consisted of the withholding of cigarettes or money or blows
with a stick.

At fee time of nsy a rival the Aussenkommando SCHiJJDSLAH consisted

prisoners died at SCli&i?IlHLAH* 1 do not know how many. As far
as I know death was caused by dropsy, pneumonia and some were
. shot whilst trying to escape.
My work consisted of the allocation of duties to the guards and
looking after their welfare.
One night during the Au£unfc or winter of 1944 I was called to
2B8EH*. He exclaimed to me feat acme of the prisoners had made
daggers and that a whole parcel of them was still hidden, by one
of the risoners. He ordered me to go withfels -prisoner to fetch
the hidden daggers. I took the prisoner and left the camp with
him. It as about 7.0© o'clock pmassamkt in the evening and
already very dark. ;/e went in the direction of the fumatfiaes.
The prisoner run away from ms, and I shouted to him time and
again that he should stop and show me where the daggers were.
H ov/ever, he did not stop and I pursued him all over the working
site. Finally I saw him behind the last cover. I shouted to him
to stop but he kept on running. I lifted my rifle aimed as roll
as that was possible in the dark and fired. The prisoner was
about 25 metres away. He fell immediately. I went over to Ida
and saw him lying there. He was dead. I returned to the camp and
reported to 3388® that I had shot the prisoner whilst trying to
esca >e.
One day in autumn I lost my pistol whilst sea ching for an escaped
prisoner on the working site. Despite of my search I did not find
the pistol. I told the Lageraelteste Hans about it and requested
him to return the pistol if it should e found, A Latvian came

In my Deposition of 9th April I said that the Hundefuehrer
Karl HEINZ had shot two Russians. Now I remember th t I
have made a mistake with the names. The Hundefuehrer who
had sloot the two Russians was called ITEIZ. The incident
oecured as follows:
One evening at the beginning of March 1945, two prisoners
were absent at roll -oall. because of this th© g ards
and the foremen had to scour the surrounding district*
I was to ether with the -Widefuehrer HEIZ and 3PD RAD
who was a foreman. It was already dark and we entered
a hut. The dog barked and we found a prisoner. We dragged
the prisoner out of tha comer when a shot was suddenly
fifed. HEIZ had shot the prisoner in the chest and the
prisoner died instantly. SPIMRAD ‘eft the hut to report
tMs to the Kommandofuehrer. I followed on behind and
bad advanced barely 20 paces when a second allot was fired.
HSIZ had also found the second, prisoner ahd had shot him
through the head. I have inspected both corpses together

I m Johann HBIE, born 18 October 1925 at MODOSGH, Serbia, farmer by
occupation and of Serbian Nationality. I make this declaration in German
which language I perfectly understand.
I was called up in March 1945 to the infantry. I was detailed to fee
training company at N&JENGAMMD. In fee autumn 1943 I was made dog-leader
and was issued with a big black Rotweiler dog. I remained in NE5JENGAMME
u-itilz September 1944, when I went to SCHA.NDSLAH, where I was dog-leader.
At fee end of February or the beginning cf March 1945, two internees were
missing at the parade. Hans SpiMJARD, Arthvr GHDSSg and myself went out
to find the internees. It was about 2U)0 hrs. First tie Kapos found
one of fee internees in a hut. Mans SPINNARD shouted: "Here he is ", and
I fired a shot wife ray rifle towards the prisoner, who was about 8 metres
away. Hie internee fell dewn.	SPINIERD said: Hie is dead". We then
went out and smoked a cigarrette. Then GROSS! said: 'Let us see whether
m can find the otters". GROSS! went back to the kasaae: hufc and called
out suddenly: "Here he is". I could not see tte interne®, and I therefore
climbed tip fee door.	From there I coiXLd see him clearly. The internee
was about 4|- metres away. I aimed at his back and fired one shot.
Thereupon I left the hufc,
I went to Latcerfuhrer EBSEN and reported to him that w© had found tte
internees and that I had shot fees both.
In the Autuan 1944, Unterscharfferer 3RUSCHEL said to me: "This internee
must disappear.". He showed to me a Lit uanian prisoner. I refused at
first, but Unterscharfuhrer TKtJSCHEL threatened me: "This means refusing
an order" and said te would report us. I tdd him that 1 had to obey,
but should cpaplain about it. I went with the Commando to the railway
building. There, at 10.00 hrs I shot fee internee in the back with ay
rifle.from about 70 metres. He was not dead after the first shot, and
I fired again at his back. He was then dead.

Prlson,UIi'fcil the end of August I was deported
to the camp ox Neuengsmme, where I arrived about the

There were about 800 prisoners of different na-
txonalities, Poles, Russians, Letts, French, Germans,
Lanes, Belgians, and others.
HAMMs one morning in the winter of 1945 the S3
HAMH beat a prisoner, I think he was a Frenchman or
a Belgian, with his rifle until the man fell in a
^tinned to beat him brutally when he
had fallen to the ground; he received blows on the
back, the head and everywhere. Other prisoners as
well as myself were looking at this scene and HAMM
ordered us to go away. Wq went behind the hut where
we could no longer see what was happening.
0n® winter evening we were working on the night
shxft, at uhe furnace. If we were cold we were al -
lowed to warm ourselves a little (authority given by
Capo Herbert X03SMAN). Suddenly HAMM appealed and''
began to beat us; v;e ran away but he was able to
catch a Bexgian named LEBLANC, Felix, from the region
. „?orin®Se *	116 kicked him and struck him v?ith his
rifle wherever he could reach him. After that the
Belgian could work no more, and I saw that he had
many blue weals.
HAMM was always striking the prisoners, either
with his rifle, or else by kicking.

onl6th June 1946.
I am Jakob HAMM, bom on 4.12.21 at SP.AHDRBS in ROMANIA, bricklayer by
trade, of Roumanian nationality.	*	«
From March 1942 till June 1943 I served in the Roumanian Army. I was then
transferred to the Waffen-*S3 and sent to K0EIHG3BERG4. In July I was sent
to HAJ.,IBURG-NHUSNGA/nvIS on guard duty. In October 1943 I came to WITTENBERG
where I did guards. In April 1944 I returned for a fortnight to NEUMGAMME.
Together with a transport of prisoners I was sent to the outlying commando
of SCHANDELAH.
In SCHANQEIAH I was a guard.
In Summer 1944 a prisoner escaped. The commando leader JAUCH gave orders
to all 33-men to search for the man and to shoot him. I started on my
way towards IMRE. About 4 l/2 km from the camp a Landesschuetze waved
to me. He told me here is a man from the penitentiary. I asked him where,
and at the same moment a shot rang. I went through the r^je-field and
^.foimd the prisoner who had already been Kzrnndsd hit by a shot. SkiaS
When I came up to the prisoner he jumped up and ran away. An TJnteroffizier
of the Landesschuetzen was there as well and had fired the first shot.
I told this Unteroffizier that $e had to bring the man back to the camp and
thereupon he shot once more at the fleeing prisoner. He was using a
cardbine. I too had a carabine which was not loaded though. After the
second shot the prisoner was dead. I did not know his nationa1ity, 1 did
not know the Unteroffizier, he could have come from a camp in the woods or
the amunition factory. ■ He was a small stqut man.
I rang up the camp then and asked the ccmmandofuehrer to collect the dead
prisoner. Two S3 guards and four prisoners arrived then, the names of the
33 guards were MALLOK and STUMP?,	returned to camp.
I also know that the guard with a dog, Hans HSIZ, shot two prisoners who
had beenfound by his dog. The nationality of these prisoners is unknown
to me.
I have made this deposition in German which language I fully understand.

of War Crimes Investigation Unit at Brussels on the
27th June 19^6;
I am Hubert Leon CLAUDE, born on Che 8th August
1913at Ghent, representative of the Liebig firm, of
Belgian nationality;
I was arrested by the G.F.P. in July 1944 at
Ghent for broadcasting from a secret wmeless sta-
tion. After spending 1 1/2 monrhs in Ghent Prison,
I was sent to Neuengamme concentration camp whence
after 0 stay of about ten day* I was sent to LCHAN-
D3LAH near BRUNSWICK; (about the 15th September
1944);
At Schandelah I saw a number of Capos and SS
men treat prisoners brutally.
SPINNRATH:	lager chief. He war the most cyni-
cal and terrible man whom I met during my detention.
I have seen him strike and kill so many times that
it-is impossible for me to specify the number. I
cite a few cases; one day, in February, a French-
man who had fainted from exhaustion on the road
was struck by Spinnrath; he kicked him in the sto-
mach and on the head. An hour afterwards, when
the victim was picked up, it was noticed that he
was dead.- He was then taken near the other bodies.
Somewhere about the months of September-Octo-
ber 1944, Spinnrath kicked repeatedly in the sto-
mach a Russian who died a few moments afterwards.
At the time of the evacuation of Schandelah
Camp in the direction of the Elbe(about the month
of April 1945) our train was stopped in a wood
where S-oiimrath gave orders to throw the bodies
of the dead out of the train. In my carriage
there were 6 dead men. $e had to dig a^pit in
which we had to put them. Afterwards, ^pinnrath
came to check the carriages and, seeing a sick
Dutchman, took him by the feet and dragged him up
to the ditch that we had dug, threw him on to the
dead bodies and began to dance on him laughing and
sayings I'll make him shut up now all right. He
gave as excuse tin t it would have wasted too much
time if it had been necessary to dig a new.grave
for him. Afterwards we were obliged to fill in
the grave with sand. I do not know whether the
Dutchman was Already dead at the moment when we
buried him and covered him with a layer of about
40cm..(«16 In.) of earth.

I know SPINNRAD who the Lageraeltes e. In this powerful position
he had a say in all matters within the conoentration camp.
He has frequently misused this position out of a feeling of
personal importance.
I have seen quite frequently that SPINNRAD beat prisoners.
In the late summer of 1944 the medical orderly ERICH J/APP
told me as follows: "HANS SPINHRAD has beaten a prisoner
and kicked him into Ms gx-oin in such a way that he died
of the consequences three days after." I, HERMANN STRUCK, had
to help in the removal of the body to the crematorium at BRUEITE.
I inspected the body and saw that the sex organisms were quite
swollen and Mscoloured. T e medical orderly explained to me
tlxat tMs haa been caused by a kick and that it was cause of death.

On 3 September 1944 1 was transferred to IMISHGaMMS where I was registered
under No.44 862; After a few days I was transferred with about 150 comrades
to the Oomaando at SCSiAJIDSLaH near BRUNSWICK.
At SCHaMEELAII there were about 700 trisorers with is of the foLlowing natio-
nalities* Spanish, Frenoh, Belgian, Dutch, German, Italian, Greek, Russian,
Perish, Lettish, Oaeoh, Y^ugoslaw and one Chinese. Later arrived a con-
tinent of Dims who did not have the same con it ions as the ot'mr pr isorers
JtjJjiuL
The most fearful man ti at I met was the Lager-aelteste Ham 3PIHRATH. >11
the Eapos beat prisomrs but sa® , such as Stephan Georges AJXliR and Erich
NAPP, mere through necessity than through malice. I admit that famished
prisoners are not always easy to guard. SPINR4TH hewever, struck, beat and
kUdied ths^ougli sadism, through love of doing harn. The si{|ht of blood excited
him like a wild animal, and the more sraxteddK his victim was tortired, the
mere he set about him.
About the middle of October I -saw Ham 1PIW1ATH beat a Russian who was working
a few metres away from nfe. Ife had in fact found on this Russian a little
piece of/tent covering (striped red and white;. The civilian management of
the camp had noticed that the prisoners vroxe cutting this cloth into pieces
and demanded sanctions aginst those who had been found carrying it. On the
discovery of this little piece of rag IPIHRaTH flung himself on this man who s
was already of a certain agsand, in spite of the supplications and laiiEntatiicsr
of the latter, administersd xattedcfeRksax sich kicks and punches on his whole
body, that after tfct seem the poof Russian lost a-lot of blood.
To describe tie cynicism of SplMATH, I am going to recount tte following
seem that I saw from the winder of the Revier ( inf inaaryj^
At .the beginning of April 194-5, when our departure from SQMJDSLAH was immimir!
dPIM®ATI! took a little barrel containing beetroots, and threw it towards a
group cf prisoners. In principle it was ferbiddsn to tsatefex toich these
, barrels. Hie barrel thrown by SFIM3ATH broke up and th e prisomra rushed
. to gst the beetroots which were lying in the mud. Then tie brute took store:
and amused hisaself by tirosing them at this mass of men. As tie prisoners
did not abandon their beetroots, Hans SPIKiRiSi took a heavy rope, threw hiase:
on the group and strict vigorously with alternate arms until his can strength
was exhausted.
In out temper ary camp at wD REBELIN' to which we had been evacuated fr era SCHANI
LAH, I saw tbs same IPIIIIR.TH kill a Russian. Having hurled himself on him,
he beat bin so hard and so long with his feet and his fists, that after a few
minutes the man stirred no more. I think that a kick with his iron-sole a
boot on the temple of tie poor prisoner finished him with a single kick.

terrible manner. Monsieur HaVALD was beaten in the face, on the head,
in the stomach and all,over.	At last he collapsed near the excavator

I an Louis ffcap^ois CiMU. bora 11 April 1905 at MX08T, fcrrnerly Conmiss^ire
Royal at the Ibfcaf'e Administrative, now a bank director.
I refer to the declarations which I i acte yesterday, ‘flhtrs&ay 27 Jum, concernii
the ppr&Tsl conditions <£ life at blie Goji^sando at S(2-IA.NISLaH, (fepsnderpy of the
SJSEKSaSSll NSUMGaWI Gorcon+.ration Camp, arai I am continuing these declarafcae
tions by ths fellowing details on the particular inoident^shich I re ember.
The Arbeitskapo lena'/n nafer the name cf IIATJE (alias Arthtr GROSSE) took
char^ cf tl© allocation of the isrisoners to different tasks. By the choice
that 1© made, he ©jsreisod a ’irect influ;n3« on the life, the state cf health
a* even the death of the prisoners. It was thus that by their allocation to
particularly hard tasks cid cen cs? nBii of poor liealth to when HiTJH was
vuisympatl^tic died off rapidly. Besides, HATJB chcse in consul.tation with
the oedioal csrderly the persons who, being too weak, were to go back to
where they probably were exter irnte . K1T3B knew this danger,
f<r tie peasantries current be tween hian aai the Kapos were to designate the
weak iren as destined for the Crematcr iun. Theca weak ae« were known by the
name of 'laUSSUTiiAN''.
SiST-I had a particulsc’ly brutal character. The least incident, fer example
arriving last in the column, or leaving a barrack room last, drew feem hin
very violent blows. Even when one went pdlitaly to ask hii for a piece cf
infer ationi iwi is pens able f cr the work, he often received one with blows.
It was thus that 1 ryself in October 1944, having developed a hi^i teriperattre
and not being able to be race ive d in the infir mar,- until the following day,
had, on erders of the medical orderly, to go and present nyself to HATJE who,
at that moment, was Kapo of a group which was building the railway, to ask
hi to allot ins fer that day another task than the handling of the pick.
iMJE welcomed me with such punches that I was flung to the ground and that I
lest , by a purch on the ear, the hearing of iqy left ear.
HA TUB was the exocutiomr of tie orders of the 83 when it was necessary to
Kake prisorers confess offerees which they were suspected of having canmitted.
It was thus that HATJS and the La^raelteste beat to ^ath three Letts who were
suepeoted of being in posasssion of a knife and preparing an escape plot.
These three Letts died of bio s and wounds; their bodies were exposed.
This incident took place in December 1944. In April 3.91-5 a young Frenchman
frori! the neighbourhood of GBRARO'fi was crislly beaten by the sajre two indi-
viduals. Continually, when 1© passed into tie work yards, BATJn teat the
prisoners, whether with his fist, a stick, a shovel cr even Plante. One day
when HATJS undertook to beat me for the ire ideirt which I shall expound below,
he felt the need of chasing out with blor/s of a plank a Russian who happened
to be in tl© erplosire where he was going to un^rtal© my mal-treairaent.
When at the morning, midday'' cr evening roll-call a prisoner coltepsed tlvough
a congestion due to cold or undernourishment, lUTJd would approach him and try
to bring him up with lci::te. It was he also who ordered that we should not
support sick son in the r«*nte, attempt to raise them up cr carry them to the
infirmary. On several occasions prisoners who had fainted in this way
remained lying in tie mul for several hours.
I pessonally was beaten a second time by HATJaS in connection with an alleged
theft of methylated spirit in the laboratory. The facts are as follows:
The methylated spirit was looted u|> in a cupboard in &he laboratory. A German
Vorarbe iter who was working at the furnace had, thanks to tha complicity of a
young Pole, procured the key of this cupboard and had emptied the bottle with
follow-Kapos. it was necessary to find a scapegoat to justify this theft.
As I myself had the previous day, at tbs request of a Kapo, given out a snail
quantity of spirit which was not locked up, the Kapos wished to ake hb, in﻿- 2 —
I2^|
the eyes of the civilians , responsible for the whole theft. HATJE employe d
the ncrvfial process: Ife began by beating m with his fists and with the handle
of a shovel. Knowing what awaited ra if X oontimed to maintain the truth,
I tdd bin that 1 wjlould admit ary thing wlptevsr. It was the drily mans
of avoiding being beaten to oath, as inised HaTJ•, had warned ce. rfhen I
had taken upon tt'self the responsibility of telling the German civilians,
that I was the perpetrator of/tfeft, HATJS let roe alone. It was because
I took tfjon i-yself this responsibility that the Kapo	demanded from
KSP1TJIS that I should re rain in the labcratcry. It was in a way a gjntlemaa’s
agreement.

One day about the end of September 1944 or eginning of October
1944 I personally was beaten by GROSSEj ffe hit we repeatedly
in the face. % face was bleeding and I lost consciousness.
After that I regained consciousness and in the evening I was
admitted to the infirmary where I remained for several weeks.
I have made this Deposition in the French language, which
I understand perfectly.

sworn before me 3/3GT. Frank "eter GOLDING, 8th K.R.I. Hussars, of
Sar Crimes Investigation Unit at BRUNSWICK, on lOth June 194-6.
I am Arthur Gustav Johannes GRQSSB, born onl2.5.190o, at
flAlaBURG, farm worker, of German nationality.
Tire written statements made by me on 9th i riT 1946 was read
to me to-day and I agree fully as to its content^.
About January 1945 I wanted to go to the laboratory where prisoners
were working. I ms told that I was not to enter the laboratory
again as on. the previous day a bottle of surgical spirit had been
>stolen and I waa the only stranger who had been there.
9r. HTOTER told me that he expected an explanation by lunchtime
or he would report the matter to the KamandofueVirer. Thereupon
I followed the matter up and asked several prisoners Whether they
had noticed anybody drunk on the previous day. I found out that
three Kapos Ixad been drinking the previous evening. That was Otto
KLEIN, Ernst kUELLKR and SJTKPHAN. I went to KLEIN then and asked
him where he had got the Schnaps from. He told me that he had got
it from OAHU of the laboratory. I went bake	laboratory
Uthen and asked for GA‘ U to be sc t out and	an
'explanation. CAJ-IU denied at first, had to admit later' however
that he had coomitted the theft to get some food.
After OMU had admitted I boxed his ears once or twice, had Dr.HEFTUR
called out and explained to him where the spirit had gone. Dr.HEFTUR
wanted to throw CAMU out, I persuaded him,however, to leave him in
his position.
As Kapo in diarge of work I had to ensure that order ms kept and
Imd to beat prisoners occasionally. I have never used anything
except ny hands for this however.

Among the capos, I must name Herbert oCHIaBIBL—

blocks! going to roll-call or to work. He employed
for that purpose a spade, a plank, whatever came handy.

SCHIEFFELBBIN was, in Block I, the ®JeJ^^ner
of the ususal punishments: twenty-five to fifty

which were usually trivial, for example having torn
up a blanket, having stolen a piece 0*

On 3 September 1944 I was transferred to NEUENGAIIME, and after seme days I
was sent to the Commando at SCHANDSLAH mar BRUNSWICK.
Those who caused us most suffering at SGHANIELAH were fellow prisoners like
ourselves who were entrusted hy the S3 with the maintenance of order in the
camp. Such were the Lagepalteste , Capos and Forarhe iters.
The worst of the Forar he iters was the ore in charge of the Ahladers (un-
loaders); I ha-ve for gotten his name, hut his features still live in my
memory. A former homer, hailing from HAMBURG, he exercised himself on the
few prisoners of whom he had the charge in the Ccmmando of Abladers.
I will cite the case of a young Frenchman from B0RD3ACK, Maurice IBCS, who
told me many tines that he had been beaten and that he had seen several of
his comrades beaten by tie Fcrarbeiter of the Ahladers.
I personally have on several occasions seen the said Fcrarbeiter heat French

o. Sergt. Frank Peter GOLDING, 8th King's Royal
Irish Hussars, of War Crimes Investigation Unit at
Brussels 01 the 28th June 1946;
I am Louis Francois CAMU, born on the 11th April
1905 at Alost, formerly Commissaire Royal at the Re -
forme Administrative, now a bank director.
I refer to the declarations that I made yesterday,
the 27th June, concerning the general conditions
of life at the Commando of Schandelah, depeadenfe-oijf^
the concentration camp of iJeuengamme, and I am don-
tinning those declarations with the following de -
tails on the particular incident which I remember:
The Commandant CBSSN was extiemely exacting for
the work, and when he went about the workyards,bru-
tally incited the capos to strike the prisoners to
make them work more actively. One day, I saw him
enter a small place where there were two Belgians,
since -deceased, and be ..t them because they were not a
at work. Often, when he passed on inspection along
the ranks, 33SEN did not hesitate to beat with his
whip soap-body whose oearing did not pie se him.
SBSEN was evidently responsible for the orders
given to kill those who arrived late for roll-call,
such as the case of the two Poles, which I recalled
in my preceding deposition. When a prisoner was
brought before him for a trivial incident in the
workyard, he would beat him himself. These acts
of violence were the more serious as EBSSN was often
the worse for drink. The Letts who were killed fol-
lowing the incident concerning their alleged possess-
ion of a knife, were killed with the knowledge of
•j33EN. It was the same with those who were slain
vith rifle shots in the group which 7/as working

at Schandelah UBSEN was Commando Puhrer. One
day in the course of the month of December, a young
Belgian about 18 years old tried to escape, out he"
was taken a little 1 ter in the neighbourhood of
the camp. The fugitive was brought before EB33N
who began to beat him on the head, at first with
his fists, then with a stick about 4 cm. (=1 1/2 in.)
thick. The victim collapsed, covered with bloody
and died on the following day without recovering
consciousness. I have even ascertained that EB -
SEN appropriated the prisoners' bread rations by
the fact that during an inspection by a board of
3S and civilians, one of the latter asked in how
many parts, a loaf was divided eaish morning, there-
upon I heard BBSSN answer: one loaf for five people.
Actually a loaf was divided into 9 parts.
I hove seen on many occasions that SBoEN

I \ms a member of the Social Democratic Party since 1906 and have never

-the conditions ±Bx8ti&itS£Stt6&ix prevailing in the SGHANDKLAH Camp. There
v/oi-e E3 prisoners of various nationalities including Russians, French,
Belgians, Dutch, Italians and others employed there.
The prisoners were constantlyhungry and often too feeble to walk, never-
theless they were always driven to work which was often verystrenipus.
Frequently prisoners collapsed during work and when that happened they
were still driven and beaten by Kapos. Almost daily ^ome prisoners
died.
In our office there was a Russian prisoner working whom we called Georg.
In about February 1945 this prisoner entered the office carrying two
.buckets iritikh in his hands. Camp coiimiandant EB3BK was In the office.
The prisoner could not raise his bap as he had something in either hand.
EBoEM approached him and slapped his face severely with his hsiide. The
prisoner was bleeding from the nose raid mouth. , EBSEN shouted at the
prisoner that he should take his cop off. we in the office were all
very indignaS^Sed about this occurrence, which was typical for the behaviour

Deposition on oath of Friedrich 5BSSN, male, of RICKIjING ueher
FEDMUSNSTER at present ALTfUA PRISON, sworn before me. Captain
William Richard DURNDEIli, East Surrey Reg.'jment of War Crimes
Investigation Unit, BAOR, on the 22.4* 1946.
I am Friedrich EBSEN, born 6.6.1888 in
GUEIDSNSTSIN, Kreis OLDERBURG, gamekeeper, of German nationality.
I -
I ms employed until the 1st July 1942 as a ,
technical employee with the "Innere Mission" and until October
1942 by the Navy Supply Depot. I received orders to report to
the S3 reinforcement depot at QRANIENBURG by the 20th October
1942. Ten days later I was moved to BEJCHEN\TALD where I was
given a uniform and later on I was transferred,as a guard,to
FLCXSiiSIIBURG/Oberpf alz.	I was transferred to NEUSNG A IMS on the
5th January 1943. I reraiined in NEUENGAMME until 25th July 1943
when I was put in charge of the debris clearance detachment
HAMBURG, Heidenkampsweg, later at ERACKDAMM-SCIJULE, Suederstrasae.
In December 1943 I was transferr d back to NEUMGAMME and at the
end of February 1944 I came to the WITTMBEHGE Concentration Camp.
I came back to NEUEKGAMMS by the end of June 1944 and on the 11th
of August I took charge of the detachement at SCHANDELAH where up
to that time Oberscharfluhrer JAUCH had been detachment-leader.
When I took over the camp at SCHANDSLAH I was
an Unterscharfuhrer. I commanded 55 S3 guards. At the time
when I took over the camp it held about 500 prisoners. A
further 500 prisoners were sent to me in March 1945* These
500 prisoners had been marched to HELMSTKDT from PORTA in
WESTPHALIA. Fran HOLMST IDT they were moved to SCHANDKLAH by
rail. These men were in such a poor physical condition that
they were absolutely useless for any work. I refused to take
than as I had no room in the camp and telephoned about it on
several occasions to NSUENGAMMS. Finally I received an order
from Untersturmfuhrer POPPETJIAGEN and had to take the prisoners.
As the camp had, by that time, already been filled up with 800 men,
it thus finally contained 1300 men.
The prisoners in the camp were of all
nationalities apart from Jews.
*	The responsibility for the camp was solely
mine. Prof. WITTIG did everything for the camp I asked him to
do.
All beating of prisonersvas forbidden in the
camp. S3 men were not allowed to enter the camp except on
a few occasions when they had to go to the workshops. The
duty of the S3 men was purely the guarding of the prisoners.
The guards were not allowed to beat the prisoners. I had,
however, detailed two older S3 men whose offers were to patrol
the area continuously and who had to see to it that the work
was carried out. These have beaten prisoners on occasions.
About the end of February I published an
appeal to the prisoners, asking them that they should do their﻿-2-
duty because they vrere receiving additional rations as well as a
bonus -which would be withdrawn if our output was not kept up. I
published tills anpeal because I continuously received complaints
that not enough work was being done.
These complaints were being made by the manage-
ments of the firms Kalk and Zement and the D323AG. Especially
by Herren FRITZEN, FFEIFFSR, HES'^TER, KL0IB3R, 3IK L, and KOCH.
During the conferences of the works managements it was frequently
discussed that the output of v/ork was insufficient and consequently
Prof. ,T "1I0 and Herr (IILMT would come to me to discuss the matter.
They made it quite clear that unless more work was done the bonus
would be withdrawn. Thereupon I made the previously raentioned
appeal so that the good workers sho Id not suffer ith the bad ones.
Apart from that I ordered the two 3S man to make sure that every
prisoner did his duty.
I drew my rations through	directly from
B1 TJN8WICK. The quantities were laid down by BRHETTE in accordance
with the general regulations governing concentration camp prisoners.
I did, however, draw additional rations consisting of potatoes,
turnips and dried peas. In my opinion the food lor the prisoners
in the camp SC11AHDELAH was better than in other concentration camps.
The prisoners theraselv s have confirmed this to me.
The firm Kalk and Zement were responsible for the
supply of necessary medicines. X submitted a monthly indent of
medicines and dressings to the firm Kalk and Zement. This indent
was always passed anc the materials were collected by the ration
lorry from the KI"ITELUNCrEIN-Apotheke in ER’iNSWICK. Consequently
we always had an ample supply of medicines.
The firm Kalk and Zement were responsible for a
sufficient supply of fuel for the camp. If ray stocks had been
reduced to an 8 days supply I called "up Herr G-CRSLER and always
received new deliveries. All stoves in the ptison camp -/ere heated
from the middle of October onwards and th re was always sufficient
fuel available. On one occasion whan coal had not been supplied
I refused to march out to work and consequently coal was fetched
directly from BRUNSWICK.
During the time I was Camp Comandant, about &0 -
70 of the 800 prisoners whom I had in the camp, died. I^do not
know how many of the prisoners v/ho had arrived in a weakened condition
from PCHTA have died.	hilst I was camp conmandant Ijrcturned
about 200 prisoners,who were sick and of no use for any further work,
to NEUEN&AIffifZ, and received fresh prisoners in easehange. Of these,
however, 10 to 15}& wore also sick. Of the 60 - 70 men who died
out of the first 800 prisoners, about one half died of stomach
trouble, the others of weak heart or accidents. No one was beaten
to death but one or two ian^iiwd whilst trying to escape*	v
'>L«^r	>
I had made arrangements for an orderly cemetery.
Until March the prisoners were buried in single graves and in a
coffin. I had a cross erected on each mound showing the narae of
the deceased.	After March the firm Kalk and Zement were unable
to supply timber for coffins and the prisoners were buried side by
side.
About the end of March I received a written order
from the commandant in NEUENG-AMME to the effect that the cemetery﻿was to “be leveled and that there should remain neither mounds nor
crosses.	1 ordered Unterscterfuhrer TOTfSCSfU. to comply with
this order. The latter hat] ttlso been In charge of funerals.
Afterwards the oesuetery \mn separated from the sui-rounding country-
side by a barbed wire fence only.
Tiio order for an ira ediate evacuatian of th '
camo was giv>'n by hersturoiftihrer WSO MAM about the middle of April.
e were to evacuate to WOB'i&IH near JJfDVXBQtl&iK . I requested the

to the siding and loaded up. Ta.mrJs evcaiin* we departed and
arrived two lays later at LTF* finnuxv?. Cue day it was reported
to me by a Frenchman that murderous weapons wore beiny forged
seci-etly In preparation of an attack on the ;juarckj. This caused
me to be extremely strict. A cr ock of the oaip brought to light
most dangerous knives and daggers. furthermore it was reported to me
by Herr LUTZ that his pistol had bocst stolen out of the car and It©
believed 'a prisoner to be tl'se culprit. Hhterseharfuhr r THU'jCIMj
also lost a pistol on the working sit© and t Is one was never found
again. I gave instructions to the ka|>os to keep a sharp look out
that no plots for an .attack on the guards could be prepared. I
cons!tiered this affair myself and had to reproach myself for having
been too kind-hearted with the prisoners. I did not make a
further report about the matter. 3lx — eight culprits wore tied
and load to sit all ni ht on a chair and later on had to do liar<3
labour after 1 had tried in vain to interrogate thorn. The principal
criminal escaped and was shot wh ist tryin to do so.	. I believe

1946;
I am Louis Francois CAMU, oorn on the 11th
ipril 1905 at Alost/formerly Commissaire at the
Reforme Administrative, now a bank director.
I refer to the declarations that I made
yesterday Thursday, the 2?th June, concerning
the general conditions of life at the Commando
of Ochandelah, dependent, o^the Neuengamme con-
centration c mp, and I a?m continuing those de -
clarations with the following details on the
particular incident that I remember:
Dr. H3FT2R cannot be held directly respon-
sible either for beating and wounding or for
Ill-treating the prisoners. But he reported
the numbers of those who worked too little
directly to the C0ndo-Fiihrer.	He continu-
ally demanded, by his applications to the latter,
as well as by his snouts to the capos, that the out-
put should be accelerated.
When I asked him to allot a less arduous
task to M. VERHASGSN of GHENT, aged 55, who was
on the point of dying, he answered me: "If he
is an advocate, let hi}j die like a dog".
In the incident related elsewhere concerning
the theft of (methylated) spirit from th® labor -
atory, he c died on the arbeitscapo to clear up.
the affairand impose penalties^ he knew that this
meant that the victim would be beaten very brutally.
Moreover, in common with the other engineers
attached to the establishment, HEFTER knew the
wretched conditions of work, hygiene, food and
sustenance under which we were living. He saw
every day that 2 or 3 prisoners were brought back
dying from the works, or from the furnace, to the
sickbay. He was, in addition, often.present at
the parades and saw those who were lying on the
ground or h.'-d been brought buck on wheelbarrows.

Deposition on oath of Otto HEFTi-R, male, of lol CIC,
sworn before me, Ca;t. Richard William DURJTDETIj, East
Surrey Regt, of War Crimes Investigation Unit BAOR
at ESTEB'/BGEN on the 2oth of April 1946.
I am Otto HEFTER, born 19.2.19o5 in ASi'IIAFF-dSI1!®, chemist,
of German nationality.
I was employed by the technical high school in BRUNSWICK
as a scientific ass istant. I ism* in charge of the labora ,ory
of the "Forschungsinatitut fuer Natur-Asphalt" (research
in; titute for natural asphalt). Head of the institute was
Professor SOLMS-WITTIG. WITTIG was also general manager of
the DASAG combine. The Kalk- and Zcmentwerke, SCBAIDALAH,
belonged to the combine. Dui’ing the night of October l'i/l5» 19^t4j
the research institute was almost completely destroyed during an
enemy a_r raid. Having salvaged the remaining instruments I
received an order from Prof. WITTIG at about the beginning
of November 1944 to move to SCilANDJSLAH with what was left of
the research institute.
I received my wages from the technical high school at JlKlffi bV-iCK*
and not from the DASAG combine. At Christmas I received a
bonus of about EM 2oo//j5oo,- from the DASAG combine as most _
of the work of the research institute was for the DASAG combine.
This was about half the sum which I ’..-ould have received if
I iiad been an eployee of the DASAG in a similar position.
My monthly wages amounted to about HM loo,—*
The inauguration of the Kalk- and Zementwerke was approved and
financed by the State. The purpose was the production of oil
from shale. Labour was needed for the construction of the
works and later on for it; operation. As far as I ;maw the
demand for labour was made through the State. The latter could
only supply concentration camp prisoners.
As far as I know work ms commenced during April or May 1944.
To rny knowledge about 5o prisoners were employed at the be-
ginning. The number of prisoners increased to about 8oo by-
November 1944 and remained at that figure until about the end
of March. I remember that on one occasion sick prisoners were
exchanged for fit ones.in HEWB&AMME. The number may have been
around loo. Towards the end of March or the beginning of April
about 4oo more prisoners carat to SCHAABSLAH from the West. The
nationalities of the prisoners were German, Russian, polish,
Dutch, French, Belgian and Danish.
The prisoners had their work allocated to them by the civilian
foremen through, the kapos or the prisoner foremen. It was
forbidden to give any direct orders to prisoners.﻿Production No.
- 2 -
Conimandofuehrei• EBSt.N lectured to us on intercourse with
prisoners once every four weeks. A-il private intercourse with
prisoners was strictly forbidden. Only essential orders were
to be given to the kapos. If any ; risoners did not work or
co:caiitted other offences like theft or broaches of discipline
a report had to be made through official channels to the de-
tachment leader. As ever, thing was in good order in iqy department
I had to make reports about lazjness only in one or two cases.
i»y the end of December I'j-k- it was reported to me that some
methylat- d piirit; hau been stolen from the laboratory. I dis-
cussed this matter with kayo KOSSiANN, who was called KEMB HT.
He told me that the methylated s irits had been stolen by the
Belgian CAMU. CAMO admitted the theft but refused to make any
further statem.nt. It would have been my duty to report this
■case to the detachment-leader. The immediate; consequence of this
would iiave been a transfer of CAMU and I ould have lost a valuable
worker. I did not make a report as this would have impeded the
work. CAMU had not stolen the methylated spirits for his own
advantage but had acted n the orders of a prisoner, presumably
a kapo.
I deny ever having ; iven orders for the beating of prisoners.
I had no such powers over the concentration camp prisoners. I
merely had bo instruct the kapos and foremen as to what work
, as to be none,
I have seen frequently that prisoners were beaten by formen or
kapos. Generally hands were used for such beatings but occasionally
also rubber hoses. Towards the en< of the war unwillingness to work
increased to such an extent that EBSkN had to detail a number of
SS—men - I believe four - for the purpose of supervising the
building site. These liad to see to it that all prisoners who
left their place of work and strolled round the area doing nothing
or hid the, selves in unobser ved comers were made to work*
As far- as I know about 14o prisoners died in .SbFANPiLAB until
April 1945.

I am Louis Francois CADJ, born on the 11th

I refer to the declarations that I-made yester

I am contSLntking those decl -rations with the follow-

members
Dr. GA-RLEPP, according to whnu^was bold me by
Fraulein BaCJIaNN and by Dr. MONNIG, was responsible
for tne evacu ti u of the camp to '■ oBBCLINt It
must nave been he wlio employed his authority as a
Parry Member to obtain from the militcry author! -
ties the carriages and the locomotive necessary for
cur transportation. This decision brought about
the deaths of several hundreds of prisoners of the
Allied Nations. The other civilians of the camp,
evidently insisted that this decision to evacuate
snould be taken because they feared tne revenge of
tne prisoners if the latter ware let loose in the
neighbourhood.

From 1938 until 1943 I worked on constructional work ad
as technical manager in Roumania. After completion of
my constructional work with the German firm I changed over
to a Roumanian Firm, because I did not want to return to
Germany, During the war I was taken over by the
continental oel A.G. and in May I was sent to ESTONIA
to take over an Oil Refinerie. Before the Russians
arrived in March or April 1944 I was evacuated and return
ne d to Berlin. In June 1944 I was sent to Italy to
work in a Refinery. In August 1944 I returned to Germany,
joinedthe Deutsche Bergwerks und Hiitten Bau GmbH

Deposition on oath of ARTHUR Gustav Johannes GR0SS1, male, of
SQMNDELAj:! 97» near Brunsvd-ck, sworn before me, Oapt. W*R. DDPNDELL,
East Surrey Regiment of War C lines Investigation Unit B.A.O.R.,
at SCHAIiDELAH on Tuesday 9th April 194-6.
I am ARTHUR Gustav Johannes GROSSE, bom 12.5. 1906, farm labourer,
of German nationality.
The SCHANBELAH camp was started in April 1944. The SGHAMDELAH camp
was under the comiuand of the NEUENGAMME camp and all prisoners and
guards came from thexe.
When I arrived in Sept timber 1944 the camp already consisted of
about 300 prisoners, so that with my transport of 100 men there
were 400 men there. !e were evacuated on 10 April 1945* At that
time the detachment consisted of 1500 men.
Of these 1500, ah xut 170 were Frenchmen, about 200 Poles, 200
Russians, 30 Czechs, 15 Dutch, 120 Danes ( former Danish police)
200 Belgians, and the rest of various nationalities.
Between September 1944, when I arrived, and April 1945* about
200 of the camp inmates died. Of these 15 to 20 men died by
shooting, at least 5 as a result of beating and the rest through-
starvation.
The camp commandantur was composed as follows :
Camp Commandant
2 i/c
Dog-trainer
Kitchen-bhef
SS man
Dog-trainer
SS Unt erscharfuehrer Friedrich EBSEfJ,
S3 Unter 3eharfuehrer Karl TRUSC255L,
SS Karl HEINZ,
SS JAM,
HENNINGS,
Rottenfuehrer SS SCHENAWA.
These are the only SS-men whom I can at present remember. In the
camD there were about 30 active SS-men and a further 45 the
Waffen-S3.
The following two firms were responsible for the work:
The firm Kalk - und Zementwerke, SCHANDISLAH, and
the firm ISSJAG, Bimnswick.
The following civilians were responsible for the work:
Throughout the period : Professor WP TIG, as general manager.
Dr. 0HEEN, of Hamburg, as his representative.
Until November 1944	: Oberst SCHULZ, as nsmager of Kalk-und Zementwerke
His successor was Dr. SIEGEL until March 1945, ^hose successor was
Dr. GL0EBER until the end.﻿Production No. 3 ^
Dr. Kurt (MRIfflP had a special task in spying around the works.
Dr. HFSFTM was in charge of the experimental installation and the
laboratory* his assistant was BROCKHA.USEN.
LKNZMANN ms a representative of the Ministry of Economics.
Anton KOCH was at first supervising engineer but lost his post _
because he ms too popular with the prisoners and was given a job
in the office.
Joseph KOCH was in charge of permanent way const met ion.
CAPIUS worked in the engineering office.
Dr. FRIT ZEN was supervising engineer of DEBAG-.
SCID2URER was in charge of loco-running.
August MUEELER was foreman of the slate gang.
WED1® was supervising engineer of DEBA& at the beginning.
Hans SP3NNRAD was Lageraelteater fresn Nov. 1944 to tVie end.
KNUBEFEL was Lageraeltester fi*om Apill 1944 till Nov. 1944*
The following were Kapos :
Otto SCHMIDT, Otto KLEIN, MUELLER, STEPHAN and myself.
The camp consisted of three living-huts, one sick-bay, the lavatory
and the" wash-room. The camp was surrounded by a high barbed wire fence
which was electrically charged. In each living hut there were
accomodated 450 prisoners. In the sick-bay there were at most times
100 men. The beds were three tieWand there were always two men^ in .
each bed. There were two to tliree blankets for two men. In each
hut there were two stoves. To heat these we had to steal coal as we
did not receive any fuel.
We received food as follows:
At 0530 lira about 1/4 Itr. Ersatz coffee and one slice of bread
( one three-pound loaf for 12 men ) .
At 1200 hrs 1£ Itr soup made of turnips or carrots.
At I83O hrs there was one loaf of "bread for four men and 10 gr* or
margarine each and about ^ Itr. of Ersatz ooiiee.
If we did particularily heavy work there was occasionally an extra
litre of soup for up to 40 men.
Every man had his own spoon but there were only enough mess tins
for about 2/3 of the men.
The time table ms as follows:
0500 hrs Reveille
0530 * Coffee
0600	* March-off for ftfqwtk
1200	»• 1300 hrs Midday meal
1300 hrs March-off for work
1830	” Knock-off work
1900	"	Supper
2100	*'	Lights out.
The work ms carried out by about 35 detachments. The largest detachment
of about 100 men worked dm railway construction. A detachment o
about 70 men worked in the shale quarry* another one of about 46 men
worked in two shifts on the experimental furnace where oil was
extracted. Other detachments of 40 to 45 men worked on constructional
work as carpenters and bricklayers. The rest were split up into
smaller detachments.﻿Production No« olA^
The purpose of the -work was to extract oil and petrol. Altogether
the work was very hard especially as the wen were weak. If the work
was not done fast enough the men were reported hy the civilian'
supervisor.
Clothing consisted of a shirt, trousers, and a jacket made of a thin
material and only towards the end of February did we receive a woolen
vest and thicker trouser-3 and jackets, but this was only after the
winter. During the winter it was very cold and any contracted pneumonia
and died. Many died at the working site.
Before my arrival the washing was done by a 'aundry in Brunswick.
This laundry, however, was burned dawn and at the time of 147 arrival
there had already been no fresh laundry for a long time. Only during
the last months were two prisoners detailed to do sane washing do
that there were about.200-300 clean shirts available per week. We
could not do the washing ourselves because there was not enough water
or soap.
In tire tailoring shop we could not have any repairs done as it was
fully engaged on work for the SS.
For guard-duties there were available about ?6 US-men. Outside de-
tachments were guarded at the rate of about 1 3S-raan to every 10
prisoners. The SS-rnen were all armed with rifles and were responsible
for the prisoners. Civilian foremeh were responsible for the work.
We could report sick before and after wox’k with the exception of those
who collapsed outside. The latter were removed to the sick-bay.
In the sick-bay there were beds for 50-60 men. The beds were in
three tiers and always occupied by two men. The sick were sorted cut
according to their illness, so that there were always cases of a
similar natrfare in the same beds. This sorting as done by doctors
who were themselves prisoners. We had two qualified doctors -
one a Frenchman and one an Hungarian. The third one was a German
medical orderly who did dressings etc. We were always very short of
medicines and dressings because the Kalk— und Zementwerke refused
to spend substantial, amounts on those indents. Due to that there was
at most times no dressing material available.
If prisoners were sick to a point of death they were moved in batches
of up to 80 men on lorries to NEUMGAMME and were there exchanged for
healthy men. There were three such transports whilst I wa,s at 3CHANDELAH.
If any prisoners died in the camp the death certificate was made out
by Dr. med. ZCHIRH5 from the village of SCIIAND3LAH* At the time when
I came to 3CHAHDELAH the dead were taken to the crematorium at DRUEiTTE.
Frcm then on the prisonex’s were buried at the works. Coffins were
provided only for Danes who were buried in individual graves. The
others were put into graves in twos and tlirees. Altogether during
these 5 months 150 were buried.
At the time when I came to SCHANDELAH there was not even drinking
water in the camp. Water for cooking purposes was fetched m a cart.
A piped supply was taken to the camp during November but froae
shortly afterwards. Washing.facilities consisted of two troughs with
20 water thus under which 1500 men were supposed to wash in half an
hour. Tliis ms impossible. Apart from that there was no water most
times and there were only 30 towels for each block of 450 men.
The latrine consisted of 8 buckets with akssa a board put across
the containers which were emptied daily.﻿GV
Production No«
There was a considerable amount of lice which made life so liard for
us that we could not sleep at night* Nothing was done about this*
Dr. HSFTER approached the detachment leader* EBdEN with a proposal
to get some anti-lice insecticide. ES.JEN replied as follows : H There
are no lice in the camp and if you concern yourself about camp matters
again I s'nall have you locked up in dt yourself, w
The only privilege we had was letter writing. We were permitted to
write and to receive one letter per month.
On 10th April at 10 a.m. an Oberstumfuehrer of the S3 came to the
camp commandant and ordered him to leave the camp within two hours.
Consequently everyone had to get Ms blankets, and provisions were
loaded and taken to Stfee station. The prisoners were marched to the
station at SCHAND IAH. We were loaded into box trucks, 50 men to
each waggon. Between 5 and 6 p.m. we began to move in the direction
of LUDWIG-SlJJST. We reached STENBAL the same day, MA&DEBTJRG- on the
11th and WITTENBERG® on the 12th. Daring that night I escaped.
The minimum punishment in the camp was the withdrawal of the bonus
of RM 1to RM 5.- in case of complaints by civilian supervisors about
laziness or insolence. For similar reasons the midday meal could
be wit held or 10.15 or 25 strokes be given with a wooden stick.
All punishment uns. ordered by Camp Commandant EB3EM and carried out
by the S3.
The Kapos had to keep the prisoners working at the beginning. The former
were, however, not strict enough and were replaced by three S3-men
in December. These beat the men from -oming till night. I specially
remember HENNINGS. During February 1945 I saw HENNINGS beat a French-
man with a broken-off spade handle which he used to carry round
with Mm. These blows mainly hit the head. The man was unconscious,
and bled profusely from a head wound. We took Mm to a sick bay where
he was given a heart strengtheMng injection. He did, however, not
regain consciousness and died durin: the same night. He was buried
in the wood.
Director GLO' BER called up the Camp Commandant KB3BN or went to Mm
personally day after day to complain about the men. Fox- tMs he
used every pretext, for example, if a man rested for one moment
or if somebody lit a fire to warm himself in the bitter cold.
I remember that the Camp Commandant EBSBN frequently went across
the working site after such telephone calls and oeat up people.
For this he used a rubber truncheon with which he hit people in
the small of the back.
The Kapo Ernst M' TJIISR detested Russians especially. '&e E'apo who
worked in the sick bay came to me frequently to complain about
Kapo MUEHiER beaause the latter had once again mistreated someone
so badly that he had to be taken to the sick-bay.
During January or February 1945 XJhterscharfuefcrer TRUSCHSL lost a
pistol. One of the prisoners reported that it had been found by a
Russian. At 2100 Ms IRUSCHEL and 3PIMRAD appeared in the camp
and fetched out the Russian. The latter was to look Nor the istol.
A little later SPINNRAB returned and cold us tliat RUoGHEL had
shot the uxsian* from behind. Two prisoners wore then ordered to
fetch the shot prisonsr with a stretcher. The body ms buried in
the wood.
At the beginMng of March 1945 two prisoners wore missing at evening
roll.-call. All the .guards and Kapos and foremen had to search the﻿6#

area. I was with the dog-trainei Karl HEINZ, SPINi-iRAD, and another
foreman, fe entered a shed and the dog showed towards one coiner.
There were the two prisoners. We etched out the first prisoner and
suddenly there was a bang and the prisoner collapsed. He trid bo n
hit in the heart by a s'fiot which HEINZ had fired from about 5 yds.
away. SPUffiTRM) and rayaelf were frightened and ran away to report to
the Camp Commandant. We were only about 20 yds away when there was a
second shot. This hit the other prisoner in the back of the head.
Both were ussians. Later they were buried in the wood.
I know that HEINZ had shot more men on the railway construction job.
I know of at least three cases, all Russian prisoners. When I asked
HEINZ on one occasion why he shot these, he replied : " I shall knock
out every Russian, because they murdered my parents."
It also happened frequently that various oS-men whom I do not remember
by name shot people " whilst trying to escape".
In Sum or July 1945 the Russian Lieutenant VASSILIEV came to rae
to SC MDELAH and requested me to hand to him the book in which I
had made entries of all those inmates who had died.
I as arrested on 19.5.1937 because I had a free fight with a Nasi.
I was taken to the Concentration Camp at Hamburg/fruhlsbuettel.
The treatment there was so harsh that I made a confession that I
had circulated forged money together with some others. On 14 June
1937 I was sentenced to 4 years hard labour which I spent at Papen-
burg. On 4 June 1941 Iin&s collected from there by the Gestapo and
returned to the Concentration Camp NEUENGAlf lE. On 7 Sept. 1942
I was taken to 3CHANDELAH where I became a Kapo after three or four-
days.

I lived in the USA fro® April 192% - July 1934* where I was employed
as an engineer for various coi^mnies. In July 1931 I was naturalised
as an American citizen. I lost my citizenship due to ray stay in w

ihe output of work of the prisoners ms very low. I calculated that I

1,	This case is being investigated by War Crimes
Investigation Unit, and it now transpires that a certain
John GLUCK a national of South Africa and a Doctor by ,*
profession was imprisoned in the a/n jail.
2.	It is equally clear that GLUCK was working in
a German hospital during the War and that he took.part in
underground anti-Nazi activities, which lead to his arrest
by the Gestapo and arrival in FU1ILSBUTTEL Prison.
3.	in this prison there were a considerable number of
Allies and there are allegations of severe maltreatment
and torture. GLUCK himself is supposed to have been
severely mishandled and to have been kept for eight weeks
in a dark cell, and to have been severely beaten after an
attempt to escape.
4,	The position with regard to GLUCK.in Germany
during the War is not quite clear, but it is thought that
he may have considerable knowledge about the activities
of the Gestapo staff of the prison in relation to Allied
nationals there interned.
5	it would be appreciated if. an affidavit could be
obtained from him, and for this purpose his present address
is:
46, 8th Ave Bez Valley, JOHANNESBURG,

6.	In particular it is required to ascertain
experiences in the FUKLSBUTTEL prison, both as regards him-
self and Allied nationals. His affidavit should also
deal with the Commandant *(DES8MAN'H,r, and two other Gestapo
men R03TTGER and 0EW
7,	If he has any information relating to the prison
doctor, Dr. SCHNAPPAUF and a further member of the Gestapo

I am a ,Madical Practitioner residing at 46,
8th. Avenue, Bezuidenhout Valley, Johannesourg*
At the outbreak of the war in September 1939»
I was a civilian working at the University Hospital
FRI2DRICHSBE3®, HAMBURG* I am a South African by
birth, I was. born in JOHANNESBURG on 1?*2*1906* I was
& medical student at the Witwatersrand University,
and went over to GERMANY to complete my studies*
At the outbreak of war, I was told by Mr du Piessis
Consul-General for South Africa in Germany, to make
for the Danish Border with the intention of going
to ENGLAND via SWEEDEN for the purpose of joining
the British Army* I did not enter Danish Territory
as while on my journey I was arrested by the German
Police at FLENSBORG on the Danish Border, and detained
there for one night* Under escort I was returned t*
HAMBURG* I was released in HAMBURG and told to
report to Police headquarters the next day*
Immediately on my release, I went to see Captain
F»BREEMER a former South African Consul-General
who intervened on my behalf to the Police President,
and as a result I was not put into an internment
camp, but had to report to Police headquarters, firstly
once a day, then twice a week, then once a weekly then
once a month, and I resumed work at the hospital and
was left entirely alone*
Not being able to enlist in the army, I decided
to do what I could for the Allied cause* I was at
the time in the possession of two powerful wireless
receiving sets* The German authorities knew this as
the sets were registered* I was associated with
a group of people, most of them Germans, some
foreigners who I knew were pro-Ally in their feelings,
and vary anti-Nazi* The names of some of these people
are :
(1)	Mrs F,WILDE and family, both went to
concentration camps,the husband died while
in camp of starvation*
(2)	Dnderoffisier ERNST ROHM of the German Police*
{3) Dr*H*.LORD from PERU employed at the hospital*
(4) M*RASPE, British subject and wife who lived
in Germany all their life*
These were the principal leaders of the party,
but there were many others*
It was the custom of our group to collect Allied
news and spread such news to people who were on the
verge, and a little of such propaganda would probably
help to bring them to the Allies side*
In these efforts we were very successful* This
went on for some time* In the year 1940, I contacted
a certain Mr*P0RTER, I do not know if this is his
correct name* I contacted him through a Sweedish
Lady^a certain Dr LILY STROMBERG in HAMBURG, and
tiirougti her, j eent out certain information »t﻿(2)
Yarious times to Mr»POBTER who wag residing at
MALMO in SWEDM* This lady was than stopped from
returning to GERMANY and the contact was" broken. The
last time she was there was either the end of 1Q41
of the beginning of 1942,
I carried on and tried to look for * new contact
which I thought I had found in the two Norwegian *
Priests in iiAMBURG, Their names were :
Pastor A,SERGE,
do SVENSON*
who eventually proved to be of the greatest assistance.
Concurrentlyj I contacted a woman who was recommended
to me as a Swedish subject and a person who could
get me out of Germany, She was described to me as
a British Agent, Her name was Mrs GLASS—TOFOHR»
I contacted her several times during about 3 or 4
weeks* and during the course of such contacts I
gained the conviction that she was reliable as she
mentioned several names of people whom I knew to be
very reliable. She said she was an agent not for
mercenary purposes but for idealism. She promised
to get me a passage on a Swedish boat from" LUBECK,
Immediately after this* HAMBURG was destroyed
during the bombing raid which commenced on Julv 24,
1943,	.	*
Immediately after the raid was over the Norwegian
Priests came to see me and told me that I could be
smuggled through to SWEDEN, together with my fiancee,
now my wife,with a group of about 40 to 50 Swedes
who were residing in HAMBURG and had been bombed
out completely. The two of us joined the party at
LUBECK, the leader of the party knew our identity,
he was a Swedish Priest, le spent the night in the
Swedish Church at LUBECK, and were supposed to leave
by boat the next morning. Just before boarding the
boat the leader of the party had informed me that
30 Gestapo people had arrived and that I would
endanger the whole party, so myself and fiancee
returned to KANBURG* The Norwegian priests promised
to arrange another passage the next week. While in
HAMBURG awaiting a passage, I was arrested in my
room at the hospital by the Gestapo Officer REINEARD,
( who when the Allied Forces came in committed suicide
immediately)* My room was thoroughly searched and
certain documents and two automatic pistols were found.
The radio in the roam was also confiscated, I was
taken to the prison at FUELSBUTTEL, and placed in
solitary confinement. At the time of my arrest I
did not know who had given me away, but later I
learned it was the Swedish woman Gestapo agent
GLASS-TOFQHR,
I was left in solitary confinement for 4 days
before I was interrogated for the first time by
REINHARB in the presence of TESSMAN who was the
Commandant of the prison.
Prior to the first interrogation I was given a
beating up by RSINHARD, He assaulted me with his
fists, and told me that was only a sample of what
was coming, I received about S to 10 blows on the
face. In the course of the next few months I was
interrogated many times and received several beatings
up, in each case only fists were used when REINHARB
assaulted me, but there were occasions when TESSMAN
the Commandant entered my cell for no reason and
assaulted me. He would enter my cell and use the
most frightful language on me. He would then in a
sneering manner say to me ” You are waiting for the
Allies to^come; You will swing long before this war
is over; In case the Allies should ever eater, every﻿
(3)
oae of you will be shotw» H© would thea, with three
large pass keys hinged together* hit me under the
jaw with them, holding the keys firmly ia his hand
sometimes he drew blood* Blows with such keys held*
in his hand acted like blows received frem a knuckle
duster* Such assaults sometimes took place at
night time when I was in bed*
In the beginning of 1944 I had by that time
been in solitary confinement for about 8 months*
TESSMAN then put in the cell a Frenchman by the name
of MAURICE ETTINGHAUSEN alias SAXE* who was alleged
to be working for the French delegation for the
French civilian workers* He was an eminent author
and spoke English without accent* By telling me his
own story and giving me details of the illegal work
he had done in GERMANY* he gradually drew from me
details of my activities and the names of my helpers*
One day he was taken out of the cell to interview
TESSMAN* He came back rather excited and told me
that his boss had procured permission for him to leave
the prison and return to his office under escort and
word of honour to complete some work which only he
could do* Twice a week he was called for* on each
occasion he volunteered to take out letters to various
people in which I had asked for a rope and a file*
which he promised to bring the next tirae he went out*
Both rope and file were delivered to me in due course*
As X had written five letters I do not know who sent
them* I since learned that the rope and file were
sent by TESSMAN*
In the course of the next few nights I started
filing on one of the bars* Three nights before I
intended to be ready to go* one of the bars had been
filed through at one end, the light was suddenly
turned on at about 9,0*p*m* TESSMAN and REINHARD
rushed into the cell* discovered the filed bar* and
ETTINGHAUSEN was removed by an S»S* man* The cell
was searched and another letter found in which X
confirmed receipt of the instruments and advised my
friends of my intended escape*
I was then beaten up both by TESSMAN and REINHARD
with their fists and boots in such a manner that I
became unconscious* When I came to I was picked up
from the floor and beaten once more by TESSMAN with
fists and boots again so that I involuntary passed
water and motion* By the blows of TESSMAN my second
incisor tooth was split* and my right typpanic membrane
ruptured* I bleed profusely from a wound over the left
eye* As a medical man I would describe the treatment
as brutal, I still carry scars as the result of such
treatment,{verified}*
I was then taken from my cell on the third floor
and placed outside TESSMAN*S office on the ground
floor with my face to the wall* I wore nothing but
a shirt and it was the middle of winter, 3.3*44* the
snow was on the ground* I was left standing for
£ hours whilst TESSMAN and REINHARD* STANCE and
REINHARD*S Secretary Mrs SGHMI3T ( since committed
suicide) engaged in a drinking bout* Whenever STANCE
came out of the office on his way to the lavatory*
he bumped my head against the wall from behind*
At about ll*30®p«m* I was taken to the cellar
and placed in a cell which was the only one of its
kind in the prison® It was a dungeon* The next day
i was given a torn blanket* a pair of trousers* a
jacket and a pair of shoes* my hands were handcuffed
ejiiind my back and two heavy rings connected by a *».»﻿jJJ
»/ciiain were placed on my ankles* As j was unable to
' bring my hands to the front of my body I had t&
discharge my urine in my clothes. After that my
hands were shackled in front of my body. The only
window* which was on a level with the ground was then
cemented up on TESSMMf’S order, leaving an aperture
of about 6W x 6” inches and an iron grid, placed into
that. There was no bed or mattress, only a sort of
wooden bench* the w/c consisted of a bucked in a wooden
casing, TESSMAN. frequently visited me in this cell
and told me that this was my last stage, I would never
leave this cell alive, I was frequently visited by
REXNHAED and his secretary Mrs SCHMIDT and occasionally
beaten by fists, I was once punched by TESSMAN - again
using the pass keys - that I fell to the floor, I was
put on a diet of 350gr of bread per day and about
2 pints of coffee substitute. Every fourth day, I
received a warm meal. The cell was kept in complete
darkness except when food was dished out, or my bucket
removed, TESSMAN took great pride in exhibiting me
to all distinguished Nazi visitors of the prison, I
was shown to Obergruppen Fuheur PQHL and Jugendfuheur
PAULI who was attended by a staff of about eight
people including women. In the beginning they shaved
and bathed me once a week, and afterwards they left
me.
After I had been in this cell for about 40 or
50 days, I discovered a short piece of pencil about
§ an inch in the seam of my trousers, apparently
concealed there by the person who had previously worn
the trousers. With the pencil I wrote two notes
on strips of newspaper begging the finder to inform
my parents in South Africa that I was being slowly
murdered, I placed these notes in a grating which ran
at the top of the ceiling hoping they would be
discovered, I cannot say of they were discovered,
possibly they are there still,
I was taken out once after about 54 days and a
protocol of my intended flight was taken or made. It
was then that REINHARD showed me the photo-copies of
the five letters I had sent out through ETTINGHAUSEN,
I was then in such a state of physical and
mental weakness that I fell into a crying fit and
begged REINHARD to take me out of the dungeon, I was
told by REINHARD that he had no say in the matter,
this being entirely in the hands of TESSMAN and on
his orders.
During the 64 days I spent in this dungeon I
received a lot of mental torture by the S,S»man DEL
who would enter my cell and tell me that darkness
and the active mind of an intelligent person would
eventually result in madness*
One day when a fellow prisoner who helped in
dishing out the food suggested to give me a little
extra as there was ample, QEL said no, the sooner that
swine starves the better.
After 64 days I was removed in a dying state
and transferred to the "B" block, there I was again
put in solitary confinement but was not given any
erercise. While in the ’♦’B" block the S»S,man
LEITZBAGH helped me by giving me more than was my
normal share of food® I would like to mention this
in justice to him* I am prepared to say that this
extra food saved my life because I was dying,
I know of the Gestapo man ROETTGER, but I know
nothing in his favour or against him,
I also know Dr SGHNAPFAUF* he was the S,S.doctor,
I appeared before him twice for medical treatment,
but received no treatment at all, although I told him
I was a medical practitioner myself® This is all I
him*﻿In regard to the treatment of other Alied prisoners
I would point out that I was most of the time in
solitary confinement, and did not come in contact with
them at all, I only know of one case of a young
Hollander ( name not known): in the cell next to mine
who died unattended as the result of lice home typhus.
During the early part of June 1944, I was sent
to the Concentration Camp at HEUEHQAIME and there met
a number of leading Frenchmen who knew MAURICE
ETTIMGHAUSEH, They informed me that he was a well
known author and art eritie writing under the name
SAXE and had worked for the Gestapo in France and
in Germany erer since the German occupation began, and
that he was responsible for the death of hundreds of
his countrymen.

1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a lat^r stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(а)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(б)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.

With reference to these office minutes of even number dated
17th May 47 and 12 Jun 47, enclosing the cases known as FUHLSBUETTEL
Part I and Part II respectively.
1.	A further report in this case is submitted together with
depositions which it is suggested should be read, in conjuction with
the two earlier reports.
2.	In paragraph 6 of the minute of this Group to you dated
12 Jun 47, it was indicated that case III would deal with the
evacuation of transports of Allied prisoners from FUHLSBUETTEL
Prison to the camp at KIEL-HAASE but it now appears that only a
small part of the depositions now enclosed deal with that subject
and these could be more suitably added to the depositions in the
FUHLSBUETTEL Part I case dealing with that subject .
3.	There are now submitted 14 depositions on which the
comments of this Group are as follows:-
Deposition No. 1 by the accused TESSMANN does not seem
to carry the case any further except inso far as it
shows that TE^MANN who is un accused in Case Part I
knew that	the prisoners in FUHLSBUETTEL were held
after due process^**.
Deposition No._2 by Maria RAGMANN does not carry the case
any further except insofar as it shows PANNEK was acting
as an informer for the Gestapo; his case has been handed
over to Legal Division as the main victims of his
denunciations seem to be Germans.
Deposition No. 5 by Ursula PRUESSMANN carries the case
no further as it seems to show that the accused UKUMS
and LIETZOW mal-treated German nationals.
Deposition No. 4 by Ursula PRUESSMANN is of no assistance.
Deposition No. 5 by Hans SCHWARZ merely gives rather
conclusive evidence as to the incidents in FUHLSBUETTEL
Case Part I and of people in NEUENGAMME who had been
sent from FUHLSBUETTEL on transports by HELMS and TESSMANN
as to which it is thought it will be difficult to prove
what was at stake in the transports.
Deposition No. 6 by the Gestapo informer PANNEK and
describes the methods of torture used by the accused
HELMS which is not satisfactory evidence against HELMS
insofar as his treatment of Allied nationals is concerned.
Deposition No. 7 by Karl SCHULTZ insofar as it shows
evidence against the accused HELMS and LIETZOW and their
- cont -﻿2 -
4
it is
use of torture is again a case of German victims and.
the evidence of any mal-treatment of Allied nationals
is again hearsay. There has been no success in
the endeavour to trace Andre BAPTISTE and Jup LUVE as
referred to in this deposition. Without their evidence,
thought that the allegations could not be supported.
The only use for the deposition that this Group sees
is insofar as there is evidence against the accused
HENNINGS 453 W£the evacuation march from FUHLSBUETTEL
to KIEL-HAASE which is in Case No. I.
Deposition No. 8 by Max KRISTELLER is again evidence
of gross brutality by HELMS and BOCKELMANN against German
nationals but there is no particular evidence of any
particular tortures being practised against Allied
nationals .
Deposition No. 9 by a Dutch national Franciscus WIJDBKQP
indicates that he was mal-treated by HELMS but in the
light of other evidence as to what he has done, his (HELMS)
conduct in this case seems to have been comparatively mild.
Deposition No. 10 by Carla PARDSCHKE makes general
allegations against HELMS on mal-treatment against Allied
nationals but seems to be too vague to be of use.
Deposition No. 11 by HELMS in which he himself admits
he has taken part in the shooting of Russians at
executions but it would appear to be rash to prosecute
him on that admission alone.
Deposition No. 15 is a confirmatory deposition by HELMS
as to his preparation of shooting Russians.
Deposition No. 14 by BOCKELMANN seems to be of no use
and similarly deposition No. 15 by the accused LIETZOW.
4.	In the main, the report now enclosed seems to be of
singularly little use but it is sent for completion in order
that it may be read in connection with FUHLSBUETTEL Part I
and Part II.
5.	It is suggested that those members of the HAMBURG Gestapo
against whom we hold evidence of mal-treatment or killing of
German nationals should be handed over to Legal Division of
Control Commission who have already made certain investigations
about HAMBURG Gestapo and its treatment of German nationals
during the war.
6.	Insofar as throughout the FUHLSBUETTEL Case allegations
of denunciations by Gestapo spies, and in particular PANNEK,
have been made, th Is #i* considered to be outside the scope
of war crimes as the denunciations of resistance members by
Germans is a proper function. Insofar as PANNEK, in particular^
worked with the Gestapo, there is some evidence that he knew
their practices and brutal methods. He has been offered to
Legal Division with members of the HAMBURG Gestapo.
7.	It is suggested for your consideration that HELMS,
BOKELMANN and LIETZOW might all be offered to Legal Division
as the present report does not show sufficient evidence of a
prima facie case against them for presentation before a military
court.

With reference to the minute of this Group of even number
dated 17 May 47 and further to our minute of even number dated
4 Jun 47.
1.	It will be remembered that, in the earlier minute above
quoted, a report and depositions were submitted to you dealing
with the leading personalities of the staff of FUHLSBUETTEL
Prison, including HSS&PF Graf von BASSEWITZ-BEHR.
2.	There are now enclosed the report and depositions on the
general conditions prevailing in FUHLSBUETTEL Prison together
with the evidence of mal-treatment by the junior members of
the staff of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison whose names are listed above.
3.	It is suggested that the report and depositions now enclosed
be read together with the report and depositions already in your
possession.
4.	In general, it may be said that the names listed in the
report submitted to you on the 17 May 47 are those of the
outstanding personalities who ran the prison from outside; also
the Commandant and senior members of his staff; also some of
the outstandingly cruel women wardresses.
5.	The people whose names are set out in the list above are
all rank and file members of the prison staff; therefore, the
two cases dove-tail together and it is suggested they should be
considered together wiW^Tnb final advice is being prepared.
6.	It should also be pointed out at this stage that there is
a further report and depositions in the course of preparation
which deals with that part of the case known as the evacuation
of transports of Allied prisoners from FUHLSBUETTEL prison to the
camp at KIEL-HAAS3E on which	transports, various members
of the staff of FUHLSBUETTEL prison distringuished themselves
by their brutalities.
7.	It might be convenient if all three reports are considered
by you at one time as ratifications of this case are exceptional
and it will be a tacticai question to decide the best way to
present this case.
8.	Isofar as the case now submitted to you is concerned, the
following observations are made : There is, it is thought, a
/substantial﻿2
^^stantia^body of evidence against each of the accused listed
who appear to have mal-treated the Allied nationals in
a persistent and brutal way. The whole purpose of FO'HLSBUETTEL
prison was to soften people up prior to their interrogation by
the HAMBURG Gestapo. When a prison	....	- ■	™—""UETTEL,
there would normally accompany them
instructions from the Gestapo as to the type of treaahent the
prisoners should have and these instructions were carried out to
the end, sometimes being exceeded by the prison staff at
FUHLSBUETTEL. Apart from that, there was a systexa of punishments
and beatings in force at FLHLSBUETTEL which seem to have been
inspired by the initiative of the prison staff themselves without
any instructions from HAMBURG Gestapo.
9.	The normal case of brutality is that of beating and the
habit of standing prisoners for long periods with their face
to the wall and from time to time violently banging their face
against the wall until they were quite seriously injured in some
cases.
10.	With regard to the activities of the accused Paul REPPIN
and Kurt HERMANN, it will be observed that they are both
described as "transportfuehrers" and their task was to take
prisoners backwards and forwards to the interrogating office^
at HAMBURG. Mlal-treatment on these journeys, both in loading
and unloading the prisoners, seems to have been a regular habit
it must be born in mind that a great deal of evidence against
REPPIN' and HERMANN seems to be that which took place at the°
interrogation centre at HAMBURG in the Town Hall and not in
FUHLSBUETTEL Prison, particularly those allegations that occur
in the Hall of Mirrors in the Town Hall; therefore, it is
suggested that there may have to be a separate charge to cover
the activities of transport leaders outside FUHLSBUETTEL prison.
11.	With regard to the medical orderly MAU who is mentioned in
the report and depositions, it will be observed that he has been
omitted from the list of accused at the head of this minute.
'xhe^ reason ior this is that, although some witnesses speak as
to his neglect, there is one witness whose evidence will be
important, namely Dr. Rudolf DEGKWITZ (Deposition No. 8, page 2).
As this witness was a prisoner and a member of the medical
profession and speaks very well of MAU and to the detriment of
the accused Dr. SCHNAPPAUF, the medical officer, it is thought
that a court would pay some regard to such a testimony and
would give MU the benefit of the doubt. Accordingly, it is
3uSSested that MAU is oi more use as a prosecution witness to
bear out the conduct of4criminal character and the carelessness
** Dr. SCHNAPPAUF throughout his duties.
12. With regard to the rest of the accused, there is almost a
surplus of evidence of beating, both by men and women guards.
-lo . A great deal of the depositions and considerable parts of
other^depositions in this case would appear to produce evidence
that is not against the accused who are listed at the head of
tnis minute but deals with people who were listed as accused
in the first report submitted to you on the 17 May which, a^ain
is another reason for treating all these reports as part of°one
case.
the ceils, the exercises, the bedding, the laundry and other*
administrative matters which were all conducted in accordance
with the policy of softening-up the prisoners for Gestapo
interrogation.	H
15. It seems that it would be difficult to use these depositions
ft Q I i V\ rr tut 4 4- "H.   -»	_ _ _	~
dealing with general conditions
against the accused listed at the
/ top .......................﻿3
(op of this minute, unless one is going to charge them specifically
Ith being instrumental in setting up the general conditions
hd, in that event, they are quite certainly going to blame
the senior members of the staff and Gestapo officials outside
the prison who are not amongst the accused listed at the head
of this minute; thereby a great deal of force of the evidence
of general conditions will be lost. The only other way in which
the evidence of the general conditions appear to be relevant
against the present accused is insofar as it is the background
of the physical condition of each Allied victim who was beaten
or mal-treated by these accused, thereby making assault more
serious in each case: but this is not a very profitable way
of using the evidence of the general conditions.
16. There has been a certain sharpness on the part of judge
advocates when dealing with these cases oh, matters olF general
conditions:	they tend to hold that it is irrelevant^in large
part as there is not normally a charge before the court dealing
expressly with general conditions. A charge of mal-treatment
of Allied nationals does not, in the minds of some judge
advocates, embrace the conditions in which the Allied nationals
lived at the time they were mal-treated.
17. It also follows that, if the accused in the first case
submitted to you on the 17 May be senior members of the staff
and charged with general conditions, they will, of course, blame
the junior members of the staff and say that they never knew
these things went on. In short, if one wishes to use the
evidence of general conditions, it seems that it will have to
be the subject of a special charge with representatives of all
members of the prison staff before the same court in order
that they may blame each other and the court can assess where
the responsibility really lay.
18. It will also be observed that a considerable number of the
witnesses are German nationals who were political prisoners
and, although their evidence is valuable as coming from German
sources, it will be observed that their own mal-treatment cannot
be the subject of any charges of mal-treatment. Similarly,
evidence of the "stool pigeon" system being in use does not seen?
relevant to war crimes charges.
19. There is some slight evidence of death resulting from some
of the mal-treatments by the accused REPPIN and HERMANN and
possibly these two men could be charged with killing as well as
21. It Is hoped to send the third report on FUHLSBUETTEL prison
within the next few days and then you will be able to assess
the whole case from the three reports and cast your advise minute
accordingly.

Mai-treatment of Allied nationals in Gestapo prison
SHORT RESUiE OP INCIDENT
5 .
During the period of the war. Allied prisoners suspected
of political crimes were housed in RJHLSBUETTEL Prison where
sentences were served and these prisoners were held at the
disposal of the Gestapo for interrogation. Consistent
beatings, mal-treatments and floggings took place as part of
the plan to soften up the prisoners prior to interrogation.

FUHLSBUETTEL Pris
Graf von BASSEWITZ-
With reference to this Group's minute of even number dated
17 May 47.
1.	Further depositions are now enclosed relating to the case
submitted to you with our a/q minute.
2.	These depositions are by the following witnesses :
(a)	Stanislaus BARGLINSKI
(b)	Heinrich Juergen LUETJE 5
(c)	Elise GETTING ^
(d)	Karl HOEPPNER ^
(e)	Gottlieb PHILIPPZCYK ^
3.	These depositions in German, with English translations are
of particular importance in relation to the evacuation march from
FUHLSBUETTEL to KIEL-HAASE and implicate in particular the two
accused referred to in our a/q minute, namely Wilhelm HENNINGS
AND Johann HAHN. These depositions relate to Case (IV)as set
out in our a/q minute.
4.	There are also enclosed the following pfoo-fre-cHgat documents
with accompanying affidavits verifying the authenticity of the
photostats
(a)	Secret 01 Monitor dated 20 Jan 45. This document
is marked 'Z' and is supported by an affidavit by Major
LENIEWSKI dated 3 Jun 47. Your attention is invited
in particular to paragraph 15 which is an order from the
Reichfuehrer SS granting special powers of responsibility
in relation to concentration camps to Hoehere SS und
Polizeifuehrers. It is suggested that this document
is relevant as it shows an order from which BASSEWITZ-BEHR
can be assumed to have taken over control of the concen-
tration camps in his area and somewhat negatives his
statements that he was merely liaison officer between
the Party and the Police; and that he had very little
rights in relation to concentration camps.
(b)	Photostat copy of telegram sent by BASSEWITZ-BEHR to
the Chief of the 0RP0 in Leriin j.n which BASSEWI TZ-BEHR
reports successful operations against partisans in Russia.
This document is in the form of a telegram signed by
BASSEWITZ-BEHR. A certified translation is attached
to the photostat. rfhis document may be useful for
cross-examination against BASSEWITZ-BEHR in so far as
he has said in his statement that there were no partisan
movements or skirmishes and that relations with the
civilian population in Russia were cordial.
(c)	Photostat copy of a letter dated 1 Dec 41 from BASSEWITZ-
BEHR to the Personnel Department of the SS Administration
indicating that he has left the evangelical church from
Nov 41. It will be born in mind that BASSEWITZ-BEHR has
stated in his deposition that he has always adhered to
the Evangelical faith and has never left the Church.
cont﻿2
This document may prove to be useful in cross-examination.
(d)	Photostat copy of a letter from BASSEWITZ-BEHR to
Reichsfuehrer 53 thanking him for congratulations on his
promotion to Brigadefuehrer in the SS. A certified
translation is attached to the photostat.
(e)	A photostat testimony from Gruppenfuehrer LORENZ on the
subject of the S3 qusLities of BASSEWITZ-BEHR. This document
may be of use during cross-examination of BASSEWITZ-BEHR in
so far as he will endeavour to say that he was a secret
saboteur of the Hitlerite Movement. There is also
attached to this document the photostat of the Service
record in the SS records of BASSEWITZ-BEHR which is
included for the sake of completion of his SS history.
5.	It is thought that all these enclosures will be useful either
as direct evidence or for the purpose of cross-examination.
6.	It is anticipated that within the course of the next few days
the next case of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison will be submitted to you
under the heading "FUHLSBUETTEL II" which deals with the generi.
conditions in the Prison.

The relevant report and depositions in this case are
enclosed for your consideration and final advice to the Army
Commander.
1.	The case of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison shows certain similarities
with the general features of a concentration camp. It was guarded
by the SS, i.e. male SS belonging to the TV and female S3 referred
to as Aufeeherinnen. Since 1935, the prison was used for prisoners
sent there not by the Police or other state authorities, but
exclusively by the Gestapo. The purpose of the prison was to
serve as an interrogation centre and. the general "softening-up11
process of the prisoners, who were despatched to different concentration
camps or workers' education camps from FUHLSBUETTEL, some .of them,
as shown below, being despatched directly to be executed.
2.	The general conditions, i.e. over-crowding in the cells,
under-nourishment and beating as a general routine, equalled those
well-known by now as'up to .concentration camp standards. The
chain-of-command can be set out as follows : The accused General
von BASSEWITZ-BEHR was the H3SPF (the General-in~charge of the
Police*SS Forces within the Wehrkreis X). As such, he was
directly responsible to HIMMLER for Police and SS matters within
his Command. On the 17 June 1944, an order was issued by HIMMLER
in which the HSSPFfwere made responsible for the military security
of all concentration camps and. prisons containing political
prisoners in case of an enemy advance into his Command. These
powers were increased by a decree dated 1 October 1944 when the
HSSPF was also made the GOG of all prisoners of war in the
Yi/ehrkreis. Under his orders came the Officer-in-charge of
FUHLSBUETTEL Prison - the accused TESSMANN - and his second-in-
command - the accused STANGE.
3.	The other accused were warders and wardresses in FUHLSBUETTEL
Brison, the only exception being the accused. HOFER who was the
Managing Director of the NOLEIKO Factory and. he is not connected
with the FUHLSBUETTEL Prison other than as set out in Case No. III.
According to TESSMANN's own admission, none of the inmates of
FUHLSBUETTEL Prison had ever been tried by a court of law and
at H.Q. B.A .O.R.

4.	The Officer-in-charge of the investigation of this case
was advised to present this case a s a series of independent
incidents of murder and ill-treatment. The only connections
between these cases are :-
(a)	that some of the accused figure in several cases
and (b)	that the scene of the crimes is either PDHLSBI3ETTEL
Prison itself or a place to which the inmates of that prison
were taken for execution.
The general conditions prevailing in the prison were completely
disregarded for the purpose of thfis* cases.
5.	You may think that this case could best be tried as a
series of independent cases to be tried consecutively by the
same court. This would entail the grouping, of the cases in
the following manner
(I) The murder of 71 prisoners of BTJHLSBbETTEL Prison
at NEtlENGAMME Concentration Camp on 2l|/23. Apr 45.
(II) The shooting of 11 Russian male prisoners at
EIDELSTEDT QUARRY in Peb or Mar 44.
(Ill) The shooting of 5 Russian female prisoners of
FiJHLSBUETTEL Prison, prisoners of war, at the
Public Gardens in EIDELSTEDT on 14 Nov 43.
(IV) The murder'of several Allied nationals on the march
from FUHLSBUETTEL to KIEL in Apr 45.
(V) The case against General von BASSEWITZ-BEHR for
setting-up an interrogation eentre for Allied,
prisoners of war (officers) who had escaped and
been re-captured.
(General von BASSEVt/ITZ-BEHR is also implicated as
giving the orders for the executions in cases I and.
Ill above)

Murder of 71 prisoners of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison'at

The exact chain of command and the channels
through which the orders given to the HS8PF by HIMMLER
passed until they were eventually carried out in
NEUENGAMME has not been established with absolute
certainty as some of the material witnesses are no longer
alive, and. some are not' in custody; but the following
facts appear to emerge quite clearly from the depositions
(a) The order that no political prisoners should fall
3/ Into .
© • •﻿- 3 -
' HIMMLER to General von BASSEMITZ-BEHR who was
made responsible as HSSPF for its execution
(see depositions of General' von BASSEWITZ-BEHR).
(b)	Towards the end of March or banning of April 1945,
The HAMBURG Gestapo received ordered from Higher
Authority to prepare special lists of prisoners
in connection with the evacuation of EtlHLSBUETTEL
Prison. (Although it is likely that these orders
to the HAMBURG Gestapo emanated from BAS3EWITZ-BEHR,
this cannot be established with certainty - see
deposition of TESSMANN).
(c)	In accordance with these orders, three different
lists were prepared containing the total strength
of the prisoners held in' FUHLSBUETTEL Jail. For
this purpose, the prisoners were put into three
categories :
(i) the unimportant ones who were to be
released.
(ii) those virho were to be evacuated to KIEL.
(ii|) the most important ones who were to be
kept at FUHLSBUETTEL and then sent to
HEUEHGAMME for liquidation (see depositions
of WICHMANN, BOCKELMANN and others).
(d) It is alleged that the Commandant TESSM.NN and the
accused BI3MARK, BURMEISTER, BORGEMEHN and BLAUBACH
(wardresses) co-operated in compiling these lists
and-added names to them individually (see depositions
Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
[t)	Those 71 persons whose names figured on the list
described aboVe as group (c) i.e. to be taken to
NEUENGAMME to be exterminated, were despatched from
FUHLSBUETTEL on 21 April 1945 on an order received by
TESSMANN which said "by order of the HSSPF Graf von
BASSEWITZ-BEHR". These prisoners were taken to
If' The prisoners were eventually killed by a party
of/SS men led by the Lagerfuehrer Anton TUMANN (sentenced
to death in the NEUENGAMME Trial ancL,executgxl) by throwing
hand-grenades through the bunker where’TTfe ^n-isoners
were to be hanged - a measure i/hich was prompted by the
fact that one of the prisoners to be hanged had resisted
(see Depositions No. 2, 3, 4 and 5).
The fact that a substantial proportion of these
71 prisoners were Allied nationals seems to be established
by the witnesses WICHMANN (Deposition No. 11), SCHWARZ
(Deposition No. 2), HAENDLER (Deposition No. 4) and.
MEYER-PLOGK (Deposition No. 19).
The responsibility of General von BASSEWITZ-BEHR
who admits to having been aware of HIMMLER'S order and
of TESSMANN to whom he communicated this order, appears
to be clear. The responsibility of the accused wardresses
(BISMARK, BORGEMLHN, BLAUBACH and BURMEISTER) however
seems to be open to some doubt. The evidence against
them is based entirely on the Depositions No. 15,
16, 17 and 18 (the evidence of witnesses MUELLER,
Deposition No. 5 is third-hand hearsay and can hardly
carry any weight). The evidence given by these
4/ witnesses﻿
4
witnesses (in Depositions 15 - 18) is mainly based
on the remarks made by the accused to take the deponent
off one of the lists and put her on to another and this
can hardly be conclusive. It is to be pointed out in
this connection that, should you decide not to charge
the four wardresses with being concerned in the murder
of the 71 prisoners, each one of them will still have
to face charges of individual ill-treatment as set out
below.
CASE (II)
Shooting of 11 Russian male prisoners at the beginning
of March 1944.
The Commandant of RIHLSBTjETTEL Prison - TESSMANN
ordered a convoy of 11 Russian prisoners to leave
FUHLSBXJETTEL Jail for EIDELSTEDT where they were to be
executed by a firing squad. TESSMANN admits that they
were Russians. He also admits that they had never been
tried by a court of law and the crime they were alleged
to have committed was "looting". TESSMANN selected
the guards specially for 'that shooting party, excluding
one man because he vims not "strong enough". Vlfhat this,
phrase means in this context can be seen clearly by
the Deposition of the accused SCHULZKE (No. 70) who,
according to his own statement, got a bit nervous, fired
high, was told to stand aside and. was no longer "allowed"
to continue firing.
The participation of the following accused seems
clear : TESSMANN ordered the convoy (as Commandant of
the prison).
STANG-E accompanied the convoy to the place of
execution.
- SGHULZKE participated in the firing.
SCHUETTE led the prisoners in bunches of three
to the place of execution but
does not appear to have part-
icipated in the firing himself.
CASE (III)
Shooting of 5 Russian female prisoners at the Public
Gardens in EIDELSTEDT on 14 Nov 43.
The N0LEIK0 Factory in HAMBURG employed a large
number of foreign slave workers, amongst them being 50
Russian women who were prisoners of war. The Manager
of this Factory - the accused HOFER - was aware of their
status as-they arrived in uniform (according to his own
admission).
On the 10 November 1943, one working party of
Russ’ian girls complained about their rations and said
that they would continue to work only If they were given
better food. That this refusal fell far short of
mutiny can be seen from the Deposition of the witness
OELLRlcH (No. 23) who persuaded her working party to
carry on without resorting to violence. The accused
HOFER however called in the Gestapo who proceeded to
man-handle the Russian girls in an air-raid shelter.
After what they called an interrogation, The Gestapo
picked out five of the girls - apparently at random
*as some of them were not members of the working party
who had refused to work* - to be shot (see Deposition s
of MOGGE No. 21 and PAGELS No. 22).
On the 14 November 1943, the 5 Russian girls
were taken from FUHLSBUETTEL Prison to the Public
5/ Gardens .....﻿- 5 -
Gardens at EIDELSTEDT by iTESSMM and STANGE (Depositions
of TESSMANH, STANGE and witness MU No. 45). The
accused HOFER had ordered all the remaining Russian
female POWs to be brought to the Public Gardens to
attend the execution, obviously as a deterrent for further
refusals to work. The five girls were dragged on -to
prepared mats where they were murdered by being shotf
through the back of the neck (Depositions of witness
MAU No . 45).
The order for this shooting was supposed to
have been given by General von BASSEWITZ-BEHR (see
Depositions of witness OELLRICH No. S3 and accused HOFER
No .75). The responsibility of 'HOFER as the Manager
of the Factory who was well aware of the fact that the
Russian girls were POWs, appears to be clear and so is
the responsibility of TESSMANN and STANGE.
The murder of several Allied nationals on the march
from FUHESBUrTTEL to KIEL in April 1945.____________
This incident refers to the group of prisoners
classed in Case (I), para (c), sub-para (ii), as those
inmates of P’UHLSBUETTEL Jail who were to be evacuated
to KIEL in a case of emergency. Only a small party were
taken to KIEL by boat whereas the others marched from
HAMBURG. The second-in-command of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison -
the accused STANGE - was In charge of all convoys which
he supervised on his motor bike. One of the columns
was commanded by the accused HENNINGS and the accused
HAHN was his second-in-command; another column was
commanded by the accused SOHUETTE.
From the start, the accused TEBSMANN despatched
these marching columns with totally insufficient rations,
totally insufficient clothing (some of the prisoners
had no shoes and developed sores of all kinds during
the march) and a great number of them were in a very poor
state of health (see depositions of SCBUETTE No 71 and
E1ALD No. 34). TESSMANN's orders were that all
stragglers who were unable to march or who tried to escape
were to be shot:	several prisoners were actually shot
on the march though the exact number of them does not appear
to havp been established. The first convoy hov/ever of
which the accused HENNINGS was in charge, arrived at KIEL
with eight prisoners short and the accused admits that
five of them were shot on the march, by the accused
HENNINGS, his second-in-command HAHN and other S3 guards
who are not accused, (see depositions No. 34, 35, 37, 38,
39, 40, 41 and 42).
The orders for- the second convoy were the same
as for the first and, in execution of that order, several
prisoners were shot In the second convoy. SCHUETTE
who was in charge of this convoy admits shooting at least
one himself. This prisoner was not trying, to escape
but was simply trying to stay behind because he was
unable to march (see deposition of SCHUETTE No. 71).
r
It appears from depositions No. 33 and 35 that
some of the stragglers were shot merely as a deterrent
to drive the other participants the march on to further
exertions .
/
The nationality of these victims of murder Is
given in the deposition of SCHUETTE(No. 71) in which
this accused gtadTtos that two of them v/ere Russian and
one was a Pole; also by exhibits 'O', 'p1, 'R* and 'S'
which purport to be death certificates of which one is
6/ referred. .......﻿6
CASE
referred to as a Russian and one as a Czech national.
The order of General von BASSEWTTZ BEHR to establish
an interrogation centre at FU'HLSBOETTEL for escapees
(Allied offiers who had escaped from PCM Camps)._____
The evidence in this case is based on the depositions
of the Criminal Police Official KRUEGER-THIEMER (No. 31
and 32), kqr the deposition of the Erench Lieutenant
Marcel LEE (No. 30) and partly on the admission of the
accused BASSEWITZ-BEHR.
. The gist of this order appears to be that escaped
POW Officers who were re-captured were not to be returned
to their POW Camps but were to be handed to the Gestapo
for special treatment. This order was a secret onegu—4

CASE (VI)	/	•
Cases of ill-treatment of Allied nationals by the accused
TESSMANN, 3 TANGE, etc, between 1959 and 1945________________
All these are cases of ill-treatment of varying
degrees through beatings administered by the accused
guards to the & inmates of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison. The
victims of all these cases were Allied nationals and end.
ill-treatment in question appears to be well established
by the depositions of several witnesses in each case,
exceptions being Case No. 9 where the detailed, deposition
of the witness MEYER-PLOCK appears to furnish sufficient
evidence, and Case No. 10 where there is also only one
deposition made by the Dutch witness, van EIJS. In
this case, as in the case of SCHUEKZE, this weakness
does not seem to seriously effect the case against these
accused as they are also the subject of other charges
(see above) .
-‘-he only other Incident of ill-treatment which
warrants special attention-is Case No. 4 - the ill-treatment
of Mr. J.H.R. GLUCK, a British subject from SOUTH AFRICA.
GLUCK's deposition is as good an affidavit as anybody
can hope for and, as GLUCK is a doctor, the descriptions
of the injuries he suffered are almost scientific; but
in spite of that, you may well have to take into
consideration whether he should be asked to come and give
evidence in person.
6.	In accordance with the facts set out above. It would appear
that two types of charges can be bought against the'accused in these
cases
a)	Committing a war crime in that he or she. In violation
of the laws and usages of war, ill-treated •X’; an# Allied
national#, inmate# of FUHLSBUETTEL Prison.
This applies to the cases grouped under CASE (VI).
b)	The accused (more than one) to be charsed with
committing a war crime in that they were ali(yffc/lr concerned
in the killing of several Allied nationals, Inmates of
FUHLSBUETTEL Prison.
This charge should apply to CASES (I), (II), (III)
and (V).
c)	A charge against General von BASSEWITZ-BEHR, viz,
committing a war crime in that he, in violation of the lasw
and usages of war, issued an order for prisoners of war
who had escaped from custody to be handed to the Gestapo

FUHLSBULTTEL Prison Case.
Vi/ith reference to your final advice minute MD/jag/FS/76/
187(4B) dated 2 Jul 47.
1.	Having regard to the length of the three trials in this
case and the number of accused and the locality of the events
charged, it would be advisable to hold this case in HAMBURG,in
the large court there.
2.	It is suggested that this be one of the first cases to
be prosecuted by civilian counsel from England.
3.	If this course is agreeable to you, the trial could be
arranged to begin after the long vacation has begun.
4.	Would you be good enough to forward your views on this
proposal and, if it is agreeable, the names of the judge advocate
and prosecuting counsel in due course.

Dear
26 July 1947
Confirming our recent telephone conversation, 1 am pleased
to hear that you are able to prosecute in the Fuhlsbuttel cases.
I enclose a copy of the final advice minute -which deals
with these three linked cases and also a copy of the prosecution
papers for all three cases. Arrangements have been made for
Puhlsbuttel One to start at Hamburg on 6 August 1947. It should,
I tnink, take twelve to fourteen days and we are hoping to arrange
for Fuhlsbuttel Two to follow immediately after it - that is not
before August 1947. It is agreed that yew should also carry
out the prosecution in this case’and that the prosecutor’s fee is
seven guineas per day.
It is not possible to make definite arrangements about the
trial of Puhlsbuttel Three which involves the trial of twenty-two
accused, but the intention is that this shall follow after the
trial of Fuhlsbuttel Two, that is it should start sarly in
September and will probably last fourteen to twenty-one days. I
hope .that you will be able to prosecute in this case also and as
soon as plans become a little more definite I will get in touch
with you again.
The Judge advocate on the first case is Sir Shirley
Worthington Evans. Arrangements have been made for you and the
Judge advocate to fly to Harriburg on Monday, 4 August 1947 and
a military permit will be obtained for you covering the whole of
the long vacation.
When you have had a look at the papers I tninfe it would be
helpful if you had a conference with Captain Smith who prepared

Dear
Office of:
The JUdge Advocate General,
6, Spring Gardens,
Oookspur Street,
LONDON, S.W.1.
28 July 1947
Since speaking to you on the telephone about the Puhlsbuttel
cases we have had to make a slight alteration because the War
Grimes Centre In Hamburg are not able to mount the trial of the
twenty-two accused while the trial of Stalag Luft III is in
progress. We have therefore arranged that another oxm of the
Fuhlsbuttel cases (Fuhlsbuttal One) shall start on August 6, 1947.
This involves three accused instead of twenty-two and is a more
important and a more interesting case than the one involving the
twenty-two. It should, I think, last ©bout a fortnight and 1
hope that you will undertake the trial of this ease in place of
the one about which I originally spoke about.
Arrangements have been made for you to travel to Hamburg
by air on 4 August 1947 and a military permit is being obtained.
I enclose a copy of the charges against the three accused
and also a copy of the evidence for the prosecution.

LONDON, 8.741.
SUBJECT: FUELSBUTTEL CASES 1, 2 and 3.
Reference your Advice Minute dated 2 Jul 47 and your Advice Minute dated 11 Jul 47*
1. After consultation with the Officer-in-Charge of the Team that conducted the
investigations in this case, it is thought that the calling of the three following
witnesses in person would strengthen the prosecution’s case in the respective trials.
As all three witnesses are in Hamburg and therefore easily procurable, you may want
to consider whether they should be called instead of their affidavits being read.
They are
(i) In the first trial Wilhelm WICHMAfW, FUHLSBUTTEL prison. His evidence is
considered of great importance in order to establish ftcchain of command
within the Gestapo and the various stages through which the orders for the
killing of the prisoners went.
(ii) la the second trial the Dutch subject KOOMEN, Hamburg Rothenbaumchausse 179.
He was himself badly ill-treated by the Commandant TESSMANN and in view of
the fact that the main witness as to the brutal ill-treatment Mr. GLUCK .
will not attend as he lives in South Africa, KOOMEN who can speak from
personal experience as to the brutality and the ill-treatment, may greatly
strengthen the prosecution’s case.
(iii) In the third trial Dr. Rudolf DAGHWITZ, Hamburg 23, Hageraau 5. As he is
1i*@ medical practitioner and has spent a long time at the camp, his evidence
as to the general conditions prevailing there is considered very valuable.
2. Another point on which your advice is sought is para 5 on page 2 of our letter
of even reference dated 20 June 47. In this para it is suggested that those members
of the Hamburg Gestapo against whom wear h«ld evidence of ill-treatment and killing
of German nationals should be handed to the Legal Div' ' of the Control Commission
who have already made certain investigations about theVGUfetapo and its ill-treatment
of German nationals ^	’ g the war, for inclusion in their case against several
leading members of theTGtestapo.
3. I® your Advice Minute to the Commander-in-Chief dated 2 July, you do not mention
this point and. it would be appreciated if you could advise us as to whether you approve
of this particular part of the case being handed over to the German Authorities through
the Legal Division of the Control Commission.

“ FUHLSi^nE?aai, II -
¥iith further reference to isy minute of even number of
26 July, 1947.
1.	Hie arrangements for this case have today been discussed
with Group Captain Scraerhough when he visited this office. It
is understood that Fuhlshuetiel II has been arranged to follow
Fuhlsbuettel I in Court Go. 2 at Hamburg and that it is ejected
that this will start about 20 August, 1947. The exact date
cannot of c curse be fixed with accuracy at this stage since it
depends on the length of time taken for the trial of the case
Puhlsbuettel I.
2.	Arrangements have been made for Mr* B. Garth Moore to act
as Judge Advocate for tfee trial of uhlsbuettel II. Mr. Moore
is travelling to ..bine Army on 2 August, 1947* and is acting as
Judge Advocate on various military law cases including trials
at Bielefeld on 12 and 15 August, 1947. ay the necessary
arrangements be made in due course for the accommodation of
Mr. Moore during the trial.
3.	Mr. F.W.I. Barnes uho is prosecuting in Abhlabuettel I
will also prosecute in Fuhlsbuettel II.

Dear
Confirming the arrangements made verbally yesterday,
as Judge Advocate for the trial of Puhlsbuettle II, As ment-
ioned to you, this has been arranged to take place in Hamburg
and to follow the trial of Fuhlsbuettei I which starts on 6
August, 1947. It is hoped that Puhlabuettel II will start
on 20 August, 1947# but it is not possible to fix the date
quite definitely at this stage, since it depends on the length
of time taken for the first case. As far as one can judge,
Fuhlabuettel II should take about 12 to 14 days to try. If
you find that Colonel Williams wishes you to act as Judge Ad-
vocate in other courts-martial which will interfere with the
war crimes case, you will doubtless ask him to get into touch
with this office so that the necessary alterations can be made.
I enclose herewith a copy of the charge sheet and a list
of the names of witnesses together with copies of "their rotate-
meats.

The FCTHLSBUETrSIh Prison Case
Reference your 5338/1 l/21/Lsgal dated 29 July 1947.
1. It is agreed that as both Wilhelm WLCHMm and EDCI» are residing
in ifeEhurg and as their' evidence is relatively short, that they should
be called to give evidence in person in the first and second cases
respectively instead of their affidavits being read®
2# X have reconsidered the statement of Dr* Rudolf DAGHUTZ but con**
aider that the evidence given therein is not in itself sufficiently
specific to justify either calling DAGIMTZ or producing the statement
under Regulation 8(i)(a). I notice, however, that you 'nave discussed
this question with the officer in charge of the team which conducted
the investigations in this case and it may well be that E&GuflfXlZ
a position to give further important relevant evidence beyond what is
contained in his statement of 6 January 1947. As this matter concerns
the third trial there will be sufficient time to prepare a further
statement by HAGHWITZ in the event of Ms being in a position to
supply further evidence. If it is decided to take a further statement
X will reconsider the question of whether he should be called or not
at the trial.
3. In W minute of even reference dated 29 July 1947/.1 confirmed
that those members of the Hamburg Gestapo against whom you possess
evidence of ill-treatment or killing of German nationals should be
banded over to the Legal Division of the Control Connissicn.

FUBLSBUETTEL PRISON CASES.
First and Seoond Cases
Th« first case lasted from ^th - 27th
August 1947, the second from let - 25th September, 1947.
■f
First Cag®.
Bassewitz-behr was found not guilty of the
fire4 three charges. Tesshann and Stange were found each
guilty of the first charge and sentenced to 7 and 5 years
imprisonment respectively.
There were very considerable difficulties in
the way of the prosecution against th© first defendant,
including th© following.
(a)	His exalted rank, and consequent remoteness from the
executants of the various orders passed down th©
hierarchy of the Police System:
(b)	The absence 0? any person stationed intermediately
between him find his co-defendants:
(c)	On the second charge, the fact that this was based
on the conclusions of a French investigation which
were not adequately supported by evidence.
(d)	On the third charge, the demise of both Max Pauly
and Anton Thuman, by .judicial execution in October
1946, and th© fact that evidence of an important
telephone-call alleged by Karl Totaauer to have
taken place between Bassewitz-Bshr and Pauly on
20th or 21st April 1945 was not included in th©
Affidavit taken from Pauly before his execution.
Unfortunately, Tot^auer had heard nothing of the
conversation while it was actually in progress.
However, efforts were made in collaboration
with th© Officer in Charge investigation. Major.J.Leniewskl
to fill these gaps (and others left open by the non-
availability of two witnesses recommended to be called in
person), by calling other witnesses, (after interview) from
th© lint of those whose affidavits were recommended to ' e •
submitted: as a result of this, and of the tactics of the
Defence in putting evidence of general character Into issue
and calling a large number of witnesses who on occasions
differed from the' defendant in matters of f et, I thought
that at the conclusion of the case th® first charge had
been put on its feet and th© third substantiated. The
Court thought othrwise. A very favourable testimonial
as to character by Count von Ehrensvaerd, former Chief of
the Swedish General Staff, may have had some influence
upon the result.
Of the second charge little need be said.
The Affidavit taken by the French Officer from the witness﻿
Krueger-TM©hex was hopelessly "optimistic"; investigation
shov/ed that the Allied Officers concerned were arrested in
Kiel in April, 1944 and mo t of them were dead in a few weeks
from that date; there was evidence that Baesewitz-Behr had
had nothing to do with prisoners of wax until after July, 1944*
the evidence of the disposal of the officers was uncertain,
except that two of them were probably shot on or about 9th
May, 1945* tbe French officer admitted in cross-examination
that his conclusions were based on no evidence other than that
already before the Court; this evidence included that of a
man called Praeger, a German prisoner of war in French hands,
whose (additional) affidavit was submitted to the Court.
After the acquittal of Bassewltz-Behr a
complaint was made to me by his counsel, Dr.Grimm, that he
was unable to trace his orient’a whereabouts but believed that
h® might have been extradited to th© Russian zone. 1 informed
him that I had no responsibility in these matters. I learned
afterwards that Bassewifa-Behr had in fact been extradited and
that no information had been given to him, his legal advisers
or his relatives until after the actual handing-over had
taken place (if at all). Though the matter is one clearly
outside the scope of this report, I do urge that the Control
Commission for Germany (British Element), upon whom I understand
responsibility for extradition i® now laid, should not make
such decisions behind closed doors, but that some hearing
comparable to that held under the Extradition lets, 1871-1932
in the United Kingdom should take place; the least that could
b© done would be to notify the person whose extradition i®
requested that the application ha® been mad© on certain grounds
to be specified, and invite him to submit any written
represent!ons he may wish to make in opposition to the
application. Secret extradition would appear to be inconsistent
with th© doctrines of personal liberty and rights which axe
being officially propagated; there seem# to be no adequate
safeguards against fabricated evidence or applications for
extradition based on improper (for example, political) grounds:
to the Germans' eyes, we must seem to be preaching "habeas
corpus" and practising "Schutzhaft" ("protective custody9')-
I am not suggesting that any injustice took
place in the case of Basaewltss-Behr, as I had in my possession
a photoetatic copy of a teleprinter message emanating from
him and reporting what must have been a massacre of Russian
partisans, which message he admitted sending when asked in
cross-examination. The remarks in paragraph o are made in
respect of the principle rather than the person involved.
The acquittal of B&ssewltz-Behr had a deplorable
effect upon public opinion in Hamburg, and it was widely
held, particularly in "left ing" cirdes, that the acquittal
had been arranged "behind the scenes • The creating of this
impression was facilitated by the conduct of the wife and
daughters of Baseewitz-Behr, who frequented the passages and
corridors of the building while the Court was temporarily
adjourned, and appeared to be on friendly terms with certain
military and Control Commission officers.
In retrospect, it stems that a mistake was
made in not including Bassswltz-Bahr in the main trial of
the staff of the Neuengamme Concentration Camp; or, at any﻿->
rat©, in not trying him before Pauly's execution; and in not
adequately "briefing" tbe officer who took Pauly's affidavit
concerning th© substance of the third charge.

In general, this was a v®xy satisfactory trial,
in which vjgdicta of guilty in respect of all defendant®
substantiaTTy^ana severe sentences followed an extremely "fair11
summing up by* the Judge Advocate.
Two political factors should b® mentioned
which affected the course of th© trial*
(a)	A sever© attack w&s launched by th® Defence on prosecution
witnesses who wear members of the "Committee of Former Political
Prisoners," In consequence of this, acting under my discretion,
I called more witnesses in person and read corresponding fewer
affidavits than had been originally recommended. Th® Committee
did give ground for complaint in its approach to th© Chairman
of an allotment colony in which the Schulzke family was
accommodated, suggesting,before th© conclusion of the trial,
th t this defendant was guilty and his family should b® evicted.
This matter was dealt with adequately by th© Judge Advocate in
hia summing-up,
(b)	Th© "Hamburger folksseitung" (Communist iKewspaper)
criticised the Court in two issues, committing undoubtedly what
would in this country have bean contempt of Court. Th©
attitude of those responsible is comprehensible in person©
ignorant of the principles of British criminal law,who "know*
or, irnagin© they know, more than can be proved in a Court of
Law. The verdicts and sentences in the second case should go
some distance in counter-acting the bad popular impression made
by the acquitted of Bassewitz-Behr; while the Intended
injustice to Schulzke's relations has clearly been thwarted by﻿-4^
his acquittal* I understand that Mr. Basil Hie Id is making
some representations to the appropriate authorities concerning
the lack of restraint and respect demonstrated by this
newspaper.
The acquittal# of all person© involved in the
second charge seem® to have been based on the doctrine of
“mens rea", the d©f®nc® being that great publicity had been
given in Germany to th© punishment of looters (convicted
under some summary procedure) by shooting, and that it was not
positively proved that the defendants concerned knew they
“were taking part in an illegal execution. Under the doctrine
that th© burden of proof never shift® (TToolrfilnr-ton v« Director
of Public Proaecutions and amendments to Chapter ?II page 116
of th© Manual of Militriry Law) th® verdict appears not
unreasonable.
Regarding th© sentences, th® sentence of death
on Tessm&m seams to b© courageous in that no oae® of "murder”
perpetrated by his own hands was charged nd proved against
him. Subject to th© mitigating fore© of the argument that he
was acting under superior orders, and taking a very wide view
of his activities over th© years preceding the Gorman
capitulation, th© sentence appear® to b® a just on®. It is
submitted that if Tesamann's sentence were to be commuted,
those passed on iknnlnga -and Schuette would also have to be
reduced.
Criticism was raised by th© Defence against th©
Staff Sergeant who took th© statements of Oehl and others of
th® Defendants. It appears that there may b© interrogators
practising under th© far Crimes Group who have little knowledge
of their function or of th© principles laid down by H.M,Judges
for th© guidance of Polio© Officers when taking statements from
persons suspected of crime. It is recommended that som©
instruction*should b© given to such interrogators covering th©
principles referred to and th© following points
(a)	The distinction between interrogating for th® purposes of
Intelligence and taking statements for production in a Court
of Law.
(b)	That denials given by defendants are not nec®S8arily
valu©le©s to th© prosecution in a subsequent trial.
(c)	That any "handle" given to th© defence by such practices
as bullying or inaccurate reporting of potential defendant® is
productive of great harm, both to the prosecution’s case and
to the reputation of th© whole organisation of "war crimes."
It i® further recommended that no interviews
with prosecution witnesses should take place on premises
associated with any political party or body: th© words
"political body" including associations of former political
prisoner®.
An extremely useful book of Routine Order® *
from th© Reiohseicherheitahauptamt (Berlin Head Office of the
Gestapo, Security Polio© and C.I.D) was put at my disposal
for some parts of th© first trial, thanks to th© coincidence
of that trial with the trial of those responsiblefor th©
killing of th© reapers from Stalag Luft III, Th® book,
I understand, was on© acquired by an investigating officer
on hi® own initiative from a former Gestapo office. It is
suggested that steps might b© taken to stscur® more copies
of book® or orders of this kind, which muet have been used﻿at th© trial of tha major war criminals at !Ture»iberg, and
are invaluable as ammunition for cross examination to any
prosecutor in a case in which th© Gestapo i© concerned.

FIELD INVESTIGATION SECTION
WAR cmiss GROUP (BTE)
PESAIvIBr.E:
PUHLSBRETTEL Prison situated in one of the Hcrtn, Hntiburg suburbs
was used under the Nazi Regime until the middle of 1935 as a Con-
centration Camp,, In the middle of 1935 a part of FUHLSBUETTEL prison
was transformed into a Polizeigefaengnis (police prison) and was
used exclusively by the Gestapo.
The prison Commandant until 1st of April 1943 was Obersturmfuehrer
SS RODE who was succeeded by Sturmscharfuehrer 3S WILLI TESSviAJJN.
The prison guards consisted of a certain number of/ SS other ranks
and female Aufseherinnen who also performed the duties of prison
wardens.
The main task of the prison was to "soften up" the prisoners and
prepare them for Gestapo interrogation.
No one of the prisoners kept in Fuhlsbuettel had appeared in front
of a court or was sentenced by a proper Court.
According to the Gestapo instructions the prisoners were either
kept in Fuhlsbuettel for further interrogation, sent to different
Concentration Camps or Arbeitserziehungslager (Labour Correction
Camps) for force labour or liquidation, or directly executed.
The general conditions and the strict discipline in the Fuhlsbuettel
prison were of the same well known standard as in the Concentration
Camps. The prisoners were ill-treated, badly beaten up, often de-
prived of their meager food rations, put in chains and dark cells.
This re. ort, however, is not dealing with the general conditions
prevailing in Fuhlsbuettel prison as in view of the fact that
nearly all members of Fuhlsbuettel staff have been located and
arrested it was decided to submit several reports In this case.
The general conditions will be dealt with in the next report
(Case Fuhlsbuettel II).
This report will only deal ?dth a small number of members of
Fuhlsbuettel staff implicated in mass executions carried out
mostly on order of the HS3PF Graf BASSEffITZ-BEHR and with mur-
ders committed during the evacuation of a part of the prisoners
from Fuhlsbuettel to Eiel-Hassee. Particular cases of ill-treat-
ment of Allied nationals committed by certain accused implicated
in the above mentioned cases will be also dealt with in this
report.﻿OclSG X
Murder of 58 men and 13 women, prisoners of FtlHLSBiETTEL Pile
on the 22nd and 2jrd of April 1945_______________________________^
In 1944 the Government of the German Reich issued-instructfi.©k
the Hoehere SS und Polizeifuehrer that in case of an Allied
sion into the German territory proper all the concentratic4| camg
prisoners, slave labourers and poYf's should be evacuated,, Jkn the
beginning of March 1945 .the HSSPP's received an order fromfelilO
that the Fuehrer makes them personally responsible that nsijps of
the Concentration camp inroates should fall into the hands‘if
enemy alive. (SASSEWITZ-ESHE, Deposition No. 6?). Several IfouW
rences took place betvreen HIMMLEH and BASSENITZ-HEHE conceMj;^
matter. Instructions concerning the evacuation of priscmerSSve*:
been partially already issued in the end of 1944, and the d&Sftr;	'
dants of prisons and camps were only waiting for special orders
to carry them out. Several degrees of emergency were laid down
in these instructions (TESSMAM Deposition No. |0)	-J
' '	j/'«|
In the end of March and in the beginning of April 1945 the dif-
ferent, branbhes of Hamburg Gestapo received orders from the higher
authorities to prepare special lists in connection with the eva-
cuation of the Fuhlsbuettel prison.
The. instructions when preparing the lists were as follows: A jfe.isfc-.
oj. unimportant prisoners to be released in case of emergency, a'no"
fart to be evacuated to a more saffer camp in Mel-Hassee, the ifjl,
important prisoners to be kept in Fuhlsbuettel and to be sent late
to NEUEHGAMME as it will be ffcpved further for liquidation. (Depend
of Jacob, Jichmann, Eggers, Heyenn, Bockelaann, No.'s 10, 11, 12. p
and 14). There is no doubt about it that^above mentioned Gestapo
officials prepared partially the list of Fuhlbuettel prisoners who
were murdered in HEIMTGAIME on the 22nd and 23rd April 1945, as .the
names of prisoners like Karl PACLiANN (Czech carpenter) or famous
Hanne MEBTENS mentioned by BOCKEUiAIOT and EGGERS are also given A
witnesses Hans SCHWARZ and Michael MOELLER, who were present in
HBOENGAMME, when the execution was carried out or by Frau ELOCE
who herself was imprisoned in Fushlsbuettel.
Among the 71 prisoners who vrere sent to NEUENGAMTS for liouidation
Wtr? ^ certain number of Allied Nationals. According to the Gestapo
official fICHMANN (Deposition No. 11) the number of non-German
prisoners was about 50. The fact that a certain number of Allied
nationals were executed among the 71 prisoners is confirmed by the
witness SCHWARZ, HAENDLER, MUELLER and ELOCK (Deposition No. 2,4, V
5, and 19). Frau FLOCK gives even some of the names of the executed ‘
Allied nationals both men and women.
According to the witnesses 1TTTST0CK, LUMMITZ, LIBERAM, RHODE and
FLOCK and MUELLER (Depositions No. 15,16.17,18, 19 and 5) the
Commandant of Fuhlsbuettel, TESSMAHN, and the Aufseherinnen BIS-
MARK, BUEtiCElSTEE, BORG-MEHN and HLAUBACH added names of certain
prisoners to the list prepared by the various Gestapo Departments.
It is significant that a part of the 13 women prisoners executed in
HEUEiTGAlvL.E were left behind in ELHLSBiEfTEL after the evacuation of
the prison on request of'Aufseherin BIS1ABK for the purpose "of
^keeping the house in order and doing personal work for the wardresses"
(BISLAEK's own admission to witness FLOCK).
TESSMANN in his deposition admits that j’lthe 71 persons executed in
KBGEH3AMMB have been kept in Fuhlsbuettel after the evacuation of
the prison and described thenftas the most important and dangerous
onef On the 21st of April 1945 TESSIALN received an order to pre-

passed to him by his 2 i/c, 3TANGE, T/ho states that he got it from
the Gestapo officials H1YMH or Y/ICHIiAOTT (actually it v/as WICHIvLCM)
and by siting out the movement order was instructed to insert the
following heading: "By order of the HSSPF Graf BAS "EWITZ-BSHR."
The prisoners concerned were loaded on 2 lorries and proceeded
under the command of STANGE to irEUETCAIdiE.
Vv
After the arrival of this transport KEGEriGAM.Ti the comnandant
of the Gamp Obersturmbannfuehrer FAULT refused to accept it, as
by that time an order of Amtsgruppe "D" existed closing KEUENGAM..E
for further transports in view of overcrowding.. As the officer in
charge of the transport insisted that he^aeissoh orders of HSSEP
BASSEiTITZ-EEHR. PAULY ordered his Adjutant TOTZAUER (Deposition
No. 8) to connect him by phone with BASSEWTTZ-BEHR. After the
conversation PAULY'said to TOTZAUER that B'SSETITZ-BEHR insisted
that the prisoners should be accepted and la&er executed (De-
position No. 8, TOTZAUER; Deposition of PAULY Exhibit "L").
The statements of PAULY andjT^TZAUER are fully corroborated by
the statement/ made by THUMMN (Exhibit^M'') NAEVE (Deposition
No 9) , JACOB (Deposition No. 10) WICHMANN (Deposition No. 11)
and EGGERi) (Deposition No. 12). In view of these statements it
cannot be doubted that an6rder closing NEUENGAMME for further
' transports of prisoners existed, that this order was issued by
y1 Amtsgruppe "D" (office of Gen. POHL) and that only BAS EWITZ-
BEHR as' HSSPP of the district had the power to change this
order.
WICHMAi® (Deposition No. 11) states further that he saw the lists of
Puhlsbuettel prisoners sent to NEUENGALii.E and that these lists were
signed by BAS LWiTZ-BSHR and Chief of Hamburg Gestapo BLQMBERG
On the 22nd of April 1945 BASSE1/,LTZ-BEHR gave personally an order
to Commandant PAULY to execute the ‘71 prisoners who arrived from
Fuhlsbuettel prison (Deposition of PAULY (Exhibit "L").
This order was carried out in the following manner. First the
women (12) with exception of one were hanged. One woman who hid
herself was later discovered and killed (Deposition of SIEVLRTSEN
No. 3).
The 58 men were brought into a bunker but when the SS-men concerned
wanted to 'shoot them, they defended themselves and even got hold of
a pistol. Anton THUM&NN who was in charge of the execution squad
ordered some hand-granades to be brought. The hand-granades were then
thrown inside the Bunker through this the windows, killing every-
body.
The circumstances of this horrible crime are described by witnesses
LUEDKE (Deposition No. 1), SCHWARZ (Deposition No. 2), SIEVEETSEN
^Deposition No. 3), HAENDLER (Deposition No. 4), and MUELLER
(Deposition No. 5;*﻿Ho. 2 Case, SHOOTIICt OF 11 RlCSIimS;
In the end of February or in the beginning of March 1944 TESStaAiFf in
his capacity of the Commandant of Fuhlsbuettel prison took a transport
of 11 Russian prisoners from Fuhlsbuettel to Eidelstedt. The following
guards among others accompanied TESSMAIOT - STANCE 2 i.c. of Fuhls-
buettel, SCHU1ZKE, SCHHBTTE, HAMMEL (not located) and SCHMDESER (wit-
ness in this case). Ify taking out the prisoners TBSSMAIffif knew that
the3r are going to be executed as he previously selected the guards whose
nerves in his o.-inion were strong enough to stand the execution (De-
position of SCHDLZKE No. 70). TESSMAIIN in his statement admits that
he knew that the 11 prisoners are going to be shot. He does not re-
member who gave the order for the shooting of prisoners. All he knows
is that the prisoners haw been ccvicerned in looting.
The prisoners have been brought to EIDELSTEDT and there shot in the
quarry, in the presence of about 200 people. The following members of
Fuhlsbuettel Staff took an activn part in the shooting: STANCE, SCHQLZKE,
and H&MMEL (not yet located).
The circumstances of the shooting are described in the Depositions of
SCHUETTE (Deposition No. 71), SCHMHESER (Deposition No. 20) and SCHULZKE
(Deposition No. 70).
SCHNLZEE (Deposition No. 70) .made a full confession about his part in
the shooting. SCHuETTE led the prisoners to the place of the execution.
No. 3 Case, SHOOTING OF 5 BUSSIAN WOMEN, PoW’s.
In Autumn 1943 the NOLSIKO Factory in HAMBURG employed a big number of
foreign -slave labourers. Among them was a Group of 30 Russian women,
Pol's, members of the Soviet Armed Forces. They arrived at the factory
in military uniforms (Admission of factory manager Ernst HOFER - De-
position No. 75).
On the 10th of November 1943 a part of the women concerned refused to
eat and to proceed to work as the food given to them ..as uneatable.
According to witnesses MOGGE and PAGELS (Deposition No.'s 21,22) the
food was really bad.
The manager of the factory,accused HOFER, arrived in the camp where
the female PoW’s were billeted, tasted the food, which in his opinion
'was not Well prepared and ordered the women to return to work. They
however, refused asking for better food, German money instead of
camp-money and permission to walk out freely as all the othek foreign
workers.
This was refused and director HOFER called the Gestapo (HOFER's own
admission).
After the arrival of Gestapo officials headed by the Kommissar SC1M2IK
the women concerned were locked up in a Bunker where they were inter-
rogated and partially beaten up /by the Gestapo officials. Director
HOFER was present.
After the interrogation five women Taisa SMIRNOVA, Sofija NINAJEWA,
Anna A..APOV/A, Maria EEEI/ilNOWA, Antonia KOSLOWA, were selected by the
Gestapo officials and taken away to Fuhlsbuettel prison. Qut of these
five ARAPOWA and SMIKNOWA were not concerned in this incident as they
had been on a different working shift. (Depositions of MOGGE and
PANELS, No. 21 and 22).
On the 14th November 1943 the five above mentioned women were taken
out from Fuhlsbuettel prison by TESSMAM, STANGE and a number of oth r﻿-S'-
t
guards to the Volkspark in EIDELSISHT* .
5	•	'	'
The other E ;ssian female PoW's were also brought there on order
of Director SOPER.
The five women brought from PUHLSBOETTEL prison were then shot
in presence of the others by the Gestapo officials. The shoot-
ing was done in the following manner: Tbs girls were placed on
the formerly prepared mats and disposed fcy G-enickschuss.
I
According to the statements made by witness. OELLSICH (Deposition
No. 23) and accused HOPER (Deposition No, 75) the order to shoot
the 5 Russian female P0Y7s was given by the- HSSPF, BASSllilTZ-BETIR.
The source of their information was G-estapo Koramissar SCKBEIM
who conducted the investigation in this case.
S6HK3H- explained in -f: on't . of several witnesses that he himself
wanted to send the vromen concerned to a Labour Conrection Camp
(Arbeitserziehungslager) OHt that his proposal was overruled by
BASSE/ITZ-BEHR, who ordered to shoot the girls in order to give
a deterrent example.
SGHWEIM as interned, but escaped before a statement could be
obtained from him.
It must be pointed out that the accused KOFER who informed, the
Gestapo about the unrest amongst his workers knew perfectly well
that the workers concerned were pop's, and he had previous ex-
perience/ of severe treatment by the Gestapo of Russian labourers
or Genpans who were trying to help, them (incident of TKACHENKO
and f^jlTHAELT, described in the deposition of Frau MCGCEB - No.
21 and REINHARDT, Wilhelm No. 25.).
No. 4 Case, ILL-TREATIEEKT OP BRITISH SUBJECT J.H.R. GLUCK
A British subject J. H. R. GLUCK was" studying medicine in Germany
in 1939* He ms a South African by birth. Before the outbreak
of the war he was advised by the consul to make his way to the
Danish border. He was, however, arrested and brought back to
HAMBURG. He was released thanks to the intervention of a German,
ex South African Consul General, and permitted to continue his
work in a hospital.
In August 1943 GLUCK who in the meantime contacted some Norve-
gians tried to leave Germany but was arrested and placed in
solitary confinement in Fuhlsbuettel prison. He was interrogated
by a Gestapo official, REINHARDT (committed suicide) and
severely ill-treated by him and the prison Commandant TESSEANT,
who continuusly assaulted him and beat him with three large pass
keyes hinged together, often drawing blood. This ill-treatment
took place at all times even when the victim was it/>ed at night.
After eight months of solitary confinement a Frenchman, who -was
working as an agent for TESSMAMN and Gestapo was put in GLUCK’s
cell. He promised GLUCK to help hirn to escape as he had per-
mission to leave the prison under escort to do certain important
job. After a few days the Frenchman returned with a rope and a
file for which GLUCK asked in several letters to his friends,
which the Frenchman offered to deliver. This rope and file were
sent■by TESSMAF®.
Nhen GLUCK succeeded to file through one of the bars in his cell
the light was suddenly turned on and TESSMANN and REINHARDT rushed
into the cell and proceeded to beat up GLUCK with their fists and﻿feet, he became unconcious, and as soon as he recovered he \ms
beaten up again in a most brutal manner. One of his teeth was
split and his right tympanic membran^ru, tured. He was then ta-
ken to TESSMAM-is office where he was severely ill-treated, by
STANGE. Later that night GL'OOK was taken to a dungeon	in
the cellar of the prison, his hands were hand-cuffed behind his
back and two heavy rings connected by a chain were placed on
his ankles. The only air which came into the cell came through
a slit of about 6x6 inches. In this cell GLUCK spent 64 days.
During this time he was severely ill-treated by TESSl.iAIli, E2IHHAED
and OEHL. After 64 days GLUCK was in a dying state, he was then send
to HEUEHGAldvlE Concentration Camp. During GLUCK1 s stay in the dungeon
he wrote three small notes giving his particulars and particulars
of the treatment he had received. He hid. the notes ina grating.
The notes were discovered by Capt. F.M. W.4BK3E, investigating
officer, and are attached to this report as Exhibit "N1*.
GLUCK is still carrying scars as result of the ill-treatment that
he received in FUHLSBUETTEL.
After sending GLUCK* to NEOEMGAKMB instructions have been issued
to finish him of there by employing him on extremely strenious
work. As it can be seen from the Deposition of witnesses LUEDEE
(Depos/ition No. 28) and LORD (Deposition No. 29), the Gestapo
continously inquired in NEUEMGAM-.iE how GLlCKWfcs employed and if
he was still alive.
GLUCK survived through lucky circumstances and returned to South
Africa after the liberation.
Case Ni.. 5, FUHLSBBETTS1 INTERROGATION CENTRE FOR ESCAPED ALLIED FOW’/
OFFICERS.
In October 1944 HIMMLER granted BASSEUTITZ-BEIIR and other HSSEFueh-
rers the powers of officers in charge of the prisoners of war in their
areas (BASoEWITZ-BEHR1s own admission). BA3SEW1TZ-BBHR issued then
an order that all officers PoW who escaped and had been re-captured
would be handed over to the Gestapo for special treatment. This
order was a secret one (Deposition No. 31 and 32 of KRUEGER THIIMER).
An interrogation centre for these officers was established in Fuhls-
buettel Prison.
t*
As it can ben seen from the Deposition of Lt Marcel LBB (Deposition
No. 30)5 ten French officers who went through this Interrogation
Centre later disappeared and it was later proved that they were sent
to MAUTHAUSEN Concentration Camp where they died.
Case.No. 6, MURDER OF SEVERAL ALLIED NATIONALS, DURING THE EVACUATION
MARCH FROM FU5HLSBUETTKL TO PEL HASSES.________________________________
Approximately on the 10th April 1945 the Commandant of FUHLSBUETTEL
Prison, TESSMANN received the order to start the evacuation of the
prisoners to the Concentration Camp at KIEL-KASS1E. A small party
of prisoners was sent to KIEL by boat, the majority had to march.
They were divided into several transports. The officer in
charge of all transports was STANGE who supervised the march of the
different transports on a motor-bike. One transport was led by the
accused HENUINGS, whose2 i/c was the accused HAHN, another transport was
led by the accused SCHUETTE.
The prisoners were sent on a four days' march in a veiy bad state
of health, with totally unsufficient rations, a great number of
prisoners was sent on the march without shoes. Before the trans-
ports left TESSMANN issued an order to the effect that all the
prisoners unable r;o march or trying to escape should be shot (De-﻿(4
* f|-
position No. 71 of SCHUETTE, No. 33 of MANJTSHAHDT and No. 34
of MUL'D). The accused HE 'TNGS admits in his deposition (No. 72)
that there ere 197 prisoners in his transport when he left
Fuhlsbuettel, he arrived in KIEL with 189 ofUiem. He admits
that 5 of them have been shot during the march.
The shooting was done by the accused HEKNIRESj HMiN and some of
the other 3S-guards.
The evidence to these shootings is contained in the Depositions
of ZIElihk (Deposition No. 35) } EWAED (Deposition No. 34) } BEHNKE
Reposition No. 37) > INl'IXNG (Deposition No, 38), S1HU1TZ Karl
(Deposition No. 39) , DURKEZ (Deposition No's 40 = 41)aM SCHLEN-
STEDT (Deposition No. 42).
In the second trans ort led by SCHUET 'E also several prisoners
have been shot, among them at least two Eussians and one Pole.
One of the prisoners was shot by SCHUETTE, who admitted the
shooting in his deposition (Deposition No. 7l)* He admitted
further that he shot tiis prisoner who was not trying to escape
and only because the prisoner tried to hide hi. self and stay
behind. The other victims have been killed to give an deterrent
example or in view of the fact that they were not able to march
further (KOOF.IANN and MAIOSTSDT, Deposition No's 35 and 33).
The bodies were left on the road in spite of the protests of
the local population and local police authorities. The food
given to the starving prisoners by the local population was ta-
ken a^ay by SCHUETTE and HEIINXNGS and the prisoners who received
the food were beaten up by SCHUETTE and HEININC-S.
Four death certificates of the victims shot during the march have
been traced in different registry offices by the investigating
officer, Capt. F.IJ. . AHNZR and are attached to this report as
Exhibits "0", "P", "S", and MS"; one of them refers definitely
to a Russian of Asiatic origin Hamid CHAI.HBO) , the second one
probably to a Czech (josef TIGHT).

IHDES 0? DIIPOSITIOI'TS OF THE ACCUSED:_________, Pep, No.
MSoKTITZ-BSHS:
In custody approx from September 1946. Depo-
sition obtained on the 20th April 1%.J. -
Admits that HDlvILlE passed an order to him
that the Fuehrer makes him personally res-
ponsible that none of the concentration camp
inmates should fall into the hands of the
enemy alive. He states that he had several
conversations with HIMMLEE in connection
with this order and refused to comply with
it. HIMMLER in the end Deft him a free hand
in this matter. BASSEWTTZ states that he
wanted to hand over all the prisoners to the
enemy but he admits further that inspite
of this he issued an order of evacuation
addressed to all prison commandants and
commandants of the concentz-ation camps.
He denies issuing the orders to execute
the 71 prisoners brought fz-om Fuhlsbuettel
to Neuengamme, but he admits that he was
approached by the Gestapo in this matter.
His explanation is that his name was mis-
used.
He denies issuing the orders to execute the
5 Russians females PoF and states that he
never heard about this case.
He admits, however, that as HSSEF he received
almost weekly reports on the state of mind of
the entire population of his Wehrkreis and
states that he was informed of all especial
events. He admits that on the 1st October 1944
he, as HSSPF, was granted the powers of Superior
Officer in charge of all Pdf's in his Wehrkreis,
He denies issuing an order to hand over recap-
tured Allied officers PoW to the Gestapo for
special treatment and states that it was not
until after the capitulation that he heard
about the existence of the special inter-
rogation centre in PUHLSBUETTEL.
In his statement he tries to give the impression
that the duties and pavers of an HSSEF are extreme-
ly limited and consist mainly in liaison duties be-
tween different departments of the security police
and the Party. But his attitude in regard to his
powers is proved false by his own statement.
In his. statement he tried to ciedje the impression
that the HSSPF was powerless to deal in all mat-
ters concerning' Concentration Gamps, but as can
be seen from the attached extract of an order
issued by HIMMLER on the 17th June 1944 (Exhibit
"T")	HSSPF was responsible for the military
security of all the concentration Camps and stood
by to assume complete control during alert periods
(A Fall). The period of alert was in force through-
out March and April 154-5 and this being the case
the Commandant of EEtMCAIME was mearly a member
of the HSSPF Staff.

WIERZEOWSKI, Polish Forces, of War Crimes Investigation Unit,
at HAMBURG, Maria-Luisenstr. 132, on this t\felfth day of December
1946.
I am Erika Frida Luis© ROHDE, born at HARBURG on 17/11/1909.
1 am Lutheran Protestant. I am a merchant by occupation and
am of German nationality. 1 was never a member of the NSDA.P
or any other NS organisation.
I have always been an opponent of National Socialism.
Since 1943 I was' actively working with'the resistance group
"Sampf Dem Fasohismus'1 (KDI ). My comrades were arrested on 6/4/45
I managed to hide till 9/4/45. On that day I was arrested and
taken to thePolice Prison FUHLSBUETTEL. I was there till
13/4/45, On that day I wasi sent on the transport to KIEL-Hasse.,
where I was liberated on 2/5/45.
On 10 or 11 April BI$MARK cam® to my ceM. and asked why
had been arrested. On my answer she told me: ’’You are all
going to be released. A lot is going to change, but you
needn't be afraid. We had a conference yesterday, but you were
not discussed."
On the 13th we went on the transport. ^ur rations consistefl
of about 400 gr. bread, 15 gr. margarine and about 50 gr.
cheese. During the distribution if the rations, the male
prisoners were kicked by several SS-men. ’e were taken onto
ship in the GRASBRSBK Gasworks, and had to go into the lowest*.;/*-*
holds, where there was no straw or any sanitary arrangements.
We were about 250 women of different nationalities. They
also put in to our room about 20 ppolish officers. One of
the women, from Luxembourg, had a child of 4 months. In
spite of her prayers, she received nothing for her child from
the transport leader. She herself could not feed the child,
which died in the camp at KIEL-H&ss© as a result of lacg of
food.
That is all I c an say about FUHLSBUETTEL.

Deposition on oath of Roger, Louis, Gustave DUBNEZ, male, 12, Rue de

Forces, of War'Crimes Investigation Unit, at PARIS, on this 14th day
of February 1947.	t
:)4 ,C ,	3/ ti o
I am Roger Louis Gustave DURKEZ, born on 22 Jan 1? at TROXES (Aube).
I am a packer. I am married and I have no children, I am catholic.
I was a Po¥ in Germany. I escaped from the camp and retmmed to France.
I have been drafted for compulsory work in Germany in December 1942.
I have been arrested by the Gestapo in February 1945 for listening to
the English broadcast and for sabotage. I h ve been taken to FUHLS-
BBSTTEL jail where I remained until the 12 Apr 45. On this day I have
been evacuated to the camp of KIEL-HASSE. I escaped from this, camp and
I returned to HAMBURG where I h ve been liberated by British troops.
I stayed all the time in FUBLSBUETTEL in solitary confinement and
that is the reason why I could not see what was happening there.
On the 12 Apr 45 we have been sent without previous notice to the camp
of KI1L-HASSE. We have been ordered in the morning to take off our pri-
son dress and to put on our civilian suites. A part of theprison rs who
have been a long time in goal had no footwear and they had to walk
barefooted in wooden shoes.After a few kilometres their feet were covered
with blood and wounds. When we left the prison we received about 2 lb
of bread and four peaces of chease. These rations v/ere ment for four
days. Paul REPPIEN one of the guards from FIJHLSBUETTEL, was in charge
of the convoy. The SS personnel which guarded us did not belong to the
staff of F UHL SB UETTEE and was composed of Russian, Flems and Germans.
In the convoy in which I have been, it was the convoy No. 2, there were
about 200-250 prisoners: Russians, Poles, Germans and a dozen Frenchmen.
During the whole march the guards beat the prisoners with the butt-end
of their rifles, with their fists, and kicked them. The prisoners, who
were exhausted and could hardly keep themselves, had to carry the SS-
men's kit. If anybody fell down and could not march any more the SS-men
tried to make him get up by kicking him and beating with the butt-ends.
If he could not get up any more, he remained lying on the road until
yr the end of the convoy passed. Then we heard from far behind submachine gun
fire killing these people.
I have seen Paul REPilEN shooting with his revolver at people who left
the convoy for a moment and did not come back quickly enough for him.
Not/ I remember th; t in the convoy No. 2 there were several Danes. At
the roll-call on the third morning of the march, after a night v/hich we
spent in a farm 12 km from KIEL two prisoners were missing. The SS-men
looked everywhere for them and found them in the hay. They beat them
with butt-ends in the face and then REP IEN killed them with his sub-
rnachinegun in our presence. I was in a distance of about 5 metres and
I have seen eveiything.
When we arrived in KIEL-£tASSE there were not less than 20 people missing^,
who had been killed during the march.
This is all jE can say about FUHLSBUETTEL.

Deposition on oath of Roger Louis Gustave DURUEZ, male, 12 Rue de
Monmorenoy, Paris (3e) sworn before Major J. LEN3EWSKI, Nigeria Regiment
of Field Investigation Section, War Crimes Group (NWE) at Paris on the 8th
of April 1947.
I was a prisoner of war in Germany. I escaped from the camp and I
returned to Prance.
In December 1942 I was conscripted to do compulsory labour in Germany.
In February 1945 I was arrested by the GESTAPO for listening to the English
radio programme and for acts of sabotage.
I was taken to FUHLSBUTTEL Prison and remained there until the 12th
April 1945 at which date I was evacuated with the KIEL-HASSE transport.
I escaped from the camp and returned to HAMBURG, where I was liberated
by British troups.
At FUHLSBOTTEL I spent all the time in solitary confinement and it is
for that reason that I do not know the names of the guards there.
On the 12th April 1945 we left for KIEL-HASSE.
I made a statement that I recognized EEPPIN from a photograph as the
Commandant of the KIEL-HASSE transport, but today I affirm after having seen
another photograph that it is more like HENNINGS, whom I recognize perfectly
fran his photograph taken in profile as the Commandant of the transport.

& rtrud Eriederieke MEYER-PLOCK
Deposition on oath of Gertud Priedericke MEIER-HjOCK, female,
of HAMBDBG, Maria-Luisenstr. 132, sworn before 2/Lt V/aclaw WIERZBOWSKI,
Polish Forces, of War Grimes Investigation Unit, at HAMBURG Maria-
Luisenstr. 132, on this twenty fifth day of November 1946.
I am Gertrud Friedericke liEIER-PLOCK, hee MEIER. I was born on 21
Jan 1898 at COLOGNE. I am an atheist. I attended the folksschule
and then made my Abitur (leaving examination at a secondary school).
For 1 -g- year I stidied chemics and now I am working in a laboratory.
The--woman's department of the police prison Fuhlsbuettel was in house
B. It was a building in the form of an L which was separated from
the other buildings by a large wall. The building had 3 floors and thw
wards v/ere called B cellar, B 1 , B 2, and B 3«
In B cellar there were: the boiler rooms, the bath and the desinfection
installation, the stores, admittance ceils, single cells and arrest cells.
The admittance cellsswere about 3x4 metres in size. The whole inventory
was a closet and very seldom there was also a bench. The new-arrivals
were locked into these.cells and had there to wait for the delousing.
According to the regulations the 1risoners had only to spend one night
in these cells but most of the female officials, especially BURMEI3TER,
used to "forget" the prisoners wo $hat they had to stay there for 3 days.
Mostly the cells were overcrowded and even 18 persons were imprisoned
in one cell. The last number refers to the women as it was worse in the
men's department. About 50-60 men were accommodated in two cells .The
arrest cells were usually cells with or without a bench, often they were
entirely dark, the prisoners had to serve special punishments there. More-
over there was a cage cell in the B cellar, ih was an ordanary cell
with a cage of iron bars, about a finger- thick. The whole cell was
filled with a bunk and a closet so that the prisoner could not move.
Very often the cell was entire^ dark.
In B 1 there was the guard room the rooms for the administration, and a
room with about 40 beds for the foreigners, mainly Russians, and the
single cells. One to three persons -ere accommodated in the single cells.
B 2 consisted of a room with about 40 beds and single cells, there was
a number of s-called small cells, which were only 3t,50 m wide. In B 3
there was again a large room and a smaller room, where formerly had been
some cells and the so-called French-rocm, because mostly Frertch and
Dutch female'prisoners were accommodated there, and single cells.
The admittance of new prisoners in the police prison Fuhlsbuettel
happened as follows: I watched it many times as in Winter 1944/45
I was the prisoner in charge of the baths and boilers. Without ex-
ception all new prisoners came from, the Gestapo Gebaeude (building)
also when they had been transferred from other prisons, this in-
dicated that the pilice prison Fuhlsbuettel actually was a Gestapo
prison. The transports arrived at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon
and were delivered by the transport commander with the arrest warrant
in B 1. Owing to the negligance of the officials I have often seen
the arre t warrants. On the arrest warrants there was a remark as﻿Page 2

to the measures v/hich had to be taken. The special treatment '.as
carried out as follows-: The prisoner was kept in a single cell,
separated from certain persons, was not allowed to receive letters,
or parcels, had no hours off, was subject toe rtain arrest measures,
stoppage of food, he received no blankets and mattrasses, d rk cell,
was put into iron. In B 1 the new prisoners had to stand motionless
with"the face to the wall. As the new prisoners did not yet know the
regulations there were shoutings and beatings from the officials on
duty. The following officials beat frequently: The Head SCHULZ,
BimilSTSE, BOOH, KSEUTZ, BISMAHK, BOEffllEHN. Especially the fo-
reigners and Jews were treated badly. The a/m officials pullea them^ at
the hair and pushed them with the face against the wall. When ore lirst
formalities had besn carried out the women were led into the cellar into
a waiting room. When there we. e not sufficient new prisoners on one day,
the prisoners had to wait until the next day. After the women had bean
fetched from the admittance cell^ they ahd to undress entirely^and
were searched. Afterwai-ds the clothing was taken to mie delousing. as
the delousing' installation was too small the clothing was put on
a heap and therefore most of the clothing as ruined. The shoes
were put into a lisol solution. In the meantime the women had a bath
but they never had sufficient warn water. After the bath they were de-
loused but they received no towels. The bath was in the cellar and even
in Winter it was not heated. After the delousing some women received
an old, tom, and mostly stinking blanket. Generally uhe xoreigners
did not receive such a blanket. After the bath the wo.,men Returned
naked either tb the admittance cell or to the ward. Generally the women re
ceived their clothing the next morning although they had been deloused
the evening before. During the bath the officials shouted and frequently
beat the prisoners. Mostly this was done by SCHULZ, BUSKEISTSR, 30QH,
BISMAKK, BORGLHBHEN, BURMEISTER tried to ruin the pirsoners’ clothing.
She always mat e sure th t the prisoners on dutjr did not hide the good
clot ing, so that they could not be deloused. I have seen that LJUBA,
a Ru sian girl, who was a prisoner in charge of the baths as myseli,
was beaten by BUIMSISTER for this reason.
This was the daily routine in the women’s department in the prison
Fuhlsbuettel: Reveille at 6 o'clock a.m. The prisoners had to wash
themselves, to clean the cell and to make their bed. After that tne
coffee ms distributed. After the coffee the cellss had to be wiped.
Mo-tly we received no rags and had to take a prece of our clotning.
After that the work was allotted to the prisoners. A part of the
prisoners had to ork outside the prison, the others had to make
paper-bags or to pack spices. If the prisoners had severe arrest
they received no work which was extremely depressing. In the after-
noon we theoretically had an hour off, but we did not have it regu-
larly as the officials forgot ot or purposely deprived us of it.
When we had the hour off, the single cells were opened and we went
into the corridor with the face to the wall. When the single celxs
had lined up the large room was opened. There was mostly a mess,
as'we had to go out suddenly and were not prepared for it. The offi-
cials shouted and beat us and often sent us back to the cells so that
we had no hour tiff. When all had lined up vie were led into the
court-yard. We walked round in a distance of 5 metres, it was
strictly forbidden to speak. When anybody had spoken, he was
fetched and put with the face to the mil, or sent upstairs, or
beaten, which mostly was done with foreigners or Jews. Also preg-
nant women were beaten, they were beaten as well as tne otheis, con-
sequently in one year only one woman bore the full time. All the
others had miscarriages or premature birthes. In this connection
I remember one incident. Magda THUERAI collapsed during the hour off.
A french Woman, named Christia RIVAL, a medical student, assisted her,
vdiich was strictly forbidden. Thereupon she was beaten by BISMARK and
she ordered that the French woman should not recieve food for 3 days.
In connection with the hour off X remember also the following* BISMAE5C
who liked to maltreat the foreigners for some time deprived the French
p&oners fro. the ^ur ff.	^tged Jh|tf^eignj^^t^ogg^
to line upry found a reason ror onuuuititi,
into the room.﻿Page j

On this occasion I want to mention that I called on BISHARK in August
1+5 to get some information from her. On this occasion she told me
that the officials had to beat as SCHULZ had ordered them to do so,
BURMEI3T.ER behaved worse during the hour off. Every prisoner was afraid
of her;on every occasion she beat and ordered stoppage of food.
I remember one incident with BURHEISTER. Two French women who
were kept separated in single cells wanted to excahnge a few
words during thejiour off. BULL SISTER noticed this, hit and kicked
the woman who haS spoken and put her into the arrest cell in the cellar.
The other who had listened was put against the wall.
Once BUEMEISTES brought her lover 3CHULZKE along for the hour off.
lie had to run at the double and BURMEISTES indicated those women
who should be beaten to SCHULZKE. SCHULZES beat them with his fists,
and kicked them with his feet. 6 women were beaten in this way. Later
some of them were punished with arrest by BURMEISTER.
We received the following food: twice a day a piece of bread thick
as a thumb, and so-called coffee or tea. For lunch we received
one litre or less soup which consisted of salted vegetables, only
on few occasions we received fresh vegetables. The salted vegetables
mainly consisted of: sweeds, cabbage and sometimes a few peas. It
was so sour that it was hardly edible. From Autumn 1944 we generally
received 4 potatoes per person. Once a week we received a spoon of
marfaelade or cheese. Partly the marmelade was stolen by the officials,
and water was added. BOCH, BISHARK, BURL LEISTER and KREUTZ did this.
I have seen this, when I worked in the prison. During the whole time
from December 1943 until August 1944 the prisoners at Fuhlsbuettel
received no margarine. I heard a conversation in the Gestapo Building
that this happened by order of an important personality. The quality
of the soup deteriorated because the criminals and the Russian
spy HATJA took off the fat.
The pe reels which the prisoners received from their relatives,
or the foreigners from the International Red Cross were regu-
larly opened and things were taken out. One part was taken out
officially and we were told that these things should be distri-
buted among those prisoners who had to work hard. Certainly we
were right when we doubted that the parcels were distributed
honestly. Some parcels were not delivered to the prisoners as
a punishment. This had been ordered by SCHULZ. Also those who
were under arrest, received no parcels. Moreover, there was a
parcel blockade which was the punishment of the Gestapo. Marichen
MARTENS, and Barbara D0LLL7ETZSL who both were political prisoners
and were arrested at Fuhlsbuettel for a long time told me that the
Red Cross Parcels of the foreigners wer.e looted systematically,
especially by BISMARK. Pregnant women received no additional ra-
tions. As far as I know a diet was only issued for German non-
political prisoners and spies, for instance MEBCHA-t- FOEGE and
LUEBERS.
BiiKMEBEER did not issue the margarine to foreigners who were ill
and gave them less food with the remark: "Illness is only lazyness,
and lazy persons need no food."
When I was in charge of the boiler I watched that BISM&EK went up-
stairs secretly and gave stolen margarine, marmelade and cheese to
those who had worked for her personally.
As the foreigners had only one tom blanket they went to bed in their
clothes. Thereupon BORGEKEHN ordered that in the evening the prisoners
h' d to put their clothes in front of the door. A further consequence
was that in the morning when it was dark the prisoners could not find
their clothes. This was the cause for new shoutings and beatings.
Prisoners suspected of diphtheria were put into unheated single cells﻿Page 4
1/
TO 3s separated from the others, although there were also heated cells.
I remember cases when sick foreigners were squeezed into one cell and
furthermore a healthy prisoner had to look after them.
I heard that BISblAECK said to another official during a conversation
about the cases of disease: "Let them die like dogs. Then there will^
be some foreigners less who only consume our food.1. SCHULZ made a similar
remark in front of the door of the sick Jugoslav.
Shortly before Christmas 19^4 when the cases of disease increased SCHULZ fourj
a general remedy. The whole room, whether sick hr healthy, wqs sent
to Wilhelmsbijrg to the Labour Camp, it is said that there a number of
prisoners died owing to the bad conditions and overwork.
BOE&MvHBH invented the following maltreatment. If a room was searched
the prisoners had to undress entirely and to stana in the hall until
all the clothing and the hall was searched.
Gertrud DKEHER, who lived in my cell cucceeded in being examined by a doctor]
because of an epigastric rupture. She was put on' the examination chair,
the commandant T1SS was present the whole time and also when other
women were examined.
Different kinds of arrest: Community arrest in rooms.
Community arrest in cells, (2-3 persons).
Ordinary single arrest.
Single arrest, during the hour off separated from the others.
Severe single arrest. The prisoner was put into chains and had no hour off.
Arrest: Ordinary arrest, arrest in the dark, arrest in chains (ii a priso-
ner was sentenced to arrest he was locked into the cellar and received a
warn meal every four days). In August 1945 IS' ABIE told me that a special
permit was reauired to puni h a prisoner with arrest, until SuHOLZ was ap-
pointed. put SCHULZ was entitled to inflict the arrest punishment with
TESSMAKN*s approval. Furthermore BISLABOK told me that Maria DEEEMBEKG
stayed in the arrest cellar for 8 weeks, 7 of them in chains. SCHULZ could
have prevented it. DEEELHERG was emaciated from the long arrest to such
an extant that she died quickly after the arrival at EAWSBEUECK.
Moreover, there were the so-called "Special cells". These were not a special
kind of cells. Sometimes they were in B 1 and sometimes in B 2. The name
of the inmate was not filled in at the door. 'N0body saw these prisoners.
X t was said that they were foreigners and Jews. They received their food
in a mug from the official and not, as usual, from a prisoner. When I was
in single an-est in B 2, I noticed that the inmates of these cellss were
sometimes fetched during the night for an interrogation, later they returned
In these cells there were the most cases of suicide.
The whole system and the treatment of the prisoners indicates that it was
the main task of Fuhlsbuettel prison th/ break the political prisoners
mentally, morally and physically, to get a statement from them. All the abo-
ve mentioned kinds of arrest as well as the unnecessary trouble cau. efi by
the personnel were used for this purpose. The prisoners.were frightened so
that they were easier to interrogate by the Gestapo. I air ady mentioned tha
the kind of treatment was prescribed on the arrest warrant so that the
officials were informed about the political attitude of the prisoners^,
and the treatment which had to be applied according to the instructions
of the Gestapo. For the same purpose a net of spies had been spread over,
the building. Prisoners who were especially suspected even were accompanied
when they were kex>t in a single cell.
In this connection I want to emphasize that the officials were informed
about everything* A conversation with BOHGLI.iLHIl convinced me oi this.
Wien I asked her what would happen to those foreigners who were sent
away as they -/ere too dangerous, she answered: "They cannot do any more
damage”. M0reover she and ELSKABK told me tfhat the report of Fuhlsbuettel﻿Page 5

prison was of some importance when the prisoners were transferred to
a camp. The officials told me that mostly they knew our cases and the
man in charge of them. 3131 HK a well as ECEB TH indicated that it was
their task to help the interrogators. For instance BIS'. .wRK said to various
prisoners: "HELMS is such a nice man, admit it, it would be better for
you".
In Spring 1944/ifSi five Eussian girls were sent to Fuhlsbuettel. I saw them
naked in the hall. They,"/ere in a horrible state, their body was bruised and
they had frightened faces. I know that they were kept for days without clothing|
in the cell. Two weeks later we had a bath together with them and could
see the marks of the horrible maltreatment. KEFUZ, BOCH and other officials
told us, that these girls had looted and should be shot. One day they left
F'UHLSBIIETTEL, I do not know what happened to them.
At PUHLSBUETTEL there was a Russian, named Luba BCffi3ARSKEb. She was in
charge of the boiler and I worked with her for some time. She v/as very
proud and therefore hated by all officials. AH officials said: "One
should break the neck of this damned beast". She was permanently beaten,
maltreated and received no food. This was espeically done by SCHULZ,
B0RGE1.EHN, BOCH and BUEMEI3T2R, One day when the bulb in her room was
fused she took a spare bulb from the boiler roan to use it whole she
drank her coffee. BORCEHEHT noticed this. She pulled Luba DOKDAPJBTI'O
out of the cell at the hair, beat, her and pus^hed her down the stairs,
she was locked into a cell in the cellar. She had to deliver the
whole prison clothing and received nothing to eat. I do not know what
happened to her.
Maria, a Russian girl, was locked into the cage cell. She was cold as
it wa Winter and she had no clothing, only her frock. She sang and
danced on the bunk to get ar. The officials did not like this and poured
coHid water over Maria. B0CH+ told me that ans when I asked her why Maria
was wet. Furthermore BOCH told me that another prisoner who was also under
arrest had been put into water for three days.
One evening in Autumn 1944 EEK1TINCS was on duty. He and BUEaEISTBR came
into the large room in B 2 and when he opened the door one pxrssner was
standing beside the opened window. Thereupon all prisoners had to get up
and had to do physical exercise on the ground. This lasted for about -y an
hour. Lafer we heard that water was poured. The next day the prisoners told
us that water had been poured over them when they were already lying in
their beds,

Waclaw V/IEEZBOffSKI, Polish Forces, of War Crimes Group (NWE) Field
Investigation Section, at No 5 GIG on this eleventh day of March 1947.
I, Emma Luise Emilie BLMBACH, have been warned that I am not compelled
to answer these questions, but that everything I say will be taken down,
and may be used as evidence. I make this statement voluntarily without
the use of force, or promise of reward.
I am Emma Luise Emilie ELAUEA.GH, nee NAG-AT, born at BREDSTEDT Kr HUSUM,
on 20 Nov 1901. I am of Evangelical faith, German nationality, a house-
wife, married and have no children.
Until 1942 I was a housewife, working in the household. When my husband
was called up^ I load to -work and became an office clerk for a period of
one year. Then my mother fell ill and I was granted leave to look after
her. I nursed my mother for one year, and thaa, as a result of the
complete mobilisation, I was sent to work in the Police Prison FUHLS-
BUETTEL. I worked there until 15 April 1945* when I left at my own re-
quest. I was arrested on the 29 Jan 46.
I never beat any prisoners, nor did I see other femal officials beat
prisoners.
I do not kno’w who was responsible for selecting the 13 women v/ho lost
their lives in NSUMGAMME.
That is all I can say about FUELS3USTTEL.

SASEL Concentrati

/
1.
A -- HC». .	^7^3	^ A p r
The relevant report and depositions in this case are
enclosed for your consideration and advice to the army Commander.
2.	This case has arisen out of the prosecution of the staff
at SASEL Concentration Camp and at that time, the present accused
was NOT in arrest.
3.	It will be remembered that SASEL was one of the minor
dependencies belonging to NEUENGAMME Concentration Camp and
formed part of the Stutzpunkt Spaldingstrasse HAMBURG.
4.	It appears that the accused, although NOT a qualified
doctor, held the rank of Scharfuehrer in the SS and was in charge
of the sick quarters at SASEL Camp. The female witness Ursula
EBERSTEIN, now under sentence, was an S3 woman responsible under
KEMMERICH for the female sick quarters at SASEL.
5.	It appears that at a date which has NOT been exactly
determined but towards the end of 1944, there was a female Polish
prisoner, Helene TZYMALKQWSKA, a Jewess, who was brought in from
one of the working parties of the camp to the hospital where
KEMMERIGH presided.
6.	Apparently the Polish Jewess was in good physical condition
but she is supposed, by the eviden e of the witness Estera GLASER
(Deposition No. 1) to have been beaten on the work site immediately
prior to her admission to sick bay.
^•	In this sick bay, she appears to have shouted and remonstrated
against the Nazi regime whereupon she was examined by the accused
KEMMERICH who prescribed a daily course of morphine injections and
taking of luminal tablets.
8.	The evidence of the Jewish nurse Estera GLASER (Deposition
No.l) and of the SS woman Ursula EBERSTEIN (Deposition No.2.) goes
to show that KEMMERICH quite deliberately reduced this fit and
healthy woman within a space of three weeks to such a poor physical
condition by lack of food coupled with strong doses of morphia and
luminal that she died.
9.	The difficulty in the case lies in the fact that, of the
three prosecution witnesses, two of them are already under sentence
as former members of the SASEL Concentration Camp staff and Ifchat
there may be difficulty in freezing the Polish Jewess Estera GLASER
who is supposed, to be living at BELSON-HOHNE DP Gamp but steps
are being taken to endeavour to ensure her attendance at any trial.
10.	. It is thought that the strength of the doses mentioned in
Deposithn No. 1, both relating to Morphia and Luminal are not, in
themselves, excessive as the strength of the solution is not given
but that the surrounding evidence^both of the statement of the ^
accused KEMMERICH and the method of treatment of the patient and
her rapid physical decay; are all consistent and point to a clear
killing of the Jewish victim by the accused KEMMERICH.
11.	The accused KEMMERICH has NOT made a deposition but a note
of his interrogation in the form of question and answer, together
with the supporting affidavit by the interrogator is included in
the report - deposition No. 4 - and it is felt that, having regard
to the difficulties experienced in interrogating this man that the﻿﻿RESJRI 31^0

This witness should produce the questions and answers
contained in Deposition No. 4 of the accused and should
attend the trial to give evidence of the full circumstances
of the interrogation and should also_produce the meldcal
certificate relating to the accused Exhibit A.2. and
state the circumstances in which it was obtained.
For A(PS4) only : Note re Estera GLASER :
It is thought that there may be some difficulty
in locating this witness. The present address was gi/©n ak 31 Dec 46»
when the camp was then under the control of 711/618/R/ Detachment
Mil Gov and it is thought that this formation has now closed down.
The camp is administered by UNRRA and difficulties have been experienced
in the past in making witnesses in this camp available for trial.
This particular witness is of great importance to this trial and it is
urged that every effort be made both to freeze and make her available
at any trial that may be advised in this case.﻿6.

The first named witness is at present in BELSBN-HOHNE Camp but
it is understood that unless the trial takes place in the near
future she may have unavoidably been repatriated to Poland. The
last named two witnesses are at present serving 4 sentences of
FUHLSQu&Tr&L
imprisonment at the STRAPANSTALT, TUfoilfuaML, HAMBURG-.
If any of the above-named witnesses are not available their
statements should be handed in to the court in accordance with
the provisions of Regulation 8(l)(a) .
(b) Captain H. SCMKIGER should be called in person at the trial to
■'W'
give evidence of the interrogation of the accused conducted by
him on the 1A December 1^46.
7. The Judge Advocate General further directs me to say that he does not
consider^ that the case is one in which he should depute a Judge Advocate
nor does he consider that a Judge Advocate is necessay. You may consider
that this is a case in which, if a permanent President is to preside over
the Court, it is not necessary to appoint a legal member in which event
a certificate to that effect should be inserted on the Army Form A.4.
In ray opinion this is a case in which the prosecution, should be
conducted by an officer with legal qualifications and application should
be made through War Crimes Group, North West Burope, for the appointment
of such an officer.
5. You will doubtless arrange fov the accused to be defended by a German
iil German
lawyer. The accused should be supplied with copies/of the docuwcntiEr
referred to in paragraph 6 above.
10.	A copy of the Charge Sheet will be required for the use of the
prosecutor in addition tothe original which should be in the hands of the
President. Copies of the evidence will be required for the use of the
President and prosecutor in addition to the originals which should be in
the hands of the prosecutor.
11.	An impartial person competent to act an an interpreter in the German
laneuasre should be available at the trial.	________________﻿﻿12. The following documents are fowarded herewith
(a)	The originals in German and two copies in German and eight copies
in Snglish of the statements of:

SUBJECT: War Crimes Trial.
SASEL No. II.
Kurt Otto KEMMERICH.
1.	The a/n was tried before a Military Court at HAMBURG.
The trial began on the 11 Mar and finished on the 31 Mar 47.
2.	The Rourt consisted of a permanent president, Lt.CoL
GLENDINNING and the prosecutor was Capt. P. POTTS of this Section,
3.	The accused was charged with being concerned in the
killing of Helene TZYMALKOWSKA, a Polish national.
4.	As you will have already heard, the accused was, after
a lengthy trial, found 'not guilty'.
5.	The prosecutor has made a report of the case from which
it appears that two of the prosecution witnesses who were already
serving sentences as convicted war criminals, went back on their
depositions and alleged that they had no previous knowledge of
the incident. These two witnesses were EBERSTEIN, a former
33 woman and STARK, a former Lagerfuehrer. EBERSTEIN is sefving
a setnence of 3 years' imprisonment and STARK is serving 8 years'
imprisonment and the prosecutor got the impression that both of
them, in spite of the assurance of the court that they had nothing
to lose or gain, declined to state anything that incriminated
themselves. In particular, EBERSTEIN departed from her proof
and she at the moment has submitted a petition for the review of
her sentence which may have affected her attitude. Both witnesses
were treated as hostile with the members of the court.
6.	Apart from these difficulties.as far as one can
ascertain, the reason for the acquittal was that the court was
not satisfied that the Polish victim died as a consequence of the
drugs that were administered and the lack of nourishment. On
that point, the court heard the evidence of Major MANT of the
Medical Section of this Group and the prosecutor came to the
conclusion that the court, after hearing the evidence of Major
- over -﻿

WlAMT. would be in two minds as to the cause of the death of the
vieturn.
7.	Apart from what has been stated above, the trial
raised no outstanding points of interest or difficulty.

SHORT STATEMENT OF FACTS.
A case has already been registered against a number of members of the staff
of Sasel Concentration Camp. The present accused is a further member of the staff,
who has recently been arrested. He was responsible for the medical care of internees
of the camp and in November 1944 he treated a female Polish national, who had been
sent to the camp hospital after a beating-up in the camp. This Polish woman was
apparently overcome by the ill-treatment she had received and while in hospital gave
voice to a violent outburst against the Nazi. Party, The accused came to see her and
quite openly announced to members of the hospital staff that he intended to give her
treatment which would eventually result in her death.	He thereupon gave orders for
her limbs to be bound with wire to prevent her becoming violent and prescribed large
daily doses of morphia and thrice daily doses of luminal. The accused further
ordered that no food was to be given to the patient in order to reduce her powers of
resistance and thus making the poison more effective. Two or three weeks after this
treatment commenced the patient died from heart failure, undoubtedly caused by

NOTES ON THE CASE
(Under this heading should be included the view taken as to [a) the degree of^^
responsibility of the accused in view of his official position, e.g., was offence
committed on the offender’s own initiative, or in obedience to orders, or in carrying
out a system approved by authority or a legal provision ; (b) the probable defence,
(c) whether the case appears to be reasonably complete.)
This appears to be a clear case of deliberate killing and there
can be no defence.﻿-4l

1o I am -Sstera CL-SHR, born on 1st January 1910, occupation: nurse, of
Jewish faith and statelesso
I speak and read German fluently and therefore I am vdlling to make
this statement in Germano
2.	Prom the beginning of 1944 until March 1945# I was a prisoner in
S^SML Concentration Gamp and was employed there as a Bead Nurse in the
hospital. .another female prisoner, Dr. BIKILNI, who :was later shot at
■BELSEN worked as a 'ootor. My immediate superior' in the hospital was the
,ujfseherin Ursula EBERSTEIN. She was responsible to the medical oixiccr
KEii ERICH, who acted as a doctor.
3.	approximately at the end of 1944 a Jewish Polish prisoner, Helena
^7,nT.KnvfSK;, was sent from the working site to the hospital. She had been
beaten on the working site and therefore was bleeding from the mouth ana
had a headache. TZYitiKOVSIL- was very healthy and had a strong _
constitution. Never before she had .needed medical treatment anc. it was
generally known that she had a strong singing-voice.
4.	During the following night she started to rage in the hospital ana.
v/hen I tried to calm her she told me that for once she had to give.way to
her feelings against the Nazis. The noise attracted other German personnel,
among' them EBERSTEIN, they laughed and concluded that she was mad.
The next day EBERSTEIN went to KElliERICH and reported the incident.
5. Thereupon KEMMGRICH visited the hospital, he came alone,
examination of 1EHJ»1mLKCK7SK«. the following persons were present;

Now KHMINHICH told me to fill the syringe with two ampules i, e. oubd^
centimetres morphine, which I carried duto I handed him the syringe and
he. intended to administer the injection himself, but the patient defended
herself and cried: "T know this is-a lethal injection".. Now KE1®£E1RXGH
ordered the German personnel to hold, down the patient and I had to make
her unconscious by holding a piece of cotton wool soaked in ethyl chloride
over her nose. Then KSlVivURIGH administered the injection.
60 Several days later KK iHiild came back to the sick-hay again and
vi'sited TZYltiiKOdSK.. who was still very strong and was still cursing the
Nazis. During the whole period of his visit I was present. hfter
KDilMURICH had looked at the patient he left the bod with us and sail:
"Good Go do She must have a h.art cf iron, she must not be. given anything
to cat or drink". Furthermore he increased the morphine dose from two
to three cubic-centimetres per day. 8T.1RK, EBERSTEIN, and myself then
accompanied KEMvASRICH to the exit and SThRK said to KSMiGRICH; in my
presence; "You have certainly made a fool of yourself, there, doctor, she
is still alive and causes an uproar in the camp". KEIv'iMERIGH replied:
"Oberscharfuehrer, do not worry she is going to 'croak' yet.' It. is not
my fault that she has such a strong heart". KEUdvIGRIGH also said that I
should be watched sc that I could not give any of my food to the patient
as I was a "compassionate, sister".
7»	.J.1 KEMERICH's instructions were in fact carried out, the injections
being administered by the- lady-doctor, EBERSTEIN gave her luminal and said
that it was vitamins. Three or 4 days later KEMviERIGH came again and in
my presence he ordered tha.t the patient was to have her hand© and feet
bound with wire, because she was still very lively. Once I tried to give
the patient some of my food but KEMMSRIGH caught me in the act,because ho
saw the food standing beside the bed, and threat ued me with the gas-
chamber.
8.	lifter KEMviERICH' s second visit the patient deteriorated visibly her
complexion became, black, ■ she grew very thin and then became unconscious,
approximately two weeks after she had been brought to the hospital she
died of heart failure. V/hen KSkMERICH was told, in my presence, that
T2YI4LK0WSm was dead he said to ST.iRK: "It is a pity that: wfc did not have
a bet, as I would have won".
9.	I am a professional nursing Sister with'14 yeoxs experience and on
account of my professional knowledge I am firmly convinced that
T7,Y'.l. T.xnWSK. was. absolutely healthy when she was'brought into the sick-bay
excepting small injuries as a result of blows; she was poisoned by the
deliberate, death treatment, of morphine and luminal as- ordered by KiMvIBRICH.

Deposition-on oath of Ursula EDSRSTiiltT, fouole, of Ha iburg-Fuhlsbuettel,
Strafanstalt, av/orn before H. SOIMlIGffilR, Oapt. , Gen. List, of War Crimes
Investigation Unit-, at PUULSDUSTTLL, on 5th Day of Dooe iber, 1946.
1.	I an Ursula JLHRSTLII'i, born on 22nd November 1522, a shop assistant and of Gerjan
nationality.
Fron the beginning until the .liddle of November 1544, at the tine of Bella
DSmLEtCiliKi-.'s death, I was an gufseherin in the rbeitslager (Labour Carip) SiSSL.
2.	iit that ti ic KSlvftfdHICH Kurt was in charge of the sick-bay in the ‘’Stuetzpunkt"
(jain-ca.ip) area of Hiii.TDUHG. -His superior was Hauptstur. ifuchrer Dr. TZIBIMSKY at
MEUEHO/u-l-jL.	KEM LKICH was responsible for the sick-bays of the various caups
attached to the i.;ain cagrp, a.jong the,* S4SLL.
3.	I .yself ',.-as responsible for the .aedical supplies and the cleanliness of the
sick-bay at SiKLilL, but during the day I had to. work outside the oa op. Dr, Irene
BnitTnNI, /ho was shot in 1943 at BLLS.bN was the doctor in charge of this sick-bay.
I as well as Dr. BkhTAKY were directly subordinated to KHg LEIGH, . KEtLEEICH
inspected our sick-bay about every four weeks and then we had to report to hie,
So etioes, in urgent cases, K1ILdd^ICH was acco .ipanied■ by a doctor, usually it was
a French prisoner fro.i SPALDIHGSTE. , a professor (surgeon). I do not fcio'.- his
present whereabouts. He told -..o that he has a clinical hospital at PAkIS where
he was arrested as he refused to treat G-er.ian soldiers. I only know that in 1945
he was sent to AUSCHWITZ as a doctor.
4.	0berstur./fuehrer WHDI&aNN was the general superior of Kdt&lJEICH, in his
capacity as Stuetzpunkt lei ter SPAIDINGSTEASSE, but he had nothing to do with the
sick-bay._
5.	Bella DZmLM)¥SXA was in Novcubcr 1944 admitted to the sick-bay at SASLL .
as she spoke nonsense and .’.ade a uontelly confused inpression.	physically she
-,;as entirely sound and healthy. One or two days later she had a fit during the
night and raved and cried. I as well as the doctor therefore assumed that sho
was mentally insane. Every day I had to go to- the ..-.ain-ca/Tp and the next day I
called on KiiiJwICH to report to hi. and to ask hi; for a syringe which the doctor
-■/anted to ad inis ter to her as a sedative. Thereupon Lei.* EKICH said to ec;
"Nonsense, an injection for an insane wo.ian, shoot r bullet into her head1’.
6.	I as well as KUI-l-LEIGH knew quite well that the routine policy of the SS was
to kill prisoners who were not fit for work. Especially Kiilivi. LEIGH know this as
he/had been at mUSCBWITZ for so ;e ti ;e.	. boreov/.r an'order had. been issued by
IT/UENGAi-LE to report all prisoners who prosu .ably -would be nil for /ore th/ii 4
weeks to NEUEMtiJL.IB in order to be transferred to JijUEPSajn-Jj. Everyoody. Icfiew
that they were, killed there. Such a transport was connected with ,iuch clerical
work for ILJi EnlCH. Already at the tine when I called on him I had the ^definite.
i ipression that he intended to avoid these troubles. , He did nor say this verbally
but I assumed this fron his remark with "the outlet into the head". This was
easy for hi' as ho had the authority to do with sick prisoners what he wanted co
do with then. I know this as I saw the death certificates .:ndo out by hi., and
I noticed that he filled thou in at.will. Therefore it was easy for hi., to bu.rp
the patient off in order to avoid the transport to NuUliNS4li~3.
7.	The day after I had reported to KukiEiNICH, he himself inspected the sick-bay
at SiiSEL accompanied by the French professor. Both examined the . prelent. ,
LEM- .SKICH said that shw was malingering thereupon she started-to insult Hi dor
and the Nazis. The professor ascertain' that sho was sufferin; from tho nerves.﻿t-
*
•
Thuxeupon MtcICH prescribed the "cure". Although he did not say it' expressly
os it is dangerous to speak openly in a concentration carjp it was. apparent that he
intended to kill pZU,SAIiKOWSK/i-with a too strong dosis. I heard that he mentioned
morphine and luminal but I cannot remember the dosis. I assumed from the doctor's
and professor's horri.fied faces that he purposely .prescribed a too strong and
lethal cure. It was quite apparent from the expression of the faces of these two
that Km,. iaklGH intended to kill the patient. Moreover KHKERICH ordered that the
•patient should receive only half rations .which was very littlc-iii a concentration
ca ;p. A person could not have lived on half a ration, except perhaps when one
stayed in bed,	KiSa' 'ERICH said to me; 'Vhy fatten the mad unnecessarily, she is
.luch too strong and would only cry still more; moreover it -would prolong the "cure".
It -was obvious that he meant "prolong her life". But I did not obey his orders
and gave her food lyself.
8. The next day the doctor told me that luminal is a sedative but that a too
strong dosis, like that which KBIT.BBICH had prescribed for the patient, would
always have a lethal effect. KBiliBltlCH knew exactly the effect of luminal and
morphine and knew that the dosis he had prescribed for the patient would have a
lethal effect. He was very experienced in medical respect.
9« Also the patient had the impression that 1013.1 DUE OH intended to kill her, as
she was always very afraid of him and would not take the prescribed cure.
Therefore the d octor had ordered that DZYlvtAUCOWSKA was to be tied to the bed so
that KDSI'iERICH's orders could be carried out. At first this was done with a string
and later when the string was torn with insulated wire. I myself have seen that
she was tied and after three days I ordered the doctor to remove it.
10.	I do not know any details about the cure prescribed by KiMCEiilCH.	The
doctor administered it and the first time KiMERICH himself administered the
injection. Only once I gave the patient pills,, the doctor told ,ie that they
contained vitamines and I myself took one. I know that the doctor gave her also
lu.iinal tablets, as prescribed by KeMBERICH, but I was never present.
11.	When after about a week K.l , ERICH came again to the sick-bay he looked at
the patient once again. Apparently he was not satisfied with the progress of
the deterioration. I do not know whether ..he increased the "remedy", but when I
saw him the day after in the main camp he said; '•Well, how is your insane, is
she dead already?" When I answered In the negative, he continued: "Docs she
receive- her injections?" I told hi - that the female doctor had told me that the
patient did not want to subject herself to injections -./hereupon he andsnered;
'Tell the doctor that under all circumstances she must give the.injections otherwise
I will come and will give her some injections myself, but those will be proper
injections".
I do not know why KEA. ERICH asked all this as on the proceeding day he Himself
had been in the sick-bay, however, it might have been possible that he really
ordered a considerable increase of the dose, and that is why he inquired the next
day.
12.	Three weeks after the prescribed cure had commenced (prescribed by
KMiiwnlCH) , DZBUlLKOWSKA died. Cause of death was failure of the heart, and
during the last few days' she was already unconscious.
13* I am convinced that KEM/EEICH's cure had .killed her. When she was brought
to .the sick-bay she was in a very fit state. After OTASRICH1 s cure commenced
she litterally declined from day to day and was continually starving, T'he
difference in her physical condition within a period of three weeks was appalling.
14* I do not know about any similar cases where KELL ERICH is concerned.
I think that he left LffidvLBURG in February, 1945.

sworn before H.SCHlvEIGER, Captain, Gen. List, of War Crimes Investigation Unit
at FUHLSBUETTEL, on the sixth day of December 11946,
1.	I an Leonhard STARK, born on 30th September 1391, a gardener by occupation
and of Gorman Nationality. On 1st November 1944 I took over the Camp SASEL as
Camp Commandant. The hospital belonged to the camp but I was not entitled to
give orders there. KE /ERICK was in charge of the hospital (Revicr),
KELMERICH had not even to report to me but had a certificate from NEDENGm’ME
which entitled, him to enter the camp at any time. ^ female pjrisoner worked in
the camp as doctor and every morning she reported me the number of sick.
2.	When I arrived in the camp BASEL Helene DZXM/iLKO'n'SKR was already in the
hospital. The Deputy Camp Commandant PAASCH told me this, furthermore he told
me, that she was mad'and insulted Hitler and the Nazis. The imASCH reported to
me that the medical orderly KEif‘ERICH had arrived to look after the insane and
then I myself went to the hospital. This happened at the beginning of November.
3.	when I arrived in the hospital and entered the room of the patient the
following persons were present: KEMMERiCH, the French professor E3ERSTEIN, I
believe, DUELLER, the female doctor, GLASER or LEVI. When I arrived the
examination had already been carried out and I was told that KZMALKOWSKA was mad.
Then KBIME ICH spoke to the female doctor and prescribed a cure with morphiume.
I had the impression that KEMMERICH intended to kill the patient, although he
did not say it, as I thought that the number of prescribed injections would
paralize the patient's heart. KEMivERICH brutal face, when he prescribed this
'cure' confirmed thia. I was still present when KEMMERICH administered the
first injection to the patient. The patient resisted as she feared KEMMERICH
very much and called for EBERSTEIN.
4.	Some days later I heard, I believe from the female doctor, that KSMMERICH
did. not consider the first cure strong enough and that he therefore had increased
it. I was not told the reason but presumed that the patient did not die quick
enough for KE ■ ERICH.
5.	Some days after KEMMERICH's a/m visit in the hospital the secretary pAASCH
said to me; "With regard to the mad woman we have to wait for the effect of
KEM'ERICH's methods would result in the death of the patient. I as well as
PAASCH presumed that KEMMERICH intended to kill the patient.
6.	About the middle of November the death of the patient was reported to me.
The cause of death was heart weakness.
7.	I knew KPh " ERICH already from the camp at Dessauer Ufer, already there I
noticed him because of his brutal methods. I cannot remember any details.

■ Record of • Interrogation of Kurt Otto, Kemmerich, male of No, 4 C.I.C.,
Recklinghausen, Compound' V, carried out by H. Schweiger, Captain, Gen'
List, of War Crimes Investigation Unit at No. 4 C.I.C. between 10.00 hrs.
and 14.00 hrs. on the 14th of December 1946.
Kurt Otto Kcmmerich is informed that he is not bound to ansv;er any
questions but anything he says will be taken down in writing and may be
used in evidence.
1. I am Kurt Otto Kemmerich, born 21st Apr. 1918, of German nationality,
by profession'post-office official
(crossed out in ink and initialled: "K.K. ")
I make the following declarations voluntarily without compulsion or
persuasion and of my own free vd.ll.
Q: What was your appointment and rank in November 1945?
A: I was medical NCO (Unteroffizier) and had been posted to the "Stutzpunkt"
(Subsidiary Camp) Spaldingstrasse, Hamburg area, of Neuengamrae Camp. I was
in charge of all the medical care of the "Stutzpunkt" and it's branches.
We had been appointed to deputise for the "StanGortarzt" (garrison M.0.)
NEUENGAMME, Hauptsturmfuhrer TSCHIBINSKY'. • I myself had to supervise 20
doctors, chosen from among the prisoners. The "Revier" (sick-quarters) of
Basel XZ was one of the branches belonging to my district. The prisoner-
doctor there was a Czech Jewess, I do not remember her name.
Q: Were you addressed as Scharfuhrer?
A: Only after Christmas 1944 we were addressed as such.
We had.not been told if that meant that we belonged to the SS then.
We also wore;the 'death's head" ensign, but under the national emblem of
the Army under the cap. At the left side of the collar we: wore the swastika
SS sign (Runen hakenkreuz).
Q: How could you carry out this medical job?
A: I had received medical (training with the voluntary fire brigade as well
as with the Army. Moreover I taught myself by books and from questions I
put to the prisoner-doctors. I also had been sent to Neuengamme to become
acquainted with the medical work in the camp. I stayed there for 4 weeks.
This was about August/September 1944. ■
Q: What was the opinion of the above mentioned prisoner-doctors of your
medical experience?
A: They were satisfied.
Q: Did you independently give orders with regard to medical treatments?
A:	In	smaller	cases I gave	orders personally. I was furthermore in charge
of	the	medical	supplies and	the hygiene in the camp.
Q: Do you remember Helene TZYMALKOWSKA, a Polish Jewish prisoner at Sasel
Camp?
A: I cannot remember the name.
Q: Do you remember a prisoner who allegedly became mad?
A: - Yes. :
Q: When I saw you yesterday and asked you for the first time, why this
prisoner was murdered, did you fall sick''and start rolling your eyes
immediately after this question?
A:	It	is right	that I felt	sick and perspirated. I had just returned	from
my	work. This	happened not	immediately after your question, but later	on
/during﻿f

•
during further interrogation. It was caused through the bad air in the room,.
Q: bo you intend to stick to that answer in this your statement on .oath,-
although I inform you again that you did not fall sick later during further
interrogation, hut immediately after I had put above question to you?
11: Yes.
Q: Then my own statement on hand' of my notes from yesterday and personal
memory that you fell sick immediately after that question concerning the
murder of the TZYEiiLKOWSKA are not the truth?
-A: I cannot say this, I felt already giddy before that moment therefore I
cannot remember when exactly it started.
Q: Is it right that I called immediately for the Camp doctor- who thoroughly
examined you?
h: Yes. You called immediately for the doctor but it lasted ten to fifteen
minutes before he arrived.
Q: What did he ascertain?
A: That T was covered with sweat. I cannot say what else he said as he wrote
a certificate which he signed and 1 saw that you enclosed this into your
file (enclosed as exhibit "B").
Q: Do you want to say something?
h: Yes. I want to say, that I expected a better treatment for me instead of
being interned in an internment camp, as I always treated the prisoners
humanly, in fact as the proverb says (a German preverb)': "I blew their behinds
up with sugar of' grapes.’"
Q: What happened to Tzymalkowska?
A: I was phoned up from BASEL camp I do not know by whom- and was told that
a Jewess has gone mad. I said, they should give her one tablet of luminal
daily to calm her. I wanted that she rested to become normal again.
Q: Lid you vist the patient yourself?
A: I was phoned up by the Aufsehrin Eberstein who told me that the paiient
was shouting loudly and upsetting'the whole camp. Therefore I went to the
SASEL sick-quarters two days after the first telephone call.
Q» In what condition did you find the patient and who else was present?
A: The patient was alone in the room. Her hands had been tied. I cannot
remember whether her feet had been tied- too. Elastic bandages had been used
for that purpose. She behaved very impatient. The female prisoner-doctor,
EBERSTEIN, and two Jewish nurses were present. I do not remember exactly
whether STARK was also present. It is possible that the Kapo Andree van
STEEItBERG-EN came with me. He was an experienced medical orderly. His
address is Brussels, Rue Lonis, Masae 18.
Q: In which way did the patient behave ’’impatient”?
A: She shouted: "Doctor you will help me the others will only poisen me".
She glared at me and cried. She only would be touched by the Jewish nurse
or me. I sat at the side of the bed, she seized my hand and said: "Doctor
you are good".
Q: How was she able to do this with her hands tied?
A: This was possible because her hands were tied to the side -of the bed.
Q: What orders did you give?
A: I ordered to loosen her hands and to put her into .a straight-jacket,
so that she could not injure herself. This order was not executed before I
left.
/Q: Why﻿-3-

'4: Why should she injure herself?	,
A:	I assumed this because she was so impatient and had already broken up
furniture of one room. I had seen also a mad prisoner at Neuengarame who had
injured hirself.
Q:' What was your diagnosis?
A: I ascertained that she was mentally insane. Her physical conoition was
satisfying. Jn fact she was less emaciated than the prisoners of Basel
generally were. She was "well covered with fat all over". The female doctor
told me, that she had a strong heart.
Q: Did the patient insult the Nazis?
A: Not in my presence.
Q: Did you prescribe anything?
A: Yes,' I told the female doctor to give her one tablet of luminal daily
and asked for a special nurse to guard her. Furthermore I told the female
doctor that I would telephone the Standortarzt NEUENGAMME.
Q: Why?
1.: Because the female doctor had no experience in these matters. Furthermore
I did not want to carry such a responsibility myself as in consequence of the
tied hands a blood-stagnation would be caused which could affect the heart
of the patient and kill her.
Q: How was it then possible, that the patient with her hands tied in such a
manner could seize your hands?
il: She was not bound as tight as all that, there was space left.
Q: Then why should there occur a blood-stagnation?
A:	She was not bound too tightly, but in unguarded moments the patient might
have stemmed herself against the binding.
Q: Then what actual sense was there in this phone-call as you yourself had
ordered already a straight-jacket instead of the binding, or is it not
perhaps nearer to the truth that you did not phone up the Standortarzt at all-
A: Yes, I did phone up, in order to ask his advice.
Q: Yfas this ordinary procedure, to call up the Standortarzt because of a
prisoner-patient?	^
A: Yes, even because of single patients, if we did not know what to ao.
This had been ordered by the Standortarzt.
Q: What were then the instructions of the Standortarzt; ahd when did you
phone him up?
A: I phoned to him immediately after I left SnSEL-camp and he ordered to
put the patient into a straight-jacket. He then listened to my report and
ordered to give the patient three times daily luminal tablets and later on,,,
if these should not help, one to two cubic-cm morphine daily. He asked me.
about the strength of our morphine and I gave him the numbers.
Q: What were these numbers?
A: I do not know exactly, I believe 0,002.
Q: Does there really exist in Germany a weak solution of that kind, or is
not the weakest solution in use 0.02 per cubic-cm ampule?
A:	I believe there is a weak solution of that kind in use. You can make
enquiries at the "ELEPHANTENAPOTHEICE" in HAMBURG-BAHMBECK from where^I got
my ampules.
Q: fas it your opinion, that the Standortarzt prescribed too large a quantity;
A: As I never had worked with morphine I did not know that.
/Q: What﻿f
Q: What did you do then?
A: I passed !the' order by phone immediately on to the female doctor.
Q: What did the female doctor say?
A: She mentioned that it was a rather large quantity, but I answered that
those- were the prescriptions of the Standortarzt a.nd that he must be right.
Q: What happened - further?' ■
■is On the second or third day after my .first visit EBEliSTEIN called on me
and told me that the patient was calmer- and sleeping. I said, so that we yet
are going to win and the patient will be all right again. I was very much
relieved, that the patient felt better.
Q: Did you now order any restruotions with regard to the ordered prescriptions
especially in respect 'to the morphine?
A• No, I thought I could reply in that respect on the female doctor.
Q: Did you pay another visit to the patient?
-u: Approximately the 5th, or the 6th, or the 7th day after my first visit I
saw the patient again.
Q: What did you see and who else was present?
A: She-was not tied any iliore. She made a quiet and sleepy impression,
physically she was hardly changed, I want to say hardly emaciated. The female
doctor and two Jewish nurses were also x^resent, probably I came again with
the Kapo VAN STEENBERG-EN.
Q: What did you-say to the female doctor?
A: Thank God, we are going to win, I think we can stop with the morphine.
Q: That is to say that the female doctor did continue to administer morphine
after the a/m visit of EBEfiSTEIN to you and her report that the patient was
calmer?
A: That I do not know.
Q: Then why did you say to the female doctor on this visit to 'the sick -
quarters, to stop with morphine for the future?
A:	I was under the impression, that she had continued to administer morphine.
Q: So then in spite of all you were of the opinion that the patient still
received'morphine from the female doctor even after the report of EBERSTEIN
to you several days before this your visit to the sick-quarters?
A: Accordingly yes, because of the sleepy looks of the patient. Moreover
I had supplied the female doctor with a complete package of ten ampules and I
remember that the Eberstein fetched a second complete package from me for the
female doctor and before my second visit to the side-quarters.
Q; Did you therefore reproach the female doctor that the patient still
received morphine although she was calmer?
A: No,
Q: But what did you then think did the Standortarzt mean with his
prescription in his alleged order, when he said to administer morphine only
"later on"?
A: I understood, he meant, if the state of the patient should'deteriorate
and she should not become calm by luminal.
Q: Arid’now, although the patient had become calmer she still.received morphine,
and nevertheless' you did not reproach the female doctor?
A: Yes, because I only was the medical orderly and she was the doctor with the
greater experience. I never gave: orders about use of medicaments, except not
to waste them.	'
/A: Yes,
Q: Wer® you the superior to the female doctor?﻿t
”A: Yes, I had the authority to give orders, and could issue instructions to
the female doctor which she was bound to obey. But she did not always
obey my orders*
Q: Shat happened with Concentration Camp prisoners who did not obey orders
of their camp officials?
A: Neuengamme had to be informed about him. That meant that he personally
had to report to Neuengamme. I do not know- what happened there with him then,
but when. I was at NSUEMbJvME, prisoners were always treated v/ell there, .and
I also never reported the female doctor.
■Q: And though you vrere "only the medical orderly", you now on your second
visit to the Sasel sick-quarters did issue the order to the female doctor,
to stop with the morphine?
A: I said: "I believe we can stop-with morphine novr and start to give her
light food again".
Q: Then why did you not send these instructions for the female doctor at
once, when EBERSTEIN reported several days earlier to you that'the patient
was' calmer?
A': Because I could reply on the Jewish nurse, who was very efficient, the
female doctor'had told me. She had great knowledge and was on absolutely
trustworthy personality.
Q: You said before: "start to give her light food again",. what food had she
then received up to that moment?
A:	During the first time	the	patient refused	to take any food at	all.	I	do
not	know, if she later on	ate	the light food.	In my presence she	ate nothing.
I prescribed grape-sugar.
Q:	Did you see the food of the Jewish nurse beside the patient's	bed?
A:	No, I did not. I did	see	a cup of coffee	beside the .bed.
Q: Did you hear the patient cry for something to eat because of hunger?
A: She did not cry in my presence.
Q: What were the further happenings?
A: Some days later - it is right that .1 thought yesterday it was one to two
days later, today I think it was four to five days later, an exact number I
cannot state at all - it was reported to me that the patient had died.
Q: What was your opinion ..when you heard this?
A: That the patient had died of poisoning with luminal and morphine and of
physical weakness.
Q: How is it possible that death caused by physical weakness could occur so
shortly after your second visit at BASEL sick-quarters when at the time of
that visit you found the patient "hardly emaciated"?
A: Because a human body does not loose flesh so quickly, that one can
notice this decay already such a short time before the day of "death by
physical weakness"; and further, because of her not taking any food, her
body could not stand the effects of luminal and morphine. Already during my
first visit of the patient the EBERSTEIN reported to me, that the patient
'refuses to take food.
Q: If this was reported to you, then why did you permit the female doctor
inspite of this circumstances that patient refused from start to take food,
to administer luminal- and morphine?
A: I had reported this to the Standortarzt, but he said, as soon as she will
be calmer, she will start to eat again.
Q: If'it was known to you, that the human body cannot stand the effects of
luminal and morphine without taking good at the same time, why did you not
convince yourself personally, that the patient took food at the same time?
A: I could not do this, as my district was too large.'
/Q:- How﻿f
Q: How could you have felt so sure, that the doctor and nurses , ave food to
the patient, when you said during your second visit to the female doctor:
"Now we can start to.give her light food again" - dr did you not say this
because you were fully aware that t he patient did not have had any food up
to that moment?
A: I wanted to say with this,' that the patient had not taken any food up
to that moment of which I was aware as it,had been reported to me,
Q: When?
A: This had already been reported to me on my first visit to the patient,
Q: Then you were aware of this already since then?
A: Yes, as it has been reported to me.
Q: So you were aware of the fact, that the patient did not take any food,
and you were 'aware, that she took luminal and morphine?
A: I know, that I passed on the instructions to the female doctor, to
administer luminal and morphium, I do not know if the doctor obeyed this
instruction. Only at the moment of the death of the prisoner it beca.me clear
to me, that this was a case 'of poisoning effected by luminal and morphine
without taking food at the same time,
Q: Or is it not better to say, that you intended to murder the patient in
that way?
A: No, I did not intend to murder her,
Q: Then who did poison the patient, the female doctor?
A: No, she only administered the luminal and morphine.
Q: Then was it the Standortarzt?
A: Yes, by the instructions he gave me and which I passed on. I myself
believed the patient would recover.
Q: Did the Standortarzt intend to kill her?
A: I cannot answer this question, to me he did not say anything about this.
Q: Where is he at present?
A: Hauptsturmfu Tschibins (l do not know the right way of spelling his name)
is said to have been arrested in HAMBURG-.
Q: Is it known to you, that even "full-blooded" Germans were killed by 'the-
Nazi if they considerea them to be mad?
A: I have heard about that.
Q: Do you believe that Polish concentration camp prisoners were treated
better in that case? ’	.	„	.
A: Do you mean to say if the prisoners concerned were just Polish or also
Jewish? :	,
Q: Let us say in case of Jewish prisoners?
A: In that case’ 1 hardly believe so. I am convinced, that if the patient
would have been sent away from SASSL, that she would have been killed then.
As she was a very good worker, we tried to keep her.
'Q:	How do you explain, that you stated in the beginning of this interrogation
that your reason for phoning up the Standortarzt was,'that-you did not want
to carry on yourself the responsibility of her eventual death.'- According
to above no such responsibility excisted when a man Jewish prisoner was
concerned?
A: I meant the responsibility I would have to carry in the presence of God.
Q: But if this responsibility did not exist towards your superior, on the
contrary those superior authorities intended to kill mad prisoners, why did
you call up in that case just this superior?
A: I asked the superior, -not to take the-usual measures in that case, in
order to -save the patient.
/Q: But﻿Q: But the result was that the patient died?
A: The patient died in spite of this.
Q: And in your own opinion she died because of having been poisoned?
A: In my opinion she must have been poisoned.
Q:	I am going to read to you now the statement made by a witness?
(Deposition Glaser No. 1 is read out to KEMVCEIICH)
A: All this is not true.
Q: I have to point out to you that the witness who made this statement is the
same nurse, you yourself called a most trustworthy person?.
A: Then this Jewess is lying.
Q: And for wat reasons?
A: She wants to put the blame on me in the same way, as the whole of the
German People is blamed now. for the shameful crimes of the concentration
camps. Of these crimes I know only now, after having read about it in the
newspapers. It further must be an act of revenge on her part.
Q: An act of revenge for what?
A: This nurse has no personal reason for that. The nurse I mean has a
squint.
Q: I am going to read out to you some other depositions of witnesses?
(Dep Nos. 1, 2 and 3)
A: It is all lies. Especially it is untrue that the patient was afraid of
me, or that I myself administered an injection of morphine.
Q: So that is to say, that all the witnesses are lying only you are taling
the truth?
A: They are trying to put the blame on me, in order to get acquitted
themselves. And furthermore, I do not believe at all, that the witnesses
actually did make all the statements you read out to me.
Q: Would you believe it, if I show you their signatures?
A: When the witnesses actually make these statements then they are lying.
I wish to give also names of my own witnesses.
Q: Who are they?
A: Van STEENBERGEN is one. Further Professor GOUINAUD of AHGENTAN, GENE,
FRANCE. Also Dr. GOLD, BRUENN, 13, EROENEN; and MARIANNE THIELE, PRAGUE.
Professor GOUINAUD has sent a letter to my wife a copy of which I would like
to have enclosed with the file (Enclosed Exhibit "C"), the original of which
should be at the camp office.
Q: Is the original written in French or German?
A: I do not know.
Q:	I am just informed by the camp office that this original is not there?
j'i: Then it has been left with another authority.
Q: "Were the above named witnesses all present at BASEL sick-quarters?
A: Only perhaps Van STEENBERG, but not the others.
Q: Would you like to have thos persons, who were present as witnesses?
A: Certainly.
Q: I am going to read out to you a statement made by EBERSTEIN about your
medical knowledge? (Deposition EBERSTEIN No, 2/s)
A: Yes, it is my belief also, that I was just as capable as the female
doctor. In some matters my own knowledge was far above the knowledge of the
female doctor.
Q: Do you want to add anything to your statement?
/A: I﻿#
A: I want to ask, that the owner of the two drugstores in Hamburg, i.e. :
ELEPItiSlTBMPOTHERE I-pilVtBURG-B^BICBECK and IklTHPUS^POTIIElvE HiMBUBG, will be
present at my trial as I,bought the medicaments there; and also Mr. HEHLER
and Mr. BIlilNDT should be called, both HAMBURG, who assisted me when I bought
medicaments.	.
Q: Is there anything else you want to add?
A: No.
(IN handwriting by ink): I wish further to'add, that my profession is not
post-office official, but forest-offici: 1.

1.	Ich bin Ustera Glaser, go boron am 1 < 'i. 191 o, Krankensthwester, jii-
dischcr KoJivfession staatenlos,
Ich verstehe und lose flirssend deutsch and um daher boreit, meine Aus-
sage in Deutsch abijulegen.
2.	Ich war von i.nfang 1944 bis Marz 1945 Haftling des KZ. Sasel und
als Oberschivester im Rovrer dos K.Z, Sasel tatig. Ein anderer Haftling,
Dr. Bartany, welche in Belsen erschossen wurde, war als Arztin tatig.
Meine unmittelbare Vorgesetzte im Revier war dil:: Ursula Eberstoin, und
diese war dem Sanitater Kemmerich verantwortlich, welcher als Doctor auf-
trat.
^ntG	wur(^e Qinos Tages die Helene DZymalkowska, ein polni-
scher Haftling jud. Konf,, von der Baustelle ins Revier gebracht, weil
sie an der Baustelle geschlagen worden war, und daher aus den Munde blu-
tete und Kopfschmerzen hatte. Tzymalkoivaka war sehr gesunder und krafti-
ger Natur hatte nie vorher irgondwelche. e —^liche Behandlung ndtig und
hatte eine bokannt kraftise C wane'sXJ'”- .
4.	In der folgenden Nacht fing sie je.dooh im	zu toben an, und
als ich sie su boruliigen yersuchte, sagtc sie nir, sie muesse sich einmal
uber ihro Gcf'ihle gegon die Nazi gehon lassen. Dor larm lockte auch dout-
sches Personal herein, damn tor die Eberstein, und diese lachten und stell-
ten fost, sio soi vorruokt. Nachsten Tag ging die Eberstein zum Kenmerioh
um ihm den Vorgang zu r.elden,
Kenmorich oosuchte daraufhm un er Revier, or kam allein. Wahrend
soiner Untersuchung dor Tzymalkowska waren anwosend: Dr, Bartanyi, Eber-
stein, Oberschariu, Stark, Zollseer-otar Paasch,. Aufseherin Muller und ich.
Ich war wahrend dor ganzen Zcit anwesonr und hbrte jedes Wort. Kemmerich
seltzte sich zur Patientin und sagte ihr, sie simuliere. Daraufhin begann
die Patlentin die Dsutschen zu beschimpfen. Kemmerich sagte, : “Wir wer-
den mit Tzymalkowska senon fertig werden'1, Wir alle gingen vom Kranken-
bett weg zum Penater, ich wies Kemmerich daraufhin dass es koine reine
Simulation soi, da ich Angst hatte, Kenmcrich werde ihr sonst sofort etwas
un, und Kommerich antwortoto nir: "Kumrern sie sich nicht selbst, die wird
krepiercn, sowas kann man. in Lager nicht haben." Dann gab er der Eberstei^
foagende Anweisungon, die ich selbst horte: "Jeden Tag fiir Dzymalkowska
erne Spntze mit 2 cubic cm Morphiun, sowie 5 Tabletten Luminal." Er fiigte
hmzu: "Sollte sich aber ihr Herz Is zu stark erweisen, so werden wir die
Dosen noch verstarhen." Er ordnete an, dass ihm die Eberstein taglich Be-
richt erstatten solle iiber den Eortschritt des Krafteverfalles und erklar-
te ihr: "ffonn Du slohct, dass sie von Tag zu Tag schwacher wird, dass die
Augen nicht mohr sehen kennen. dann 1st der Verlauf gut, dann stirbt sie.
v/enn sie jedoch, da sie nun so kraftig 1st, wieder agressiv wird, dann kom-
me ich nochmals soloet." Nun beauftragte mich Kemmerlich, die Spritzc fiir
ihn mit zwei Ampulen, zusammen 2 cubic ora.Morphiun zu fallen, was ich durch-
fuhrto. Ich uberreichte ihm die Spritze und er wollte die Injektion selbst
emfuhren, doch die Patientin wehrte sich zu stark und sohrie: "Ich weiss
das ist eine Todesspritze," Nan ordnete Ke-erioh den deutschen Personal an,
is Patientin zu halten, und ich mueste diese mit einem Stuck Watte mit
Chlor athyl auf uer Naso betauben. Kommorioh fiihrte dann die Spritze ein.
6, Einigc Tagc spater kam Kemm.ruoh wieder ins Revier und besuchte die
Tzymalkowska, welche noch immor ganz kraftig war und welter die Nazi be-
schimpfto. Ich war	wahrend der ;anzon Zeit seines Bosuohes anwesend.
/Naohdem﻿2
#
Nachdem Kemaerioh die Patientin angeaehen hatte, ging er mit uns weg vom
krankenbett und sagte: "Donnerwetter, die hat doch ein Herz von Eison, man
darf ihr nichts zu fresscn und zu trinkon geben". Waiters erhohte er die
Morphium dosis per Tag von 2 auf 3 cubic cm. Stark, Eberstein und ich be-
gleiteten dann Konmerich zum camp ausgang und Stark sagte zu Kemmerich in
meiner Anwesenheit: "Da hast Du Dich aber blamiert, Doctor, die lebt noch
imner und macht so einen Wirbol im lager" Kemmerich antwortete: "O-Schar,
habe keine Angst, die krepiert doch! Ich kann nichts dafiir, dass sie so
ein starkes Herz hat." Kemmerich sagte auch, man sollo auf mich aufpassen,
dass ich nicht von neinsm Essen der Patientin gebo, da ich doch "eine
barmherzige Schwester" sei.
7.	Tatsachlich v/urden alle Anordnungen des Kemmerich durchgefiihrt, die
Spritzen gab die Arztin, Luminal gab die Eberstoin und sagte es sei Vita-
min. Drei odor 4 Tage spater kam Kemmerich nochmals und ordnete in meiner
Anwesenheit an, dass die Patientin mit Draht an Handen und Fiissen gebunden
werde, v^eil diese noch imner unruhig war. Ich versuchte der Patientin ein-
nal von meinen Essen zu geben, wurde aber dabci von Kemmerich erwischt,
well er das Esse'n neben dera Bett stehen sah, und drohte er mir mit der Gas-
ko.miaer. Kemnerich besuchte die■ Patientin einige Male.
8*	Nach den zweiten Besuch Kemmerichs verfiel dann die Patientin zuse-
hends, ihre Hautkorperfarbe wurde schwar.z, sie magerte vollig ab und wurde
dann bewusstlos. Ca nach ziyei Wochen nach ihrer Einlieferung starh sie an
Herzschwache. Als Kommerich dann in neiner Anwesenheit im Rcvier gemeldet
wurde, dass die Tzymalkowska tot sei, sagte er zu Stark: "Also sohade, dass
wir keine Wette gemacht haben, sonst hatte ich gewonnen."
9.	Ich bin Krankenschwester von Beruf mit 14 jahriger Praxis, und es
ist auf Grund meiner beruflichen Kenntnis meine absolute Uberzeugung, dass
die Tzymalkowska bci Einlioferung ins Reyier korporlich vollig gesund war
ausser leichton Verletzungen durch Schlagen, und nur lurch die bewusst tot-
liche Behandlung durch Morphiun und luminal seitens Kemmerich's vergiftet
wurde.

1.	Ich bin Ursula Eberstein, goboron am 22,11,1922, Verkaufcrin,
Deutsch.
Anfang bis Mitte November 1944, zur Zeit des Todes der Holla Dzymalkowska
war ich Aufseherin in Arbeitslager Sasel.
2.	Kemnerich Kurt war damals Letter des Sanitatsroviers im Stiitzpunkt
Hamburg, Sein Vorgesotzter war Hauptsturnfu Dr. Tyibinsky in Neuengamme,
Kemmerich war vorantwortlich fuer die Sanitaetsreviero dor Aussonlager des
Stutzpunktes, dr.runter Sasel.
3.	Ich selbst war verantwortlich fuer die Medikamentenbestcllung und
Sauborkeit des Sassel Reviers, doch arbeitete ich tagsueber im Aussendicnst.
Di'e medizinische Leitung dieses Reviers lag in den Haenden eines Haeftlings,
Dr, Irene Bartany, welche spaeter 1945 in Belsen erschossen wurde. Sowohl
ich wie Dr. Bartani unterstanden direkt Kemmerich, Kemmerieh bosuchte un-
ser Revier ca alle 4 Wochen und dann mussten wir ihn Bericht erstatten,
Kemmerich nahm manchmal, wenn dringende Paella vorlagen, einon Arzt mit,
gewohnlich einen franzosischen Haeftling aus der Spaldingsrasee* dor Pro-
fessor (Chirurg) war. Ich weiss nicht wo sich dieser heute befindet, er
erzaehlto mir, dass er oine eigene Clinik in Paris hatte und dort verhaftet
wurde, weil er deutschen Soldaten Behandlung verweigert hatto. Ich weiss
nur, dass er 1945 nach Ausschwitz als Arzt geschickt wurde,
4'*	Obersturmfu j'iedenann war allgemeiner Vorgosetzter Kemmerichs, in
seinor Eigenschaft als Stutzpunktleitor Spaldingstrasse, doch hatte mit dem
Rcvior nichts naeher zu tun.
5• Hella Dzymalkowska wurde November 1944 ins Sasel Revier eingeliefert,
weil sie wirr sprach und einon geistig verstorten Eindruck machte. Kbrper-
lich war sio vollig riistig und gesundhoitlich hatto ihr nichts gefehlt.
Ein odor swci Tago darauf hatte sie nachts oinon Anfall, tobte und schrio,
Sowohl ich als dio Aerztin narnen daher a,n, dass sie geistig gestoert sei.
Da ich jeden Tag zum Stiitzpunkt gehen musste, suchte ich naechston Tag dort
Kemmorich auf, urn ihn darueber zu berichten und um ihn urn eino Spritze zu
bitten, da ihr die Arztin cin Beruhigungsmittel geben wollte. Darauf sagte
Kemmorich zu mir: "Ach was Spritze fuer eine Vorriickte, schiesst ihr dooh
einc Kugol in den Kopf!"
6.	Sowohl mir wie Kemmerich war es absolut bekannt, dass die Routine-
politik der SS darin lag, Haeftlinge die nicht arbeitsfaohig waren, zu to-
ten. Insbesondere Kemmerich wusste dies, da er einige Zeit in Ausschwitz
gewesen war. Von Neuengamme bestand auch die Anordnung dass alle jene
Haeftlinge, welche voraussiohtlich laenger a.ls 4 Wochen krank sein wiirden,
nach Neuengamme zu melden sind, um nach Neuengamme transportiert zuwerden.
Es war fuer joden klar, dass sie dort getotet wurden. So ein Transport war
mit vlel Schreibereien etc, fuer Kemmerich verbunden, Ich hatte daher schon
danals, als ich ihn besuchte, das sichere Gufuehl, dass er die Absicht habe
sich diese Scherereien zu ersparen. Aue-^u^^lioh gesagt hatte er dies nicht,
aber ich schloss dies aus seinem Ansorue*'' mit der "Kugol durch den Kopf".
Dies war leicht fuer ihn, da er die Befugnis hatto mit den kranken Haeftlin-
gen zu machen was er wollte. Dies woiss ich, wcil ich die von ihm ausge.—
stellten Totonzettel sah und bomerkte, dass er diese ganz willkurlich aus-
fullte. Um den Transport nach Neuengammo zu vermeiden fiel cs ihm daher
loicht, sio schon vor hor um die Ecke zu bringen,
7,	Am naochston tag nach meiner Meldung zu Kemmerich erschion or solbst
im Revier Sasol mit dem franzosischon Professor, Beido untersuchton die
Patientin. Kemmerich sagte, sie simuliere, worauf sio Hitler und die Nazi
zu beschimpfen anfi.ng. Dor Professor stollte fest, dass sie Nervonkrank sei,
/Daraufhin ......﻿2
Daraufhin versohriob Kemmerich die- "Kur". Obwohl er dies nicht ausdruok-
lioh sagte, da os gofahrlich. 1st in K.Z's effen zu sprechen, war os ganz
offonsichtlich, dass er beabsichtigte, die Dzymalkowska mit einer zu star-
ken Kur zu toten. Ich hbrte, wio er Morphium und luminal nannte, kann mich
aber an die Boson nicht crinnern, Dass er bewusst cine zu starke, tbtliehe
Kur verschrieb sah ich aus den entsetzton Gesichtsminen der Aerztin und dcs
Professors. Es war den Gesichtsausdruck dicscr beiden klar zu entnehmen,
dass die Tbtungsabsicht Kenmorichs nit dieser Kur klar auflag. Weiter ord-
nete Kommerich an, dass die Pationtin auf halbe Rationen zu setzen soi, was
im K.Z, ausserst wenig bedeutote. Von halben Rationen hatte nan nicht 1c-
ben kbnnen, es sei denn viellcicht wenn man im Bett lag, Kemmerich sagte
zu rnir: "Wozu die Verriickte noch unniitz maessten, sie ist sowieso viel zu
stark vriirde dadurch dann noch mchr schreion; und das wurde doch die "Kur"
nur verlangern." Es war ganz klar, dass er neinte "das leben verlangern",
Ich hielt mich aber nicht damn und gab ihr selber zu essen.
S.	Am nacchsten Tag kldrte mich die iirztin dahin auf, dass luminal zwar
ein Beruhigungsmittcl sei, aber in so starker Dosis, wie der Paticntin
durch Kemmerich verschricben, unbedingt totlich sei. Keamerich kannte sich
ganz genau mit Luminal und Morphium aus, und wusste, dass diese Dosis tot-
lich sei, welche er verschrieben hatte. Er war auf medizinischem Gebiet
sehr gut bewandert.
9.	Auch die Patientin war der Meinung, dass Kemmerich sie erledigen
wolle, da sie inner schreckliche Angst vor ilim hatte, und die von ihm vor-
geschriobene Kur nicht nehnen wollte. Dio Aerztin hatte daher selbst ver-
fugt, d^'.ss Dzymalkowska anzubinden sei um KeiIi^lerich, s Verordnungen clurchzu—
ftihren. Dies geschah zuerst mit einem Band, und als dieses riss, mit Iso—
lierten Draht. Ich habe sie selbst gebunden gesehen und als es nach drei
Tagen wund wurdc, ordnete ich die Arztin an, es zu Cntfernen,
10.	Raohcrcs ubor die von Kemmerich vorgoschriebene Kur ist mir nicht
bekannt. Dio Arztin vorabroichto die Kur, und das erste Mai gab Kemmerich
selbst ihr eine Injoktion. Ich gab der Paticntin nur einmal Pillen, von
denon dio Arztin nir sagte, os soi Vitamin, und von denen ich selbst eine *
nahm, Ich weiso, dass dio Arztin ihr auch Luminaltabletton, wie von Kom-
merich vorsohrioben, cingab, ich war aber nie dabci,
11.	j.ls Kemmerich ca 8 Tago spater wieder im Revior war, sah er sich
nooh einmal dio Patientin an. Anscheinond war er mit dem Fortschritt des
Verfalios nicht zufrieden. Ob er die "Kur" weiter vorstaerkte, weiss ich
nicht, aber als ich ihm tags darauf clienstlich im Stiitzpunkt sah, sagte erj
"Na, was nacht denn Eure Verriickte, ist sio schon tot?" Als ich dies ver-
neinte fragtc er weiter: "Ja bekommt sio denn ihre Spritzen?" Ich crzahlte
ihm, dass nir dio Arztin erzahlt habe, dio Paticntin wolle die Injektionon
nicht nehmen, worauf er antwortete: "Sage der Arztin, sie solle unter alien
Umst§.ndon die Spritzen geben, sonst kommo ich sclber und gib ihr mal eine
ordentliche Spritze sclbst." Ich woiss nicht, warum Kemmerich dies alios
fragte, nachdem er am Tags vorher selbst im Revier gewesen war, es ist mog-
lich, dass er am Tage vorher tatsaechlich eine starke Verstarkung der Dosis
angeordnet hatte, und cleshalb sich nachston Tag erkundigte,
12.	Drei wochen nach dem Beginn der von Kemmerich verschriebenen Kur
starb die Dzymalkowska. Todesursache war Herzschwache infolge der Kur, die
letzten Tage war sie bereits bewusstlos.
^5* Es ist meine voile Uberzeugung, dass Kommerich's Kur sie getotet hat,
Alo eie auf1s Revier eingeliefert wurde, war sie korporlioh besonders stark.
Nach Beginn Kemmerich's Kur, insbesondero na,ch seincm zweiten Bcsuch ver-
fiel sie buchstablich und schnell von Tag zu Tag und hungerte schrecklich.
Die Veranderung ihros Kbrperzustandes innorhalb von 3 Wochen war grauener-
regend.
14. tiber andere ahnlicho Fallo scitens Kemmerich ist mir nichts bokannt,
Ich glaube, or verlioss Hamburg im Fobruar 1945,

Erganzung,
Ich, Ursula Efcerstein, vriinscho nach Durchleson meiner Angaben folgendes
zu Punkt 13. "hungerte schrscklich'' zu erganzen: Damit wollte ich ange-
bon, dass sie schrecklich gehungert hatte, wenn sie bloss die halben
Portionen bekonmen hatte. Ich habe ihr aber trotz Kemmerich's Anordnung
zu essen gegeben, und ihr Hunger war daher nicht so stark. Ueberhaupt
hat sie nach den zweiten Besuch Kemmerichs nichts mehr zum Essen verlangt,
sondern lag ganz aphatisch.

DEPOSITION
Of
Leonhard Stark.
Deposition on oath of Leonhard Stark, male, of Strafgefangnis Fuhlsbtittel,
sworn before Hf Sohweiger, Captain, Gen, List, of War Crime Investigation
Unit at Fuhlsbuttel, on the Sixth Day of December 1946.
It Ich bin Leonhard Stark, geboren 30. 9. 91, Gartner, Deutsch,
Am 1, November 1944 habe ich das Lager Sasol als Lagerfiihrer ubernommen,
Das Rovier gohorte zwar zum Lager, aber ich konnte dort keine Anordnungon
troffen. Der Verantwortliche furs Rovior war Kommorich. Kemmerich hatte
nicht oinmal zu mir zu meldcn, sondern hatte einon Ausweis von Nouengamme,
wolcher ihn ermachtigto jedorzeit das Lager zu botreten. Ein Haftling war
im Rovior als Arztin cingesetzt, und diose Arztin moldcto mir jodon morgen
die Anzahl der Patienten,
2.	Zur Zeit als ich ins Lager Sasel kam, war die Helone Dzymalkowska
boreits im Revier. Stellvertrctender Lagerfiihrer Paasch erzahlte mir dies
und sagte mir auch, dass diose verriickt sei und auf Hitler und die Nazi
schimpfe, Dann meldete mir Paasch, dass der Sanitater Kemmerich da sei,
um die Vcrruckte anzusehen und da ging ich ebonfalls ins Revier. Dies war
erste Tage November.
3.	Als ich ins Rovier kam, und das Zimmer der Patientin betrat, war
dort Kemmerich, dor franzosische Professor, Eberstoin glaublich die Muller,
die Aerztin und die Glaser Oder die Lovi, Als ich kam, war die Untersu-
chung schon vorbei, und es wurde mir gesagt, dass die Dzymalkowska verriickt
sei. Dann wendete sich Kemmerich an die Arztin und verschriob einc Mor-
phiun kur, Als Kemmorich dies tat, hatte ich don Eindruck, obwohl or dies
nicht wbrtlich sagto, dass er mit dor Kur die Absicht habe, die Patientin
zu toten, da ich dachte, dass die Anzahl dor von ihm vorgoschriebenen
Spritzen das Herz dor Pationtin lahrnen musson. Die brutalo Miene in der
Kommerich diesc "Kur" zur Aerztin vorschriob hat mich in dieser Ansicht
daboi noch bestarkt. Ich war welters noch anwosond, als daraufhin Komme^
rich dio ersto Spritzc dor Pationtin daraufhin selbst vcrabreichto. Diesc
wahrto sich, da sie grosso Angst vor Kemmerich hattc und rief nach der
Ebcrstein.
4.	Einige Tage spator hdrte ich glaublich durch dio Arztin, dass Kemrae*.
rich die erst vorgesohriebene Kur nicht stark genug war und er diese daher
nooh weitor erhbhtc. Dor Grund wurdo mit wbrtlich nicht angegoben, abor es
war oindeutig anzunohnon, dass Kemmerich das Bnde der Patientin nicht
schnell genug kam.
5.	Einigo Tage nach oben erwahnten Bcsuch Kemroerichis im Revier spra#h
Secretar Paasch zu mir und sagte: "Also wegen der Verriickten da mtissen wir
nun abwarten, wie sich Kemmerich1s Methoden auswirken, loh verstand dies
so, dass er meinte, man musso nun sehen, ob Kommerich's Methoden nun tat-
sachlich das Ende dor Verrlickten herboifuhren wurde. Sowohl ich wie Paasoh
nahmon an, dass Kommorich Methods den Tod der Pationtin beabsiehtigtc.
6.	Ca Mitte November wurde mir dann der Tod dor Patientin gemeldet. Als
Todesursache wurde Herzschwache angegebon.
7.	Mir war Kemmorich schon vorher vom Dessau-Ufor Lager bekannt, und
fiol er mir schon dort wegen seinen brutalon Methoden auf. Einzolheiten
kann ich mich nicht mehr orinnern.

loh glaube as gibt solohe, das kann in der Elephantenaphoteke Hamburg Barn-
beck, woher ioh es besorgte, naohgefpagt vrerden.
Karen sie der Ansicht, dass der stnadortarzt zuvicl vorschreibe ?
Daruebar war ioh mir nioht im klaren, habe nie mit Morphium gearbeltet.
Was taten aie also ?
loh leitete dies® Anordnung an die Arztin sofort telephoniaoh welter.
Was sagte die Arztin ?
Sie sagte, es ware etwas viol, aber ioh antwortete, das h&tt® der Standort-
arzt vorgesohrieben und der wiirde ochon rooht haben. v
Was gesohah welter ?
'll
Am 2. Oder 3. Tag naoh meinora ersten Besuoh kam die Kberstein zu mir und
sagte mir, dass die Pationtin ruhiger sei und schlafe. leh sagte, also da
werden wir dooh gewinnen und eie wird wieder geeund. loh war sehr erleieh-
tert dass es der Patientin besser ginge.
Haben sie Rinsohrankungen wegen dar vorgesohrlebonen Kur, insbesondere
Morphine angeordnot ?
I
Hein, ioh daohte, ioh kdnne dies der Arztin Uberlassen.
Haban sie die Patientin dann wieder besuoht ?
Ca am 5. Oder 6. Oder 7. Tag naoh aeinem eraten Besuoh besuohte ioh die
Patientin wieder.
Was Biihon sie ? V?er war nooh anwesend ?
Sie war nicht gebunden, sie raachte einen ruhigen und rerschlafenen Eindruok,
kdrperlioh war sie kaum verandert, d.h. kaum entkraftet. Hooh anweeend waren
die Arztin, die beiden Judisohen Sohwestsrn, vielleioht auoh der Kapo Van
steenbergen.
Was eagten sie zur Arztin ?	,
Gottseidank, wir siegen dooh, ioh glaube wir kSnnen das Morphium weglaseen.
Also hat die Arztin dooh nooh naoh dem oben erwfthnte Besuoh der Eberstein
bel ihnen und deren Bericht, dase die Patientin ruhiger sei, Morphium welter
gegeben ?
/a.: Das kann ..........
/﻿San kann ioh aioht sagen.
Warms sa^ton sie also der Arstin bai Ihren Baauoh im Ravier , das Morphiom in
Zulcunft wag ku lasaon ?
Ich war im Glauben, dass sia ihr nooh waiter JSorphiutn gab.
Also waren sie dooh der Ansioht, fiass die Patientin noeh naoh dem Berioht der
Kbaratein elnige Tage vor ihrem Besuoh im nevier von der iiratin Morphiam or-
halten hat ?
Demnaoh ja, well Patientin nooh ziemlioh eohlafrig drain sohanto. Auaoerdsm
hatte ioh Ja auch der iratin eino koiaplette Paokung rait 1o Ampullan gegeben,
auoh orinnere ioh mioh, dass die boratein nooh sine komplette Paoktng im
Auftroge der Arstin von mir geholt hatte. u.sw. vor meinem zweiten Besuoh ira
Revier.
Haben sie also der Arztin Vorwdrfe deshalb gemaoht, dass Patientin trotz dem
nie ruhiger war doch nooh Morphium bekam ?
Rein.
Ja was veretanden eie denn eigentlioh unter der angebliche Verordnung das
Standortarztes, der Patientin "ep&tern auoh Morphitira zu geben ?
.Venn ea der Patientin sohlechtor ginge and dleoe duroh luminal allein nioht
ruhiger wurde.
Run hatte die Patientin aber dooh, obwohl sie ruhiger geworden war, Morphiura
bekomiaen, and da maohten sie der Arztin keine Vorwurfe ?
Ja deshalb, well ioh dooh nur Sanlthter war, und die Arztin die grbssere
Kenntnls hatte. Zoh habe der Arztin nie im Medlkamentenverbrauoh Anordnun-
gen gegeben ea sel denn zu sparen.
Waren sie der Vorgeaetzte der Arztin f
Ja, ioh hatte Befehlsgewalt und konnte der Arztin Anordnungen geben, an denen
diese gebunden war. Aber diese kara don Anordnungen nioht immer naoh.
Was gesohah mlt einem K.Z. Hhftllng der den Anordnungen der Aufslohtsbeaaten
nioht naoh kam ?
Kff muss to dem oamp Heuengaome mit geteilt warden. 3as bedeutete dass er in
Heuengamme zura Rapport zu gehen hatte, was dabei geechah weise ioh nicht,
aber in Neuengarame sind die ntlftlinge, solange ioh dart war, gut behandelt
worden. Ich habe aber die Arztin nie reported.
Aber trotzdem sie nur Sanithter waren,> gaben bei ihrcn zweiten Besuoh im 3a-
eel Revier nun doch der Arztin die Anordnung das Morphium einzustellen ?
loh sagte: "loh glaube wir konnen das Morphium nun einstellen, und ihr wie-
der leiohte Kost geben".
'•Varum hatten sie dies also nioht gleich dor Arztin sagen lessen, als die
Eberstein ihnsn boreits einige Tags friiher laeldete, dase die Patientin ru-
higer sei ?
.fell ioh mloh auf die jtidisohe Sohwester verlassen konnte, diese war sehr
tiiohtlg, wie mir die Arztin beriohtat hatte, hatte grosses Sisson und war
eine absolute vertrauoaewiirdige Person.
31e eagten "wleder leiohte Root geben", was ftlr Kost hatte sie denn bis her
erhalten ?
/Die Patientin﻿lia Patlentin hatte die erat© Z«it die Kost gana va^eigert, ob si® spftter di«
Xeioht® Koot hahni, weies ioh nioht, in moinem Beiaein iat niohta gonommen wor-
den. Ich hatte each Traubenzuoker vorgesohrieben.
He,bon sie das Kasen der Jttdieohen Krankensohweeter noben dem Bett stehen ee~
han ?

Weil ein Kdrper nioht so schnell verfftllt, das man dies bereits kurze Zeit

3o Conduct of Investigation: -
Report of findings of No.1. War Crimes Investigation Team,
of War Crimes and atrocities by the Germans at Sasel Concentration Camp.
The investigation was based on the findings of No.1. War
Crimes Investigation Team, on the 31st October 1945, who prepared the case against
The accused in the Sasel Concentration Camp, and was further based on a letter of
Captain Olson of J.A.G, London, who prosecuted in the Sasel Concentration Camp Trial.
Evidence against the accused has been mainly re-established by
the interrogation of two of the fDimer accused in the Sasel Concentration Camp Trial,
flnri are now serving sentences in the Prison of Fuhlsbuettel, Hamburg.
Great difficulties were met in tracing the former prosecution
witnesses as they are now living at Belson-Hohne DP Camp which is entirely under
the DP's own management.
It was found out by the Mil Gov PSO of Hohne Camp that it is
impossible for him to freeze any witness at the present time.
﻿(4)
4» Narrative of Event3j-
Concentratioxx Camp Sasel was one of the minor camps belonging to the
"Stutzpunkt Spaldingstrasse" Hamburg which in itself was a subsidary
Camp of Neuengamme Concentration Camp,
In November 1944 the accused, Kimmerich, was in charge of the medical
care of the prisoners in the Stutzpunkt Spaldingstarsse and its subsidary
camps. He was further in charge of the "Revier" (Sickquarters) of Sasel
camp, S3 - Woman Ursula Sberstein (See deposition 2) was directly responsible
to Kemmerich in the Revier at Sasel, Kemmerich also had working for him in the
Revier a female doctor, a prisoxxer named doctor Bartany, a proffe^ional nurse
(Also a prisoner) Estera Glaser (See deposition l), and also another girl prisoner
named Sophie Levy, who was occupied as an auxiliary nurse. When the victim,
Helene Tzymalkowska, a Polish Jewess, was admitted into the Revier, she took
the opportunity to relieve her pent up feelings by crying and shouting her opinion
of the Nazi Regime (See deposition 1 para 4)ltearing this, the German personal!
decided that she had gone madj SS - nurse Eberstein reported this to Kemmerich.
She told him that doctor Bartany wanted to calm Tzymalkowska down by giving her
a Morphia injection, and asked Ketnmerich to lend her a syringeto give this
injection (See deposition 2 para 5). Keramerich examined the patient and decided
that she was bodly fit, and told the patient that he thought she was malingering.
At this Tzymalkowska again started to scream and abuse the Nazi Regime (See
deposition 1 para 5) 4t this Kemmerich also decided that she must be mad, "Then
Kemmerich ordered the patient a daily injection of two cubic centimetres of
Morphia and a thrice daily dose of Luminal (See deposition 2 para 7 and deposition
3 para 3) Kemmerich administered the first injection of Morphia himself. This
treatment continued during the following days, and the patient resisted so strongly
that she was bound hand and feet with insulated wire. In spite of this repeated
dose of Morphia and Luminal the patient clung to life in a surprising manner, and
her strength and resistance and willpower dissatisfied Kemmerich who ordered that
she should receive a new daily injection of three cubic centimetres of Morphia
(See deposition 1 para 6 and deposition 2 para 11 and deposition 3 para 4).
Kemmerich further ordered that no food was to be given to the patient, in order to
reduce her powers of resistance and thus make the poison more effective (See
deposition 2 para 7), When the drugs started to have more effect on the patient,
the wire bind5.ngs were removed, 4fter this strong treatment the patient rapidly
lost weight, xher s^in turned dark in colour, and she at last became unconscious
and lilterally decayed (See deposition 1 para 8 and deposition 2 para 13) About
two or three weeks after the treatment commenced, the patient died with heart
failure, undoubtedly caused by poisoning with Morphia and Luminal,
5, Character of accused and Witnesses;-•
The accused Kemmerich gives the appearence of being sly and an uneducated quackJ
he seemed during his interrogation to be confident tSU his capability in lying
his way outj during the said interrogation he contradicted himself so frequently
that it was necessary to record this interrogation in question and answer form.
The most significant pointer to his character was his act of fainting when first
confronted with the charge, obviously inorder to win time. The camp doctor was
called immediately and could not find anythinj^vfith him.
Witnesses Estera	Glaser	(See deposition	1; is a most	reliable and sensible
witness.^ proffskional nurse	with long experience, she was	subordinated to
Kemmerich for a long enough time to know him personally and to be well capable of
Judging his medical knowledge. She did not give the impression of being unduly
prejudiced against Kemmerich and has no personal grifvlance against him,
Ursula Eberstein and Leonhard Stark,although having been sentenced for their
dealings in Sasel Concentration, are still afraid that they may suffer personally
because of their connections with the crime, ^specially Stark,who is extremely
careful in his statements, but on the other hand admits to the interrogator that
he knew all about the	murder	of Tzymalkowska	but does not	dare give a statement
to thi^effefct, as he	was Camp Commandant of	Sasel and is	afraid of further
repercuTLon on his sentence, Eberstein should make a very sensible witness,

Other Persons Interviewed:-

SS - Aufseherin Muller, Otrafanstalt Fuhl shut tel ,Hamburg.
(Serving Sentence).
Customs Official, Schumann, Strafanstalt Fuhlshuttel, Hamburg,
(Serving Sentence),

Both denied knowledge of the crime,
7, Conclusions: -
It can be concluded that Kurt Otto Kexnmerich did at the end of 1944
order, and personally assisted in the murder by poisoning and starvation
of one Helene Tzymalkovvska, a Polish Jewess prisoner of Sasel Concentration
Camp,
8,	Recommendations: -
(a)	That Kemmerich be tried for committing a war crime in that he murdered
a Polish Jewess Helene Tzymalkowska at Sasel Concentration Camp at the end of
1944.
(b)	The trial should be held as early as possible because of the danger of
the sudden disappearance in the future of one of the main winesses Estera Glaser.
9.	Administration; -
(a)	Attention is drawn to enclosed letter marked'A1' of„PSQ Belsen-Hohne camp,
with reference to freezing of DP's.
(b)	Signed medical certificate marked 'A2' declaring Kemmerich to be fit for
interrogation.

Brief Besagt mix, dass dieser Unter ^ffizier im Lager Recklinghausen
intemiert ist*
Ich bin ein franzbsischer, politischex Verschleppter,welcher im Lager
Reuen-Gamme intexniert war, und ich habe dort Kurt Kemmerich gekannt,
welcher mit der tJeberwachung des Sanitatsdienstes in diesem Lager be-
treut war. Xch habe ihn dann wieder gefunden in Hamburg, wo er mit der
t)eberwachnung des San.Dienstes der Kommandos deiser Stadt betreut war.
Ich habe ihn dort wiedergefundea, da ich selbst auf Kommando nach Ham-
burg verschickt war.	t
Ich habe dort umso besser Kemmerich gekannt,als ich, seit Oktober 1944
als Chirufeh im Revier tatig war, und ich unter der direkten und kom-
pletteatlberwachung dieses Unter**Offiziers stand.
Ich erklSre bei meiner Shre, dass im Gegensatz zu den anderen SS Kem-

schleppten immer mit der grbssten laaschenfreundlichkeit behandelte.

Oftmals ging er in die Apothekea Hamburgs um M .dikamente zu holen,

es als meine Pflicht, als anstindiger Measch, einen soldaten hervor zu ]

Sir, I received a letter of the wife of Unteroffizier Kurt
KEL .RICH, (Sanitaetsdienst = Medical Department) who was
employed at KEUE3S2AMSS. I was informed that this Unteroffi-
zier is interned in the Camp KaCKLINGHAUSM.
I am a Frenchman, displaced person for political reasons,
who has been interned at MEUENGAIvME. I knew K rt KEddERICH
who was in charge of the medical Section in this camp. I met
him again in HAMBURG where he was in charge of the medical
welfare of the parties working in this town. I met him there,
as I nyself had to work in one of these parties,
I knew lOMAEKICH very well, especially as I worked in the
hospital as a surgeon since October 1944 and was under the
direct and complete supervision of this Uhteroffizier.
I state on honour that contrary to the other SS-personnel
KELi-ERIOH always behaved entirely co: rectly and always
treated the displaced persons with great humanity. He never
was brutal and I want to point out that he endeavoured to
ammeliorate the conditions for the displaced persons.
He often went into the drug-stores in Hamburg to fetch me-
dicaments which we needed urgently, I am a Frenchman and I
have been a displaced person, and learned not to like the
Germans but I think it is my duty as an honest man, to help
a soldier who in his heart remained German which was his
duty, and behaved towards the prisoners as a civilised and
good man.
I am willing to give any other information in this matter,
if necessary, and to give the names of other displaced
persons who can state the same.	*
I am. Sir,
Your respectfully

Report of finfllngs of Ko.1, far Crii .-©s Investigation Tem,
of War Crimes and atrocities By the Seisaxis at Basel Conoentration Gaiap.
The investigation was based on the findings of Ro,1• oar
Grimes Investigation Teztst} on the 31 st October 1945» prepared the ease against
fhe accused in the Saael Concentration Gang?, and was further based on a letter of.
Captain Olson of J.A.G-. London, who prosecuted in the Basel Concentration Gamp trial
Evidence against the accused has been mainly reestablished by
the interrogation of two of the former accused in the Easel Concentration Gamp Trial
and are now serving sentences in the Prison of Fuhlsbuettel, iiajaburg.
Great difficiUties were met in tracing the former prosecution
witnesses as they are now living at Belsonrtfohne DP Camp which is entirely under
the DP’s own management.
It was found out by the Mil Gov PSG of fetes Camp that it is
impossible for him to freeze any witness at the present time.﻿(4)
4.	^agratlVQ of bvertiat-
Conceatration Qsmp 8as®l was one of the minor camps belonging to the
“Stuiapumkt SpaMingstraSs®1* Hamburg vstoich in Itself was a subsidiary
Camp of Keoengame Concentration Causo,
In Mwember I9i»4 tm accused, Siramericb., was in charge of the meflioal
care of the prisoners in the Stutzpunkt Spaldingstarsse and its subsidary
camps. He was further in charge of the "Revier'’ (Sickquarters) of Sasel
camp. SS - Womai. Ursula Sberstein (See deposition 2) was directly responsible
to Keimaerich in the Revier at Basel, Xaanerioh also had working for his in the
Revier a female doctor, a prisoner named doctor dartany, a p* offesional nurse
(Also a prisoner) Esters G-laser (See deposition 1), and also another girl prisoner
named Sophie Levy, who was occupied as an auxiliary nurse. When the victim,
Helene Tsymalkowska, a Polish Jewess, was admitted into the Revier, she took
the opportunity to relieve her pent up feelings by crying and shouting her opinion
of the R a si Regime. (See deposition 1 para i*) {feeding this, tee German personeljt
decided that she had gone mad} SS - nurse Sberstein reported this to Kcimerieh.
She told him that doctor Bart any wanted to caljr. Tzymalkowska down by giving her
a Morphia injection, and asked Kemsserich to lend her a syringe to give this
injection (See d© osition 2 para 5) Keemerich examined the patient and decided
that she was bodly fit, and told the patient that he thought she was malingering,
At this Tsymslfeowska again started to scream and abuse the t.asi Regime (See
deposition 1 para 5} At this Keromerich also decided that she must be mad, ‘Then
Ksmrr.erieh ordered the patient a daily injection af ts?o cubic centimetres of
Morphia and a thrice daily dose of Luminal (See deposition 2 para 7 and. deposition
3 para 3) Kenaaerioh admisiistered the first injection of Morphia himself, fhis
treatment continued during the following days, and toe patient resisted so strongly
that she was bound hand and feet with insulated wire. In spite of this repeated
dose of Morphia and Luminal the patient clung to life in a surprising manner, and
her strength and resistance and willpower dissatisfied Kemmerioh who ordered that
she should receive a now daily injection of three cubic centimetres of Morphia
(Sec deposition 1 para 6 and deposition 2 para 11 and deposition 3 para 4-).
iiemaerich further ordered that no food was to be given to the patient, in order to
reduce her powers of resistance and thus make the poison more effective (See
deposition 2 para ?). ..hen the drugs started to have more effect on the patient,
the wire bindings were removed. After this strong treatment the patient rapidly
lost weight, her skin turned dark in colour, and she at last became unconsaio.p.s
and liltorally decayed (See deposition 1 para 8 and deposition 2 para 13) About
two or three weeks after the treatment commenced, the patient died with heart
failure, undoubtedly caused by poisoning with Morphia and Luminal,
5.	Character of scaused and Witnesses;-
The accused Kemmerich gives the appearen.ee of being .sly and an uneducated quack,
he seemed daring his interrogation to bo confident mi his capability in l^ing
his way out; daring the said interrogation he contradicted himself so frequently
that it was necessary to record this interrogation in question and answer form.
The most significant pointer to his character was his act of fainting when first
confronted with the charge, obviously inorder to win time. The camp doctor was
called iaaediately end could not find anythiHjffmfch him.
Witnesses Estera Glaser (See deposition 1; is a most reliable and sensible
witness iA proyf&sional nurse with long experience she was subordinated to
Kemmerlch for a long enough time to know him personally and to be well capable of
judging his medical knowledge. She did not give the impression of being unduly
prejudiced against Kewmerieh and has no personal grifcvlancc against him,
Ui’sula Hberstein and Leonhard Stark although having been sentenced for their
dealings in Sas©! Goncentration, arc still afraid that they may suffer personally
because of their connections with the crime, Especially Stark(who is extremely
careful in his statements, but on the other hand admits to the interrogator that
he knew all aboht the murder of 'Tzymalkowska but does not dare give a statement
to this, effect, as la© was Camp Qomman&ant of Basel -and is afraid of further
rvpercu&on on his sentence. Eberstein should make a very sensible witness.

was the Aufseherin Ursula E&wSTBIN. She was re span ible to the me-
dical officer KSsMSSICH, who acted as a doctor,
3.	Approximately at the end of 1944 a Jewish Polish rlsaner, Helene
I’ZYLL&KOWSKA was sent from the working site to the hospital. She had
been beaten on the working site and therefore was bleeding from the mouth
and bad a head ache, I .’SMALKOffSKA ms very healthy and had a strong

was generally known ';hat she had a good voiee* ^
4.	B rine; the following night she started to r ge in the hospital and when•

was mad.

siness, she is going to "croak" any-'how, because one cannot, have some-
thing like this in the camp*. Thereu.,,on he gave EBsh-SKIK the following
instructions which I happened to hear myself: "A daily in ection of two cubic—
centimetres of morphine for fZIMALKClV 5KA as well as three tablets of Ip-
minal". F-rt ermore he added: "If her heart should be too strong the

with much clerical work for 1MKK, Alrea^r at the tin« when
•I called on him I had the definite impression that he int rated
to avoid these troubles. He did not say this verbally but 1
assumed this from his • remark with ”the bu.ilet into ;he head1'# fhis
was easy for him as he h-.d the authority to do with sick prisoners
what lie want & to do with them. X know this as I saw the- death cer-
tificates made out by him and I noticed that lie filled them in at
will. Therefore it .as easy for him to bump the -atierf; off in order
to avoid the traas ort to KEIMK-Aa,ll,
• 7, The day after I had reported to &>;•.« BKSCH, he himself ins.- eoted the
sick-bay at 3i3EL accompanied by the French profe sor. Both examined
the patient* KiMMEBICH said that she was mal ingering thereupon she
started to insult Hitler and the Nazis, The profe .sor ascertained
that she wa.- suffering from the nerves. Thereupon KilSiifiRIDH prescribed
the Mcure% although he did not say it expressly as it is dangerous
to speak openly in a concentration camp it ,as apparent that he -in-
tended to kill ffiXliLKOwTaEA with a too strong dosis, I heard that he
mentioned morphine and luminal but I cannot remember she dosis, I
assumed from the doctor’s and professor’s horrified faces that he
purposely prescribed a too strong and lethal cure. It was quite apparent
from the expression of the faces of these two that KiiiuERICH intended to hill
the patient. Moreover KMMBH2CH ordered that the patient -should receive
only half the rations which was very little in, a concentration camp,
A person could not have lived on half a ration, eaoept perhaps when one
stayed in bed, Ki , ,. HIGH said to me; "Why fatten the ;„ad umcoesuarjEly,
she is much t o strong and would only cry still more; moreover it
would prolong the "cure*1. It was obvious that h® went "prolong her
'life". But I did not obey his orders and gave her. food myself,
8.	The next day the doctor told me that luminal is a sedative but that
a too strong dosis, like that which K MJBEIGH had prescribed for
the -patient, would always have a lethal effect, KeiaJSHSCH knew
exactly the effect of luminal and morphine and knew that the dosis
he had prescribed, for the patient would have a lethal effect. He
was very experienced in medical respect,
9,	Also the , atitnt had the impression that HBf.iih'BICH intended to kill
her, as sire ms always very afraid bf him and would not take the
prescribed cure. Therefore the doctor had -ordered that BZIMALKOV-'SKA
was to be tied to the bed so that !Q1 r.KXCH’s orders could be carried
out. At■first this was done with a string and later when the string
ms torn with insulated wire, I myself have seen that she was tied
and after three days'! ordered the. doctor to remove it,
10,	I do not know any details about the cure jpescribed by ILiMlHIGH.
The tipoter administered it and the first tiwa 'SHNHJHIGH himself
administered the injection, only Once Xg^awe the patient'pills,
the doctor told ma that they contained vitaraines and I mysiif tuck
one. I know that the doctor gave her also .luminal' tablets, as pres-
cribed by ks-i iviEfilCH, but I was never present.
11,	When after about a week	came again to the sick-bay he
looked at the patient once again. Apparently he was not .satisfied
with the progress of the deterioration, I do not know whether
he increased the "remedy", but when I saw him the day after in
the train camp he said: “Well, how is your insane, is she dead (	.... .
already?" When I answered in the negative, he continued: "Doe's
she receive: her injections?" I told him that the female doctor
had told me that the patient did not .ant to sub ect herself
to injections whereupon he answered: "Tell the doctor that under﻿S&&L2
all circumstances she must give the injections 'otherwise I will
come and wi.il give her scsae injections norseif, but those -will be
proper injections’1.
X do not know why KB iHBlOH asked all this as on the proceeding
ctay he himself had been in t'ae sick-bay, however, it might have been
-possible that he really ordered a considerable increase of the dose,
and that is why he inquired the next day.
12. Three weeks after the prescribed cure had oomraenoed (prescribed by
-pilldSEiGI!), mSSiSSMSSMA died. Game of death was failure of the heart,
and during the last few days she was already unconscious,
15. I am convinced that KEidilHXGH’s cure -had killed her, When she-was
brought to the sick-bay she was in a very fit state. After ESihSKlGH’s
cure commenced she 1 literally declined from cay to day and. was con-
tin- ally starving. The difference in her physical condition within a
period of thee weeks was appalling.
14, X do not know about any similar cases where KE.S-.2EICH is concerned.
X think that he left HAMBD® in February 1945*

gation Unit at No. 4 0.1.0. between lo.oo hrs. and 14.oo hrs.
on the 14th of December 1946.
Kurt Otto Kemmerich is informed that he is not bound to
answer any questions but anything he says will be taken
down in writing and may be used in evidence.
1. I am Kurt Otto Kemmerich, born TLrst Apr. 1918, of
German nationality, by profession post-office official
(crossed out in ink and
initialled: "K.K.")
I make the following declarations voluntarily without
compulsion or persuasion and of my own free will.
Q,, :	what was your appointment and rank in November 1945?
A.:	I was medical NCO (Unteroffizier) and had been posted
to the "Stutzpunkt” (Subsidiary Camp) Spaldingstrasse, Ham-
burg area, of Neuengamme Camp. I was in charge of &&& all the
&&&&& medical care of the "Stutzpuntct" and it's branches.
We had been appointed to deputise for the "Standortarzt"
(garrison M.O.) NEUENGAMME, Hauntsturmftlhrer TSCHIBINSKY.
I myself had to supervise 2o doctors, chosen from among
the prisoners. The "Revier" (sick-quarters) of Sasel KZ
was one of the branches belonging to my district. The
prisoner-doctor there was a Czech Jewess, I do not remember
her name.	^	^
9,.:	Were you adressed as Scharfuhrer?
A.:	Only after *Christmas 1944 we were
We had not been told if that meant that belonged to the
33 then. We also wore the Meath's- head* ensign, but under
the national emblem of the Army under the cap. At the left
side of the collar- we wore the swastika-SS-sign (Ru^nen
hakenkreuz).
Q. :	How could you carry out this medical Job?
A.:	I had received medical training with the voluntary
fire brigade as well as with the Army. Moreover I taught
myself by books and from questions I put to the prisoner-
doctors. I also had been sent to Neuengamme to become
acquaint d with the medical work in the camp. I stayed
tier© fo" 4 weeks. This was about August/Sept ember 1944.
Q.:	What was the opinion of the above mentioned
prisoner-doctors of your medical exceriencs?
A.:	They were satisfied.
Q,.:	Did you independently give orders with regard to
medical treatments?
A.:	In smaller cases I gave -ardors personally.
I was furthermore in charge of the medical supplies and
the hygiene in the camp.
Q. :	Do you rsmemb r Helene TZ^YlMLICOWSKA, a Polish
'Jewish prisoner at Sasel Camp?’
A.:	I canot remember the name
To page 3.
adressed as such.
I﻿2
Q.:	Do you remember a prisoner who allegedly became mad ?
A.:	Yes
Q,.:	?/hen I saw you yesterday and asked you for the ^irut
time, why this prisoner was murdered, did you fall sick
and start rolling your eyes immediately after this question ?
A.:	It is right, that I felt sick and perspirated. I had
just returned from my work. This happened not immediately after
your question, but later on during further interrogation.
It was caused through thebad air in the room.
Q.:	Do you intend to stick ^o that answer in this vour state-
ment on oath, although I inform you again that you did not
fail sick later during further interrogation, but immediately
after I had put above question to you ?
A.:	Yes.
Q,. :	Then my own statement on hand of my notes from yesterday
and personal memory that you fell sick immediately after that,'
question concerning the murder of the TZYMALKOWSKA are not
the truth ?
A.:	I carrot say this, I felt already	before that moment
therefore I cannot remember when exactly it started.
Q.:	Is it right that I called immediately for the Camp doctor
who thoroughly examined you?
A.:	Yes. You called immediately ^or the doctor but it lasted
ten to fifteen minutes before he arrived.
Q,. : . What did he ascertain?
A.:	That I was covered with sweat. I cannot say what else
he said as he wrote a certificate which he signed and I saw ^
that you enclosed ;his into your file (enclosed as exhibit "jfjLP")
Q,. :	Do you want to say something?	XV'
A.:	Yes. I want to say, that I expecred a better treatment
for me instead of being interned in an internment camp, as I
always treated the prisoners humanly, in ^act as the proverb
says (a german proverb) :	blew their behinds un with sugar
of grapes"!	y
Q,. :	What happened to Tzymalkowska?
A.:	I was phoned up 'rom SASEL camp I do not know by whom
and was told that a Jewess has gone mad. I said , they should
give her one tablet of luminal daily to calm her. I wanted
that she rested to become normal again.
■Q. :	Did you visit the patient yoursel-f?
A.:	I was phoned up by the Aufsehrin Eberstein who told me
that the patient was shouting loudly and upsetting the whole
camp. Therefore I went to the 3ASEL sickquarters two days
afltrer the first telephone call.
Q. :	In what condition did you find the patient and "/ho else
was present?


A.:	The patient was alone in the room. Her hands had been
tied. I cannot remember whether her feet had been tied too.
Elastic bandames had been used for that purpose. She behaved
very impatient. The female prisoner - doctor, EBERSTEIN,
and two Jewish nurses were present. I do not remember exactly
whether STARK was also present. It is'possible that the »oup^o»
Andree van STEEMBERGEN came with t® . He was an experienced	’
medical orderlev.	His address is Brussels, Rue Lonis, Masae 18.
Q.:	In which way did the patient behave "impatient"?
A.:	She shouted: " Doctor you will help me the others will
onle*poisen me". She glared at me and cried. She only would
be couched by the Jewish nurse or me. I sat at the side of the

l>ed, she seized my hand and said: "Doctor you are. good”.
q, • How was she able to do this with her hands tied ?
A. t This was possible hecaase her hands were tied to the
side of the bed-.
q, W!iat orders did yoti giro*?
A. : I ordered to loosen her hands and to put her into
a straight“picket, bo that she could not Injure herself.
This order was not executed before I left.

Q, ■„ WIty should she injure herself ?
A. * I assumed this becauee she was so impatient and
had already broken up furniture of one room. I had seen
also a mad prisoner at Heuenganatte who had injured himself.
Q, ; flhat was your diagnosis?
A, :	1 ascertained that the was mentally insane. Her
nhfsieal condition was satisfying In fact she wbb leas
emaciated IliMthe prisoners of Basel generally were. She
wee "well covered with fat all over". The female doctor
told me, that she had a strong heart.

Sid the patient insult the Nasis?.
Sot in my presence
0. • Did you proscribe anything'?
i, • Yes,'I told the f«naie doctor to give her one tablet
of luminal daily and asked for a special nurse, to guard
her. Furthermore 1 told the female•doctor that I wopld
telephone the Standortarst mstllTTflAMMS,
% :	Why ?
A. " Because the female doctor ha$ no experience in these
matters. Furthermore I did not want to carry such a respon
sibility myself as in consequence of the tied hand®- a
biood-st.sgn8tion would be caused wiiich could affect the
heart of the patient and kill her.
q. * How was if then possible, that the patient with her
hands tied in such a-manner could seise your handsv
4 ; she vma not bound as tight as all- that, there was
space left.
Q» • Then why should there occur a blood-stagnation?
A. :	She was not bound too tightly, but in unguarded
moments the patient -might have stemmed herself against
the binding,.
Q* • Then what actual sense was there in this phone-call
as you yourself had ordered already & istralgiat-jacket
instead of the binding, or is it not perhaps nearer to
the truth that you-aid not phone up the Stanaart&rzt
at all.?

mm﻿A. ; I phonod to him immediately after I left SASBIr-carap and
he ordered to put the patient into a straight-jteket. Heathen
listened to my report and. ordered to give the patient three

the strength of our Morphine and 1 gave him the numbers „
Q. :	What were these numbers?

that kind, or is aot the weakest solution in use 0. 03 per cublo-

You can make .inquiries at. the '*i&BPHAJTO^WfTOKSrt in liAhBTJRG
BAkMB-SOK, \Bl^r© I got my ampules,
V-f-
Q*:	Was it your opinion, that the Standortarzt prescribed
to large a quantity?
A. s	As X never had worked with	morphine	I did	not	know that.
Q. :	What did you do then?
A. i	X passed the order by phone immediately on to	the female
Doctor.
Q. i	What did the female doctor	say?
A. j	She mentioned, that it was	a rather	large	-yiantity, but
I answered that those were the prescription© of the Standort-
arat and that he must be right,
Q.:	What happened further?
A.; On the second or third day after my first visit BBBRGfBIl?
called on. me an d told me, that the patient was calmer and
sleeping. 1 said, bo that we yet are going to win and the patient
will be all right again . I was very ranch relieved, that the
patient felt better.
0*:	Did you now order any restrictions with regard to the
ordered prescriptions especially in respect to'the Morphine?
A.:	No, I thought I could rely in that respect on the female
Doctor.
Q»j Did you pay another visit to the patient?
A,:	Approximately the 5th, or the 6tlr! or the 7th day after
m y first visit I saw the patient again.
Q.:	What did you .see and who else was present?
A.:	She was not tied any more. She iffa.de a cjuiet und sleepy
impression, physically she was hardly changed, I want to say
hardly emaciated. The female Doctor and two Jewish nurses were
also present, probably I came again wit." the Kapo VAN STSIS8SP.0SN,
Q« t	What did you Say to the -$em :.ilc Doctor? .	?£. d-
A*:	’Thanks God, wo are going to win, I think we msk can
stop with the Morphine.
Q*t That is to say that the female doctor did continue to
administer Morphine after the a/m visit of SBSRSTEIN to you
and her report that the patient was calmer ?
A. :	That I do not, know,
Q* : ‘Chen why did you say to th; female doctor on this visit
to the sic fejouarters, to stop with anorphina for the futwre?
A. s 1 was under the impreaaioa, that she h ad continued to
administer morphine.
# t
4.t Bo then in spite of all you were of the opinion that the
patie nt still reo eived morphine from the female doctor oven
after the report of EBSRSTffilN to you. several days before this
your visit to the sick-ituarters?
To Page 5﻿- 5 -
-A. :	Accordingly yeo, 'bee auss of the sl©GX)y looks of the
•piient. Moreover I had supplied the fm ale doctor ?rith a oonmleto
Tac kage o f ten ampules and I reraeiriber that the Eberstein
fetched a second ooraplet© package from me for the female doctor
and before w sooond visit to the siefc~quarter<3.
Q. ; Did you therefor a reproach the feraalo doctor that the
patient still received morphine although she was ca.lmor?
A. :	Ho&£.
v.-/-
Q*:	But what dad you then think did the atundortarzt mean
with hi a presex-iption in his alleged order, when he said to
administer luorphine only "later on" ?	.
A. ; I understood, he meant, if the state of the patient tv#1"**'
should detorriorate and she should not become calm’ by LaarfSal.

Q. • And now, although the patient had become calmer she still
received morph ine, and nevertheless you did not reproach the
female doctorV
A*:	res, because I only was the medical orderly and she was
the doctor with the greater experience. I never gave orders about
use of medicaments, except not to waste them.
Q. : Wiere you the superior to the .female doctor?
A.: Yes, I had the authority t® give orders, and could issue
instructions to the female doctor which she was hound to obey.
But she did xiot always obey ay orders.
Q. • v”hut h appened with doncentrstion-Oartp prisoners who did
not obey orders of their oomp-offioials?
A*j Neuengamme h ad to be informed about him. That meant that
he peroonelly had to report to Weuengcumne. I do not know what
happened there with him then, b&t -4ten I was at S80BNGAMMS,
prisoners were always treated well there. And 1 also never
reported the female doctor.
Q.:	An d though you were “only the medical orderly*, you n ow on
your second vioit to tne SaseX sick—quarters did issue the order
to the female doctor, to stop with the morphine?
A. ; I ©aid; **1 believe we can stop wit}) morphine now and start
do give her light food again,rt
™ Q.} Then why did you not send these instructions for the •
female doctor at aico, when KBJBR8TSIH reported several days
earlier to you that the patient was calmer?
,yA. : Bec^.so i could re3y on the Jewish nurao, who was very
efficientJvnBhe female doctor had told me. She hud great knowledge
and was an aboslutely trustworthy personality.
Q** You said beforej nstart to give her light food again", that
food had she the received up to that moment?
A. } During the first time the patient refused to take any
food at all, I do not know, if she later on ate the light food.
In ay presence she ate nothing. I prescriped grape-sugar.
9. s Did you. sec the. food of the Jewish nurse beside the
patient’s bed?	did see
Ho, X di ' not. I	a cup of coffee beside the
VJ-
Bid you hear the patient cry for somethinr to sat
because of hunger?
A. i 3h.o did hot cry in jry presence.
Q*t What were the further happenings?
A. :	Some days later - it is right that I thought yesterday
it was one tc two days later, to-day 1 think it was four to
five days later, an exact number I canot state at all - it was
A. :
bed.
<4. ’
To Page 6﻿iported go me that the patient had died-
f
*4. i What was your opinion when yon hoard thlc?
A. :	That the patient had died of poisoning with Luirlnal and
Morphine and. of physical weakness.
Q. :	How i a it possible that death caused by physical weakness
could occur so shortly after your second visit at SASSE. side-
quarters when at the time of that visit you found the patient
■’hardly cnaeiated”?
A. :	Because a human body does not loose flesh so qAickly, that
one can notice this decoy already such a short time before the
day of 'death of physical weakness"; and further, ‘because of
her not taking any food, her body could not stand the effects
of Luiidnal and- Morphine. Already during i;y first visit of the
patient the dBURSTBIH reported to me, that the patient refuses
to fake food.
q#* If this was reported to you, then why did you permit the
female doctor inspite of this circumstances that patient refused
from start to take food, to administer Luminal and Morphine?
A.:	I had reported this to the St-mdort.-j.rst, but he said,
as soon as eh© will be calmer, she will start to eat again,
n
Q. :	If it was known to you, that the human body canot stand
the effects of Lmninal and Morphine without talcing f<k>& at the
eume time, why did you not convince yourself personally, that
the patient took food at the same time?
A# :	I e—ould not do this, as rqt district - was too largo.
Q.; How could you have felt so sure, that the doctor and
nurses gave food to the patient, when you said during your
second visit to the female doctors "Now we can start to give
her light food again " - or did you not say this because
yon v/ere fully aware that the patient did not have had my
food up to that moment?
A. :	I wanted to say with this, that the patient had not taken
any food up to that moment of which I was aware as it h,.d been
reported to me.
Q, ; $b.en ?
A. ; This had already been reported to me on my first visit to
Ahe pa then t.
5*.:	Then you were aware of this already since then?
A. ; Yes, as it has been reported to me.
Q. :	So you. were aware of the fact, that the patient did net
take any food, and you were aware, that she took Luminal and
Morphine?
A. :	I know, that I passed on the instructions to the female
I
death of the prisoner it became clear to me, that this was a
case of poisoning effected by Luminal and Morphine without
taking food at the same time.
4.:	Or is it not better to say, that you intended to murder
the patient in. that way?
A. ; No, I did not Intend to murder 'her.
4. ; Then who did poison the patient, the female doctor?
a, ; J5o, she only Hininis tered the Luminal and Morphine,
Q. ; Then was it the Utun-'dortarstV
A,; Yes, by the instructions he gave me and which I passed on.
I myself believed the patient would recover.
TO PAGE 7-
﻿<4.:	Did the Steoidortarat intend to kill hep?
A.:	I canot answer this question, to me he did not say
•anything about this.
t. :	Whore is at present?
A.:	Kauptstwrhifu Tachibins kj- ( I do not know th© right
way of spelling his name) is said to have been arrcoted in
HAMBURG.
4.:	Is it known to you, that eveii'Tull-blooded*1 Gem~ns
7/ere killed by the H. si 1£ thejf- cons idered thorn to bo luad ?
A. :	I have he rd about that.
Q.:	Do you fjalisve that Polish con'eentr&tion-oanrp-rpx'isonars
were treated-better in that case?
A.:	Do yon mom to say if the prisoners conee nod were .lust
Polish or also Jewish?
(4.:	3t?t Is say in case of Jewish prisoners?
A.:	In that case I hardly believe 30.I am convinced, that if
tne putlent would have been sent away from SA8EL, that she
would have been killed then. As she was a very good worker,
’0i tried to keep her.	- ■
Q. ; How do y u explain, that you stated in the beginning
of this interrogation, that your reason, for phoning up the
Bt;jodcrtarat was, that you did not want bo carry on yourself
the responsibility of her eventual death. According to above
no such responsibility exois ted when a mod Jewish prisoner
was c oncer-nod?
a.:	I meant the responsibility I would have to carry in the
presence of God.
14, :	But if this responsibility did not eicsist towards your
superior, on the contrary those superior authorities intended
to kill mad prisoners, why did you call up in that case just
this superior?
A.;' I asked the superior, not to take the usual measures
in that ease, in order to save'the patient.
4.:	But the result was that the patient .died?
A, :	The patient died in spite of this.
4.:	And in your own opinion she died because of having
been poisoned?
A. :	In my opinion she must have been poisoned.
Q. :	I ,yn going bo read to you n w the ’statement ma e by
a witness? ( Deposition Glaser No. ►.!.•. is read out to 05M.MSRICH)
A.:	All thin is not true-.
•
4.: I have to point out t: you that the witness who made this
statement is the same nurse, you yourself called a most trust-
worthy per-s on?
A. ; Then this Jewess is lying.
Q. :	And for what reasons?
A. :	She wants to put the blame on me in the same way, as the
whole of the Oerrur. People is blamed now for the shameful
AAAAfeb crimes of the conccntration-o ..rape. Of those crimes I
know only 3a aw, after having read abo :.;- It in the ne.vsp .-.pers.
It further must be ..n yet of revenge on her part.
Q. :	An upV P'f revenge for what?
A. j This nurse has no personal 'r/.'aoou for that. The nurse
I mean h as a 'squint.
To Page 8-﻿8
Q. :	I am g oing to read out ±o you some other depoebtone of
v/itnes^es V ( Dop. Nos.. A/Jt/X
A. : . It is all lleg. BaUpecially it is untrue, that the patient
was afraid of me, or |hat I myeelf administered an infection
of morphine. • ^ y
Q. :	So that is to say, that all the witnesses are lying
only you are talking the truth?
A. :	They are trying to put the hi.-.me on me, in order to get
acquitted themselves. And furthermore, 1 dc not helleve ut all, •
that the witnesses actually did make all the statemonts you
read out to me.
Q. :	Would yon Relieve it, if I show you their signatures?
A.:	When the witnesses aotually make these statements
then they -.re lying. I 'wish to give ...Ibo names of my own
wi tnesses.
Q. :	Who are they?
A. :	. Van BxiSNNBjSEtrEj'T is one. Further Professor (JOUINAUD of

:	I urn ^ust informed hy 'the camp~office that thif original

Deposition on oath of Paul MfSTJJSS, male of 4 QIC,
sworn before J. G. 6B0T;'; , Civilian Investigating
Officer, No 1 Team, Field Investigation Section,
War Grimes Group (MB), at Ko 4 CIO IWttJNSH&BSBf,
on the 26th February 1947.
Paul KSLijsS is informed that he is not
bound to answer any questions, but that anything he
says will be taken down in writing and may be used
in evidence.
1 am Paul MaLLES, bora at DUESSELDOB! on
the 3 Feb. 1899, I am ooafeotioner by occupation,
I was married, of Go man nationality,
1 attended the school until I was 17 years
of age and then, from 1st April 1913 until October 1916
1 was apprentice confectioner in COLOGNE. From the 1st
October 1916 until J ne 1917 I was as an assistant in
COLOGNE, then I became a soldier and remained there
until 30 September 1919. I was released when I held the
rank of Gefreiter. Dn.il 1939 I was confectioner in
HMDSBORG, DUESSELDOfiF, COLOGNE, KAS' EL, 300HDM, On the
26th August 1939 I was called up into the Wehraacht,
in January 1940 I was promoted to Unteroffiaier and in
December 1941 to Feldwebel. From October 1941 until
January 1944 I was in the East (Russia). After I had
been wo. 'nded for the second time I came to the hospital,
then to the Reserve-battalion, and then to the Waoh-
oompany Truppenuebungsplatz WAHN (COLOGNE). In July
1944 I was posted via MUERSTSS to ATJSSGHSITZ to the
Waffen SS, After three days we, 100 guards and 1000
Jewish women had to march off to HAMBURG. This journey
lasted for 1-g- days. I was off duty. In HAMBURG 1 was
in charge of the administration of the canteen and food.
In September 1944 these women were detailed to the 3
Ausse narbeltslager, HEUGRABEN, SASEL,, EIDEISTEDT.
Afteirwards we got male prisoners from HSUSNGAMME,
of Russian, Polish, Yugoslav, French, Gelbian, Dutch
and Danish nationality. There were about 1200-1300
of them. These people were detailed for the "Programm
GSIL. /NBERG”, i.e, clearing away of bomb-debris and
repairs. My job consisted in the administration of the
delivered meals and the canteen. In October 1944 I
became SS Oberscharfuehrer. During the first time our
camp was on the Dessauerhafen (Free-port). After this
had been destroyed during an air attack we were
transferred to FUHLSBUiSPTEL, and from there to SPAL-
DlilGSTRASSE. I also had to visit occasionally the above
mentioned women camps to look after the cantten stuff.﻿/7

d
It happened th t I, owing to lack of discipline
(thefts) hit several men with my hand. It happened very
seldom, probably 3~4- times. I help d the people whereever
I eould and therefore th© prisoners eonfided in me,
I never ill-treated or beat women. I never beat someone
so that he bledfeed- or th t he fell to the ground. The
former Rapport fuehrer FIGK'JRS once beat a prisoner in
a distance of 20-30 meters from ms with an object (stick
or leather tube). Thereupon 1 went there and forbade
this beating arid reported SiGEBtS to the Obersturmfubrer
rilREKMil : . Later I witnessed row Hauptsturmfuehrer
WSm «at the Lagerarat Andre vor. STESNftJtGM from
BRDSSiSLS. Von SfttHBESKS often got cigarettes from me,
and 1 often contacted him, also the v-raan of the Danes.
Owing to my job in the office and duties like getting
coals, straw and. other articles 1 myself was very seldom
in th . camp. Apart from that we were forbidden to enter
the prisoners’ camp.
Until 15th March 1945 I was in SPALD1KGSIRAS8E
and then I was for 10 days in MEUEr^G-AMME, where 1 was
without work. In the month of April I had to visit the
camps PORTA (Westfalen), FALLESSLEBER, SAtOTEDSL and
SAL2GITTER as a courier. At about the end of April I
returned to HAMBURG SPALDIHGSTMSSB and on the 3rd May
I raarohed together with the column BLUEMEL (Hauptstuna-
fuehrer) to Schleswig-Holstein and on the 8th May 1945
I was taken PoW by the British. On the 25 July 1945
I was released to ILiCTIILEK. On the 18th October 1945
I was arrested in ROLANDSRCK and was imprisoned in BOM
until the 7th December 1945* On the 7th December 1945
1 was transferred to KEOFLMGHAUSM.
That is all I have to say.

on 10 Steb. 1947.
I a® Alio© K0BCK08SKA, bom on 22 April 1925, at LODZ
(Poland), Sfly nationality is Polish,
I have seen MffiDES once at SPAJD1I«STIUSSS Mo 152, as
I went to the dentist 1 saw METiL’-S beating one of the
prisoners (a man whom I assimd to be a Czech, 18 years old),
ifc hit this man in the fae© ami other parts of the body
with his fist with great strength. The man fell to the
ground unconcious awl he was bleeding badly. As he wad
lying bleeding on the floor, HECASS .hicteed him repeatedly
all over his tody, the roan was then bleeding from his mouth,
nose, ears and eyes. 1 saw all this while 1 had to wait
for about 10 (ten) minutes to go into the dentist, when
I last saw the man, he w s still lying unconeious or? the
floor so mrered with blood, MShMS had gone away and left
him lying there*
The other prisoners, all of whom were in a very ad
condition, told me that the SS man who had don© the
beating was call© MEELISS* That is all I saw at SPALDU©-
ST1ASS1, and 1 do not know what happened to tfa© beaten up
prisoner afterwards. 1 know nothing further about MELLES.
1 know Otto HETMAM, h® was one of -the SS guards at the
concentration camp in which I ws.s at the time. I often
saw him ill-treating old women for not being able to
work. Be hit m3, kicked them often very hard.
I rsKaeaber on® particular case when he sev-..r,.ly beat up a
woman for being in the possession of a few potatoes.
She was so badly hurt that she had to spent several days
in the HI room. & s®e®@ to partlculary go for elderly women
who wars unable to work, and left the younger ones alone.
.Apart from that I ©an state nothing further about SSXTMAWf
but think that SALA XLEESPLATZ at present at M01ICH, HACSEK-
BUCHEE ST8ASSE lo 11, may be able t© give further information
about HSXTMASI*s conduct, bemuse she used to w*rk in his
QomKindf.
This is all I |mw ajjd I have no further statements to make.

PTSHLSBOETfS* Prison situated in one of the Morth HaMBHES suburbs
was used from the middle 1935 as a Follselgefaengnla (Police Pri-
son) and was used exclusively by the Gestapo.
The main task of the prison was to "soften up" the prisoners and
prepare them for Gestapo interrogation. No one of the prisoners
kept in FUHLBHBTTEL had appeared in front of a court or was sen-
tenced by a Court of Law. According to the Gestapo instructions
the prisoners were either kept in PUHLSBQ3ITSL for further inter-
rogation or sent to different Concentration or Labour Education
Camps (AKL) for f#14*labour or liquidation.
The general conditions in FTJHLSBEJSraL Prison and different crimes
cotnisitted by the members of the prison staff have been dealt with
in the reports of FGHLSBOETTlIi Oases I and II.
In connection with the investigation in the FlMiSBUlS'TSL Case the
following members of the Gestapo in K&MRURG have been arrested
and located in different CIOs by the investigating officers :-
Henry HUMS,	Walter Paul MEM,
Ernst LISTZO*! ,	Alfons PMN9E,
Karl HHrarar,	Herbert UJEB33RS,
Adolf Nicolaus BCKST-MW, Hans NIERM&OT,
Karl Emm,	Margot GLASS,
Gerda GSOSHSRG.
The a/tn are partially Gestapo officials and partially only Gestapo
informers (so-called ¥-personnel)»
After Mie evidence against the a/m has been considered and the ad-
vise of the Legal Section obtained, it was decided that only Henry
HELMS, Ernst LXETZW and Adolf wmMkM can be tried by a British
Military Court as it is proved that they took part in crimes com-
mitted against Allied nationals who were imprisoned in FUHLSBOETTEL
Prison.
A lot of evidence against the rest of the a/m accused has come to
light daring the investigation of the PBIKSBOETTSL case. But as
these accused committed different crimes against German nationals
and there is not sufficient evidence available that they are also
implicated in crimes against Allied nationals, it was decided to
submit a separate report In their case, and to suggest to hand
over the case to the competent German authorities.﻿V
~ 2 -
It was also established that the German authorities are already
conducting investigations against the members of the HAMBURG Ge-
stapo and collected aiaple evidence against them.
SHOOTING g RUSSIA!? TOI?jGEff!l3 AND g IdALB KMa.
A> In the end of February or in the beginning of March 1%^. TS3SMAM
in his capacity of the Cownandant of PttHLSFJSTTJSl Prison took a
transport of 11 Russian prisoners ironi PlHffiSBHOTEKL Priijh to
HIM^T53)T» TE33iS/lM in his atatement (Deposltion-No. I ) admits
that he Isnew that the 11 prison era are going to be shot. He does
not remember who gave the order for the shooting of prisoners.
The prisoners have been brought to EIPSMTGIff and there shot in
the quarry, in the presence of about 200 people. HU® in his
statement (Deposit ion-^fo,I *i1 i) admits that he took part in this
execution but that he was not firing himsolf and only was posted
as a sentry.
In case if it will be decided to prosecute HKbMS for his part in
this shooting the same witnesses as in the ease No 2 of FUHLSBUBTTEL
I report (MSSSOTE-BEES) should be called.
B* In autumn 1943 five Russian female PoWs employed as slave labourers
in the N0L5JK0 Factory in HAMBURG were shot -«ithout atrial. The rea-
son for shooting was their refusal to work in view of the bad food
they reoaved. HELMS in his statement (T)eposrltion-No.l|,'5) again admits
that he was present at this execution and performed sentry duties.
It is worth pointing out that HEMS was a Gestapo Krirninal Sekretaer
and was the 2 i/o of on© of the most important Gestapo branches (Gom-
launism and Marxism) and therefor© his explanation that he was con-
stantly used merely as a guard during the executions seams rather
Incredible.
In case if it vdll be decided to prosecute HEMS for his part in
the shooting of 5 Russian female PcSts the saae witnesses as in Gas®
W 3 FUMBUlfTSL I Report (BAiSSWm-HSHR) should be called.
The case of the 5 $ Russian female PoWs was investigated by 12k Ge-
stapo, the girls were arrested by the Gestapo and all the arrange-
ments for their execution were made by the Gestapo.
C. In his statement (Deposition-No.• Vi) HEMS also stated that he took
part in the shooting of 6 Russian prisoners in EIDSLSTEBT in autumn
1943. WETJB admits this time-that he was a meniber of the firing
squad and fired a rifle on order of an S3 officer. No further evi-

A Czech club called "Svoraoot*' existed in HAMBURG during the war
years. HMB ordered one of his most important informers (V-aan),
Alfona FANNIE, to ^oin this club as a maaber. PANN5K who was pre-
viously known as a member of the communist party in Teheehoalovakia
was accepted in the club. As result of the reports made by PAHKEK
to HEWS the blub was dissolved and RAOlfflH who played an important
part in the club was arrested and sent to FUHLSBU5.TTEL Prison (Depo-
sitions of PAOTM, Maria lAttiffi® and Ursula FRUS33KAKN, No 6,^.3	.	).
Mrs. RACMAHN saw her husband for the last tba© on the 10th April 1945
when he was permitted to visit her in her home escorted byTCrimpo of-
ficial.﻿Two or three months before the end of the war the differ fait
branches of the HAMBURG Gestapo received an order to prepare
lists of FOHLSMJHPTSL Prisoners by dividing them in three
categories. On® list contained the names of the prisoners
who were recommended for release in case of the evacuation
of the prison. Second list contained the names of prisoners
to ik be transferred to another place (ASL K113>"HAS3BB)• Third
list contained the names of the most dangerous prisoners, the
intention being to transfer then to OTTBHGAMME for extermination.
All the evidence regarding preparation of these lists is contained
in fUHLSBDEOTHL 1 Heport (BASSEHTTZ-BEffi) Gase N 1 (Murder of 58
men and 13 women on the 22nd and 23rd April 1945)»
HSLiSS in his statement (Deposition-flo. • ^/) adndts that he most
probably put the name of MGM&©f on Uie list of dangerous pris-
oners that he prepared on request of Koraaiasar BCSDSEMASl, who
was his superior officer. He also admits in Ms Deposition (Wo 11 )
that lie put altogether about 20 names on the list of the dange-
rous prisoners. He admits further that tie men whose names were
put on this list, were later executed, but he explain® that at
the time when he was preparing the list he did not know its purpose.
According to the statement made by Mrs. MCMAIffl her husband Karel
RAGMAM was executed in UEUMCAMME on the 23 of April 1%5» She
received this information from the Oomndtee of the Former political
Prisoners in HAMBBBG. Hans SOTSfARZ, a member of this Cosaaite®, who
was ap inmate of NSUMGAMtfS Concentration Camp stated (Deposition-
No. o ) that he saw RACMAHN among the 71 men said women executed
on the 22/23 April in NSGENGAatK and even spolss to him.
In case if it will be decided to prosecute HELMS and BCKILMAI®
for their part in the case of death of .Karel HAGMAM the same
witnesses should be called as in Case N 1 FUHESJBtJJiTfiiSb I Report
(BASSmTZ-BEHR).
As it can be seen from the Depositions of witnesses FHUlSSMAffll,
A il ^	. i |M( 11.	), the Gestapo official Brnst
LKTZO’? was HMSS* assistant and helped him in Hie arrest of
RAOOBN, liquidation of "Svomost'*-club and alas took part in the
severe ill-treatment of prisoners interrogated by HHLM3.
S'msm TLSj-TBSATMMT OF DIFFERED AhhlSD NATIONiyhS.
Whan interrogating his prisoners EEMB and LIHTZ® usually ill-
treated them severely to obtain their oonfo.isions. The methods
used were as follows:-
Severe beating.
Tortures which can be compared to medieval ones.
Witnesses SCHULTZ (Deposition-#o.*1 ) and KRISTi’EIiVTc (Deposition-
No. & ) who were interrogated by HElis are desnribing the methods
of tortures used by him in the following manner.
KR13THLL]®:- "A sack was laid on the floor and my feet were tied
with handcuffs. % hands were always tied. HELMS pulled up my trous-
ers legs and tied ny hands behind ny back. Pieces of wood 3 cm thick
and 5 cm wide were placed on both my legs from baler.? the ankles to
above the knees. They were pressed together with carpenter vices,
three on each leg, one on the knees, one on the calf and one on the
ankles. On HELMS orders KISTSNjMJSSGE and HETGS screwed these tight
till the calves burst open. At the same time four edged pieces of
wood were placed between the fingers behind ay back. fingers were
then pressed together so that the fingers bled."
SCHULTZ:- makes a similar statement, accusing LIETZOW of torturing
him.﻿Considering, the statements mad® by ’sritnesses PANXSK (Depo-
aition-JJo* V ), PRlTB-33itm (Deposition-Web,M ) , and EfiHOSGHKB
(Depoaition-No, 10 ) there oan be no doubt whatsoever that
HRTJKPl interrogated in the above described mainer not only Ger-
man nationals as KHIOTSILER and SCHULTZ, but numerous Allied
nationals.
SCHULTZ gives even the names of tnro Prenohmen, Andre BAPTISTS
and Jup LW3 and a Fussian, Ivan 3T023KUAC 'aha were ill-treated
by METAIS, partially in his presence.
BAKISPE, LIFTS and ST03SUAC were not located during the inve *
atigationS.
The two Frenchmen Iiave been seen last during tits evacuation
march from FUHLSSiTETTMj to KXMi-HASSffi, they were in a very
bad state, showing the mar>3 of ill-treatment that they got
frota HELMS (Beposition-®sK of SCHDIjTZ) and it is probable that
they perished on he march or in KTSL-HASSHE*
A Dutch subject fTUDSHOP Franciskus (Deposi tion-JIo. ^ } stated
that he was s©ve:fflLy ill-treated by	wlien held as a poli-
tical prisoner in PUHLSSJETTEL Prison.
Witness S0HJI.TZ (Deposition-Ko. I ) states that the accused
BQKSyCffi®, HSTMS superior officer, was usually present when
the interrogations combined with tortures were carried out.

He admits also ill-treatment of various toattods
and using "special Gestapo approved methods for

also admits that he together with BG&SEMAM pre-
pared the lists of the dangerous prisoners, who
were later executed In KSHKH&AffilE. He explains,
however, that he did not knew the proper purpose
of these lists.
HEME is a typical brutal Nasi. H© is self-confi-

voluntarily. X have net been forced to do so and nothing has been
proraissed to me, if I do, I know that my statement will be written

I am Willi Bernhard Karl fESSMAM, born on the 15 Jan 1908 in HMBOBS.
I am of Evangelical fath and of German nationality, I am married and
have 6 children, I am a gardener, I was a member of the NSDAP dime

I was arrested on the 29 Jul 1945 and have been interned since,
I remember the shooting of 11 Russians in IEOMjSXKDT. I transported
them with several other guards to KEDELSI’HDf* I had nothing to do with
the execution, and I had also nothing to do with taking the condemned
men to the place cf execution, fhe names of tte other guards I cannot
remember A, but they came from FUHLSBUlfrTj'lj. Also this case X do not
know who condemned these 11 men, I know that they had been looting.
All prisoners who were kept at FUHCiSBHSTTSL had not been in front of
a court. Sane though were kept in "Sohutzhaf t", which means they had
already finished their punishment given to them by a court of law.

I am Ursula Anna mTJESSMiWf, bom on JO Dec 1925 in HAMBURG-, of the Lutheran
faith# I am unmarried and a shorthand-typist lay occupation. I was not & me #•
her of the Party or any other HS Organisation#
On 1 April 1944 I was taken on by tire Gestapo as a aiior than (3-typist. At first
1 worked for sane 14 days in the personnel office under SQBfARZBOEP# I than
went to I13LM3 and remained with Mra tin early in A ril 45» when 1 ms ill at
home, later applying for ray release about 24-25 April#
PMN.3& was also working on a case concerning a Czech group, the STORH03T.
He himself frequented it as I could see from his reports. In this connection
two of its members were arrested, a certain HAGMANN and one Yincanz, whose
surname escaped me, who was a locksmith from WZy-MjMSBOlG. RACMMCJ was inter-
rogated two or three times in my presence# On this occasion he received a box
on the ears. It could be notloed that HELMB could not delay on this case, but
would send him them to a EZ as they Gould not be brought to trial. I myself had |
to type out the arrest instructions in this case, which indicated category I
detention for the duration of the war. HELMS and L1STZ0W both indulged in bru-
talities. Among other Wilhelm KEIF was kicked in the bottom and punched in ay
presence, as was also Heinrich SCHROEDKR# Hilde SOHBuL was beaten by LUTZQW
in my presence. According to what HEIMS told me Annemarie Bdffll was whipped
by Mm, and this was described in the interrogation report as "third degree".
A half-Jew, Alfred GSM, who was arrested by HELMS and LISTZOw on a doit ting
he did not work and who resisted arrest, was first beaten in HELM's office
and then taken dowa to the cellar by HEIMS and LIETZOf* Both took whips with
them . On his return COfflf had completely swollen eyes and was veiy changed.
As he load struck HEMS on being arrested HEWS instigated his execution.
HMS and LISEZOW went to HSTEUGfiffllE for his execution, to which they also
invited me, but I refused.

With reference to ny previous statement, I can add the following
concerning the case of AUJESKT Ernst.
About the middle or end of January 1945* HEM3 was told \yj TlSSr!iJi
that an attempt to escape was being prepared fef an the Polisei
GefSnguis Plililsbiittel. Among those cmcemed were, as far as I
remember, WARD Kurt, BNGLER Otto, AUJESKX Ernst, and two Frenchiaen,
whose exact names I am unfortunately unable to give. As far as
I reiaember they were called Andre and Joseph. Some days later both
brenchmen were transferred to MSUEKGAME, by order of BILKS. There
HEI&S carried on a more severe interrogation in the presence of
LIETZOW.
Shortly before Ernst MJESH’s dismissal, he made written statements
at HEIMS HQ, concerning occurrences in the Polisei (Jefanguisj he
v/as forced to do this by E1LMS,
I should like to add that I can no longer remember precise details

132, on tbs 26th of February 1%7, before sne, Oapt Frederick Michael WiMSR,
Gen. List, of Field Investigation Section, War 0rimes Group (MS) B.A.O.R.
I am Hans 3GHWAR3, bom in VIEMA on 27/3/Qk, aaa -aitiiout religion, married
and am secretary by profession. I ■was never a faember of the WSDAP or any
of its branches.
On 2 February 1935 I arrested by the State Polio© in HaWA for ray acti-
vities for the Austrian Socialist Party, and was then at WIM-W012LLEHSDCHF,
Concentration CampsIMCHATI and HMJUi&AMMB until the liberation on 3 May 45*
In the evening hours of 23 April 194-5 two lorries drove up and altogether
58 men and 13 worn® got out. The men were taken under asoorit to Block 2S3
(punishment block), and all internees were prevented from entering this block.
Therefore every old camp-inmate knew that this must be a special affair. From
sy camp office, I was clerk together with Herbert SCSffilMi, I could observe
the preparations for the isolation.
As I was at the same time chairman of the illegal international internee com-
mi tee in	I triad to find out for rqyself for what reasons these
new-arrivals were being isolated. I discovered that among the 58 men, there
were 13 Czechs, Poles and Russians. I spoke to several of them, among others
a Czech carpenter from HAMBURG. They came from the interrogation prison in
HAMBURG and had been seat to HUTSIS-AMMI! by WHIMS and TESSMAHH. It appeared
from the conversation with Mm, that the Czech had been the leader of ika a
Czech association, to which HELMS sent a spy. On the following Sunday, 22
April, Obersoharfuehrar HASTE of the Political Department and another Ober-
scharfuehrer took the particulars of the 58 men from Hock 20 in the camp of-
fice.
On the evening of 22 April 194-5 I was making ray tour through the camp. As I
came out of the interne© bath-house, BKEXHW called me and wh« he discovered |
that I was the caasp clerk, THISASH, who was standing a little to one side in
the shadows, ordered the internees LEERS, CMELIUS, Uro SjETSETSM and Oasi
OOTKKDCKM to b© brought out. Some tira© later, when I was already in the oa/sp
office, I heard the tread of man marching past and the clatter of arms of the
guards. Later, \ihm I was already in Block 22, I heard shots and dull detona-
tions in the direction of the ©amp bunker. The shots and explosions could b©
heard clearly, as the night was clear* Hast morning BRBIMAffl told the other
BLookfuehrer in the Rapport fuehrer room that there was a fight in the bunker
and that TBfBSAHE had received a blow on the chin from one of the prisoners.
Shortly afterwards THCMJW arrived in camp with a plaster m his dbin. - Cta
the night 22 to 23 April 194-5 the remainder of the prisoners from Block 20 was
collected and liquidated in the bunker.

In Summer 194-2 I was ordered by EITOH to join th® Csoch union "Svomost*.
The chairman of this union was a certain Kar RAGMAM, a carpenter from HAM-
BUS. During a meeting of the union two Casohs in th© unifoxm of the Labour
service were present, MQMAOT publicly addressed the whole meeting and said
that Czechs who collaborated with the Germans would have to justify thsa-
aelvea on© day. I reposted this to ENUTH. Thereupon the union was dissolved
and RMMAM and his deputy SOfflOQOK were arrested. I do not know what hap-
pened to them.

HAMBUHBr, 36, Heue ASO Strasse 1, at	on 24- Nov 46*
before Capt. H.P. KINSLEIGH, The Cheshire Eegt. of War
Crimes Investigation tftiit BADE.
I am Karl Martin Max Ernst SCHULTZ, born on 3rd May I898 at HAMBUBS
and I am of evangelical faith. I am married and have 4 children. I
attended the Volkssohule until I was 15 years of age und then attended
a special school for engineers until I was 18 years of age. I am an
engineer foreman with the firm August HABEMAM at Wandsbeck. I have
never been a member of the NSDAP but I was compelled to join the SA
Reserve (1935-37). I was expelled from the SA for life-time because
I did not come for duty and insulted the Gauleiter T1LSCH0W. I was
sentenced to one year and 3 months imprisonment but was released after
one year in December 1938. Already at that lame I asked for a second
trial, Wich was prevented by the outbreak of the war
During my arrest I saw - in 1938 - the admittance of Jewish prisoners
of all ages and both sexes, including high pregnant women, who were
severely ill-treated by the SS. At that time I changed my opinion about
the national socialism and even intended to resist actively. After wy
release I met an aequahtance, Dr. SCHMIDT from LEIPZIG, with whom I dis-
cussed these things in the course of several conversations. He pr©missed
me every assistance if I would organize a resistance group in HAMBURG,
I did so, this group was named KDF (Kampf dem Fashismus, fight against
the fashism), it was based on a non-party foundation.
The resistance group was organized as foUwrs: The various districts of
HAMBURG formed groups, which were divided into cells. The factories were
amalgamated in to blocks. I was in contact with the group leaders and
partly with the Zellenleiters. The Block leader was subordinated to the
Zellenleiters of the Factories.
Partly the foreign workers were organised in these blocks. Heinrich
3CHR0EDEE of HAMBUEG-Eidelstedt was responsible for all the foreign
blocks 5 Later SCHROEDER was executed in KEUBRGAMMS. In 1944 SCHRQEDER
introduced me to a man named MUELLER. Later it was found out that this
was a pseudonym, his real name was Alfons PAMEK. We intended to appoint
PAHNEK a group leader and for the time being he was subordinated to
SCHROEBER to become acquainted with his job. In ny factory we secretly
produced dynamit. This dynamit was buried in 1IDELSTE3DT. It was intended
to resist actively when the Allied troops approached HAMBURG. We int^&ed
to blow up the tank barricades and to prevent the blowing up of bridges
with armed troops. The Hochbunker which was intended as HQ of the Gau-
ls itung, should be put out of action by our confidence man through active
sabotage, PANNEK, SCEROEDER and I made a plan of HAMBURG which contained
all these things and the places where we would assemble, etc. Each of us
3 men had a copy.
The following foreign workers held a higher position in our organisation:
among others*:
the Frenchmen: Andre BAPTISTE from PARIS District,
Jup LITO	” AREAS "
The Dutchman; Knut RAIMUND
the Russian: Ivan STOZKUAC
the Russian woman: Anni JAKUDIC.﻿/<f
2 -
The 2 Frenchmen and also the Russian were arrested together with
SCHRQE33EE in December 1944. I started to distrust PA33MK shortly
before and especially after the arrest of SCHRGEDEE for the following
reasons: Appx every fortnight a coureer cane from LEIPZIG to HAMBURG
with messages and instructions* We also had connections to BERLIN and
MAGDEBURG. PANNEK always wanted to meet this coureer and if the coureer
was due to come he came to my factory on his bicyble 2 or 3 times a day.
I saw the coureer for the last time in February. PANNSK came to the
factory, but he missed •ttie coureer just for a few minutes. I was arrested
on the 5 April 1945 by HELMS and LIETZOT on the Gaensemarkt in the even-
ing at 1800 hrs. As a security measure I had burnt all my records after
SGHRQEDER* s arrest. I kept the key for the coureer1s Code hidden in my
pocket mirror; PAOTEK knew this. I was interrogated in the Hochbunker at
the Keiligen Geist Feld. Fraeulein acted as a secretary. All my things
were taken off me. HELMS immediately took the mirror, opened it, but he
did not find the Code, as this was hidden in a special form in a the co-
ver of the mirror. After I had refused to make a statement 1IBTZ0W put
pencils between ny fingers and used them as a torture. As I still refused
to talk they stopped this and tried to get a confession by bluff. At first
he showed me a list with the names of ny comrades, later I had to admit
that some of them belonged to us as their names were in ny note-book too.
Then he showed me ny file, which allegedly contained SCHROEDER's statement
concerning ny person. Among others I saw a secret report concerning a con-
versation between SCHRGEESR and PAOTEK. I immediately suspected that PAN-
NEK was a spy. Later this was confirmed on the march from FUHLSBU1TTEL to
KIEL by Andre BAPTISTE and Jup LUTE,as well as fcy the Russian Ivan STCTZ-
KUAC. The two Frenchmen told me among others that they had been interro-
gated by HELMS and another unknown person. BAPTISTE entered the room first
and was interrogated about us, he denied to know us, thereupon he was bea-
ten up by the persons. Then LUTl^iwas called in and when he also denied
he was beaten up by the two men. I do not remember whether they were in-
troduced by HELMS to PANNEK who was known to them as MUELLER, on the same
day or later; when they again denied to know him, they were severely bea-
ten up. Many weeks later when I saw them again on the way to KIEL I could
see the marks of the beating distinctly. BAPTISTE*s both hands were badly
swollen and the fingers were bruised, over the left ear there was a scars
still bloody. He lamed badly and told us that besides the torture he also
received kicks and beatings. LUTE who told me the same had no visible
wounds,he only lamed. STCTZKUAK told me on the same march that he had heard
that JAKUDIG had been transported to NEUMGAMIB at the beginning of 1945*
After my maltreatment in the Hochbunker, I ms transferred to FUHLSBUSTTEL
and put into a dark cell C 1/19» I was admitted under the pseudonym Walter
SGHUELEE and was compelled to live under this name until the liberation.
I remained in the dark cell until the 12 April 1945 ^-ncl during this time
I received tyro or three warm meals, once bread and honey, each morning a
mug of ooffee, and the whole time no washing water. In the morning of the
12th I had to line up on the corridor with about 200 other men. Our names
were called up, I under the name of SCHUELEK, evezy man received about
half or three quarters of a loaf of bread, some cheese and margarine.
We were told that this was our ration for 3 or 4 days. Except one man our
guards vrere foreign S3 men. Hans HEMEHGS was in command, Hans HAHN had to
arrange the accommodation and he had a bicycle. When we were at a distance
of about 4 km from FUHLSBUETTEL, a Jewish fellow-prisoner could not go on
and remained lying on the ground. ilMNIMGS and another man remained behind
too. We were about 150 m away, when I heard 2 shots from this direction.
Later, when we were resting on a meadow, 2 prisoners - one of them was a
Russian - had a quarr&L. When we marched off, - as far as I can remember -
Hans HAHN and another man remained behind with the Russian. I heard a shot.
I have never seen the Russian again, f/e had to spend several nights on the
march, the last night we spent near BQRDESHOLM on a farm belonging to the
farmer SCHU300M in MUEHBROOK on the barn. In the morning when we were
marching off, 4 men were missing. HENNINGS ordered to search the barn with
pitch-forks and poles. As far as I know 2 prisoners escaped. Two other
prisoners were found, I do not know their nationality. One of them was ter-
ribly beaten up in our presence, we only heard the screaming of the other
one when he was beaten up on the bam. HENNING* incited his guards by shout-﻿- 3 -

ing to kill these two prisoners. Both of them were shot, to-day 1 oannot
remember by whom. The corpses were thrown on the dung-hill behind the
bam. I have seen that liAHN loaded his pi&tol after this incident, but I
have not seen that he fired a shot. After this incident we marched to
the camp KIEL-HASSEE without any further occurrances.
Although I saw ipy 2 French fraiends on the first day, I have not seen them
again. I asked another Frenchman where they were, and I heard that they
had been transported off.

Pollsb. Forces, of War Orimes (brovcp (HWh) Field Investigation Seotion, at
MHTSa?3ia.JfiSR this 28th day of Mar 47.
I, Henry W§X-,l Imve been informed that I am not forced to answer the iua-
stions, but that anything i say vdll be taken domi in writing aiid raay be used
as evidence. T make this statement voluntarily, without the use of force or
promise of reward.
I am Heavy KSH£S, born in HAJ^iaTBiSE/Holatein, on 1 Oct 1902. 1 am God fear"
ing, of German nationality, criminal policeman by profession, married, and
have one child. I have been a member of the PiSDAP since 19.33 nnd joined th®
S3 in 1939.
After leaving dementasr)/ school, I attended a preparatory school for HCOs.
After the Revolution, I served in several private corps, and was then enrolled
in the Army, m 1924 I joined the Police force, and. was transferred to th®
Gestapo in" 1936. In 1941 I was promoted to Krim. Sek, I ma arrested on the
15 May 45.
m the course of nty duty during the war, I carried out "severe" interrogations
in about 10 cases; these consisted in the man bending over and being beaten
oxi his seat with a stick fey me or by an official on By orders. In 1942 BSlKESf
officials instituted a method that consisted of putting sticks in between the
fingers and than aquaesing the fingers. The hands, during the course were to
strong handcuffs. I employed this method several times, I also tried to e
a thigh clamps, but I abandoned that method as it did not produce the de-
al ered result.
I was present at executions of Russians on 4 separate occasions. Three times
the victims were men and the 4th time, woman were involved. On 2 occasions
I fired, and the other 2 times X .gerved as guard. The first time was to early
autumn 1943, when 11 Russians were shot for plunder; at that tim© I was only
there as a guard. The second time about C Russians ware shot, I also first*
on that occasion. Tiie third time there were about 6 Russians again, and I
fired again. In both these cases the Russians concerned had been plundering.
I remember that apart from myself jHsfSDlES was also present. The 4th time was
in autumn 1944, when 5 Russian women Yirere involved. At that time I was atand—
ing on guard at a distance of about 1GG m. I think I can remember that HASDGE
fired on that occasion. I dib not know who gave the orders for the executions.
Txi summer or autumn 1914- I ordered PAJetEK to suonut a list of people who had
behaved coimunisticjally in any way whatsoever. These people were to be arr®3-
ted in the event of an especial situation arising. In the first half of April
1945 X was ordered to come into the office of my chief, BQOKEIMJSSN, yho told
me that the order had coma through that a liut of th© dangerous and less dan-
gerous prisoners had to be mad®. H® told m© tnat in case of oeoupation the
less dangerous 'prisoners were to fee released and the clangorous to bs evacua-
ted. Together with BOGESlliSNH we added about 20 names to the "daiigerous3 list.
It was only later that I learned that these people were executed to KETOTGAME,
I do not know who gave the order for the execution, as conmunications with
IEHCiM were, at that time, almost completely severed. I presume that the order
originated from a HAMBURG detachment. I should like to add that all powers of
the R3HA had at that time been transferred to the HSSFF.
That la all I have to say.

I, Henri HELMS, have been told that 1 am not compelled to make a statement
unless I so wish, but that any statement that I make will be written down
and may be used as evidence at any tine in the future. I am making tnis
statement of my own free will, and not under compulsion or persi©sion, or
because of promises or reward.
'I am Henri HELMS, born on the 1st October 1902 in HALSSENBEK. I believe in
God, am of German nationality and my profession is that of an official in
tne criminal police. I am married and nave one child. I was a Member of the
kHSDAi since 1933, and of tue S3 since 1939.
I want to maKe the following supplementary statement to my statements of
the 2b.3. anu of the 1.4.1947:-
As 1 nave stated previously, 1 renemsber the shooting of 11 Russians in
WINDSBERGEH/EIDL'LSTEDT in the autumn of 19 43. 1'hese prisoners had been
brought from the EUHLSBUETiEL prison. We were told that they were to be
shot because of plundering after air-raids. At that time I did duty in a
cordon of sentries. It is possible that I saw then TE3SMAH, the commandant
of FUHLSBUETTEL, at that spot. At about tne same time I took part in the
shoo-ting of six Russians. At that occasion I was one of tuose who did the
actual shooting. I fired a rifle from a distance of 10 meters on the ajKdExx
command of an S3 Officer. These people, too, were to be shot for plundering
I also remember tne shooting of 5 Russian women in the autumn of 1344. As
I have previously stated, at tuat time I did only sentry duty ana learneu
only later on tnat these women had been killed by being snot ini the neck.
Furthermore I had been ingormea th^Pt the women had been shot for sabotage
ana oecause tuey uad formed a comminist cell.
ft remember that I was once sent to LUEWEBURCr, were I nau to do cordoning
duty during tne execution of a role. This man was hanged. The reasons fox
it are not known to me. I do not remember the date.
In the spring of 1944 I took a transport consisting of 4 to 5 German Com-
munists (one woman was amongst tuem too) to MEUEKGAMmE. I only took these
peo le into the camp and was not present at the execution.
I was handling itax&xx&ax&aHXKKixBa the cases concerning the Gesta o Departe
merit Communism - Marxism, and I worked under the commissar BOCKELMANE. Wuy
I was picked to do cordoning-off duty at the mentioned executions, I don’t
know. These duties could equally well have been carried out by an oi-ainary
33-man. I believe, however, that the reason was the shortage of men in our
departement.

I remember tnat at the begiiuiing of April 1945 l or enci of March) commissar
BOCKELMANh received at* oraer coiicerniiig tiie evacuation of prisons. Accor-
ding to this oraer ue was to split the prisoners in nis uepartement into
two groups: the dangerous ana tne tarmless ones. I, together with the
commissar BOCKELMAKf, made out a list of tnose persons wlfipm I considered
dangerous. This took a snort time aud we wrote tne names down ourselves.
I diu not sonsult ar^ybody in this matter, not even PANnEK. Commissar
BOCKELMABh told me at the time tnat icuaxH the less dangerous persons should
be released in case of an occupation. After the capitulation I learned
that those persons, whom we had classed as "dangerous", haa1 been trans-
ferred to NEUEEGAMME and had been executed there. But 1 had nothing 4,0 do
with that.
I was arrested on the 15tn May 1945.

Ich, Henri HELiiB, bin belehrt worden, class ioh nicht gezwun- I
gen bin, eineAussage zu machen, dass aber jede Aussage, die
ich ® che, niedergeschrieben wird und in Zukunft als Beweis- I
mateial benutzt werden kann. Ich mache diese Aussage freiwil-
lig, ohne Zwang octer Versprechen von persoenlichen Vorteilen.
Ich bin Henri HELMS, geboren am 1. Okt. 19o2 in HALSTENBEK.
Ich bin gottglaeubig. Ich bin deutscher Nationalitaet, von
Beruf Kh. minalbeamfcer. Ich bin verheiratet und habe ein Kind
Ich habe seit 1933 der NSDAP und salt 1939 der SS angehoert.
In Ergaenzung meiner Aussagen vom 28.3. uad 1.4.1947 habe ich
noch Folgendes zu sagenS-
Wie ich schon frueher gesagt habe, erinnereich mich an die lr-
schiessung von 11 Russen in WINDSBERGEN/EIDELSTEDT im Her-bst
194-3. Diese Gefangenen warden vom Gefaengnis FUHLSBUETTEL ge-
bracht. Uns wurde gesagt, dass sie wegen Pluenderung nach den
Luf tangriffen .ersehossen werden sollten. Ich habe damals Ab-
sperrdienst gemacht. Esist moeglich, dass ich d ort auch TE8S-
MANN, den Kommandanten von FUHLSBUETTEL, gesehen habe. Unge-
faehr zur gleichen Zeit naskhm ich an der Erschiessung von 6
Russen teil. Dieses Mai habe ich persoenlich mitgeschos sen.
Ich habe mit einem Ge?/ehr geschossen aus einer Entfernung von
1o Metern auf Kommando ei nes SS-Offiziers. Di se Leute sollter
eberfalls wegexi Pluenderung erschossen werden. Ich erinnere
mich auch an die Erschiessung von 5 russlschen Frauen im Herbst
1944. wieich schon sagte, habe ich .damals auch Posten gestanden
und nur spaeter hat man mir gesagt, dass diese Frauen durch
GenieckschiB sse getoetet worden waeren. Man hat mir fernerhin
berichtet, dass die Frauen wegen Sabotage und Bildung einer
kommunistischen Zelle erschossen wurden.
Ich erinnere mich, dass ich einmal nach LUEN3BURG geschickt
wurde, wo ich waehrend einer Exekution eines Polen Absperr-
dienst leisten musste. Der Mann wurde gehangt. Die Grunde hier-
fuer sind mir nicht bekannt. An das Datum kann ich mich nicht
erinner n.
Im Fruehjahr 1944 habe ich ei. nen Transport, der aus 4-5
deutschen Kommunisten (es war auch sine Frau dabei) bestand,
nach NBUEB1AMME gebfacht. Ich habe diese Leute nur ins Lager
gebracht und bin waehrend der Sxakution nicht anwesend gewesen.
Ich war als Sachbearbeiter im Gestapo-Dezernat Kommunismus -
Marxismus, und ich arbeitete unter Kommissar BGCKELMANN. '//arum
ich bei den erwaehnten Exekutionen zu Absperrdienst, der eben-
so gut von einem einfachen SS-Mann haette ausgefuehrt werden
koennen, herangezogai wurde, weiss ich nicht. Ich glaube, der
Grund dafuer war, dass wir sehr wenige Leute auf unserer Dienst
stelle waren.﻿Ich erinnere mich, dass Komraissar BOCKELIMM Bxjde Maerz
Oder Aafatig April 1945 Verbirdurg mit der Evakuieiti ng
voa Gefaeagnissen e inert Befehl be kata, die Haeftlin^e in
seinem Dezernat in 2 Grupper aufzuteilen, Gefaehrliche und
Harmlosa Ich habe mit aera Kommissar BOCKELMANU e ine Liste
von gefaehrlichen Personen von meinem Standpunkt aus aus-
gefertigt. das bat eine kurze Zeit gedauert. Wir haben
die Namen selbst aufgeschrieben. Ich habe mich in dieser
Angeiegenheit mit niemandem, auch niciat mit PAMSK , beraten
Commissar BOGKELMANN hat mir dabei gesagt, dass die Leute,
die weni.ger gefaehrlich waren, eatlassen warden sollten
im Falle der Besetzung. Mach der Kap itulati on habe ich ge-
hcert, dass die Leute, die wir als gefaehrlich aufgefuehrt
haben, nach MEtr.''MGAAF/i; ueberfuehrt und dart exekutiert
.u.rden. Damit hatte ich aber nichts zu tun.

In 1942 I was conscripted to the Gestapo as a driver.
I was driver to Dr. KHEUZER chief of the Stapo Detachment
HAMBURG. In 1944 a number of the cars were taken off the
road due to lack of petrol, and after that I was employed
