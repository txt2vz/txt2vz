In 1936 attended a school for Intelligence and Ciphers,﻿(b) Service in Slovak Army :
After dismemberment of Czechoslovak Republic, I was
accepted into the Slovak Army in the rank of 1st Lt.
and was attached to 2nd Department of the former VI
Corps of the Czechoslovak nrmy, in which unit I took
an active part in the fighting against Hungarians in .
March and April, 1939.

of the 3*'d Infantry Division.
*	1st August appointed chief of the 2nd Dejjt. in the

1.9. - 6.10,39 took part in the expedition against
Poland.
15.2.40-15.2.42 attended Military Staff College, At
the outbreak of the German-Russian war lectures were
suspended for three months and students were attached
to German Field Units. In this period I was attached
to the Intelligence Dept, of H.Q, Slovak Arny.
After the end of the Staff College twelve students
were attached to German Field units in 6 Army. I was
attached to I.R.134, 44 Infantry Div,, and later on to
HQ 298 Inf Div. Many of the students were slightly or
seriously wounded, I was wounded on my left foot by
splinter and was removed to Slovakia in May 1942.
After release from the hospital I was attached to the

appointed chief of G-2, 1st Slovak Motorised Division.
June, 1943 I was replaced and returned to Slovakia.
15th September, 1943 appointed chief of G-2, Ministry
of National Defence, which appointment I held until the
day of insurrection, 1st September, 1943 on which day
the Slovak Army changed its name to Czechoslovak Army.
In Banska Bystrica I acted as chief of G-2 HQ 1st
Czechoslovak Army for 2 days only, because of the lack
of officers trained for command of higher units I was
then appointed C.C. 1/ll Mountain Group/3de, during
the most critical period of fighting.
(c) Intelligence Service for Czechoslovak Goverment in
London and for the Allies.
At the beginning of August 1939 my uncle General Viest
Rudolf escaped to London, to take part in the fight against Germans
and the Fascist clique in Slovakia. Since this time I worked in the
Czechoslovak Resistance Group ’FLORA' which was collecting intellig-
ence on polotics, warfare and economy for the Czechoslovak govern-
ment in London. Chief of the Group was Mrs.VIEST wife of Ing.Duson
VIEST who was a brother of the general.
From military personnel collaborating were Colonel KISS and
Capt. Josef PETERKA, chief of the Intelligence Dept, of the Main HQ
Gendarmerie.Group ’FLORA' was a large body with many members in
Protectorate Bohemia and Moravia, Intelligence reports from Hungary,
Austria, eastern front, partly from Roumanda and Poland were my
responsibility. The greatest activity of 'ELORA' dates from the
beginning of 1944 when I was appointed chief of G-2 Ministry of N.D.
because thus we knew everything.﻿-3-
I wish to point out that I did not want to
appointment as chief of 02, but was induced to it by
irom the Czechoslovakian Government in London,
take over the
a consent given
, APrilJ there came from the London Ministry of N.D. .
Major lubiiia who acted as Liaison'Officer. With this officer 'FLORA'
ano. I were closely working.
■^®Porcs to uondon were sent in diplomatic bag via Sweden,
Switzerland and Turkey and in 1344 directly by wirel&ss.-stations,
I should like to add that I was personally in contact "with
o cliei croups ox the resistance inoveuient end I was supplying them with
reports and news on measures taken by Germans against us.
SOme three months prior to the insurrection, May 1944, I got
through the help of the Slovak communists in touch with the Russians,
to whom I reported on Hungarian and. German units in action on the
eastern front. We were in touch with the Czechoslovak Military Attache
in Moscow through the intermediary of my cousin 1st Lt, Michal BaYLOVIC.
I fought the German Intelligence Service by all means at my
• disposalj and sought to create confusion by means of faked reports.
The greater part of places bombed in Hungary, Austria-and
Slovakia by the.-Allied Air Forces were bombed following-reports of ‘FLORA*,
(d) Preparation of the insurrection and military
activities against Germans responsible.
At the end of 1943 the Czechoslovak Government in London-asked -
all resistance.^roups to earmark a higher officer far the post of C.O.
of Slovak Army which had to take arms against the Germans at a proper
moment. The greater part of Groups suggested Lt.Col.GOLlM as the best
suitable and because he was chief of Staff at HQ Land, Field, Army in
Bansi-a Bystrica, With GOLIAN many Slovak officers were collaborating
ani^ took their part in the fighting against the Germans. I was in touch
With G-OLIAN personnally and wireless working on secret code. In August
1944 strong units of Partisans increased their activities especially
attacking Germdn lines of communication leading through Slovakia, As
slovaL authorities were rather passive or helping partisans, Germans
jhreatened to occupy Slovakia, General CATLOS, war criminal, then
minister of ri.D. started also to organise insurrection against Germans.
In some direction Colonel HISS and I were working upon General CATLOS
o make matters easier for GGLI4J.M. We happened to deceive him. Reports
'n'-,.?‘:n'G'rease<^ activity of partisans and' on preparatory activity of General
AlLOS were sent by GOLIAH to uondon and the Czechoslovak Government
as asked for instructions. Wo wore told to resist occupation and
should the Germans attempt it to start fighting.
- 26,8,1944 ~ General GOLIAN issued orders to stand by.
28,8,1944 - sniping started close to the frontier and on
1.9,1944 the whole of Slovakia was in insurrection, I left
Bratislava on the 1st September 1941k following direct order of General
GOLIAN, collecting up to this date intelligence reports.﻿.2^
For two days I was in charge of 0-2 and then took over the
command of the Mountain Group in the area CERVEDh SKALA-TELGART.
The fighting was at the start rather unlucky. Germans succeeded
vyith strong Panzer Units to smash and take prisoner two divisions
in the north-eastern part of Slovakia. But at the midst of Septembi
we have stopped G-ermans on all fronts, we were encircled and in
some directions or sectors we have defeated them and pushed back.
Fight for life lasted until the end of October when we were smashed,
Remnants of the 1st Army took to the woods where they were partly
re-organised and started fighting the part:Lsans-fashion* That
lasted until.the- arrival of the Russian Army.
On the 6th September there came a Russian-mission from
Marshal KORIEV Army from Kijev under command of Major STTOEHSKX^In'
midst of September by .air from Italy the British and.American
Military Missions
Members of the British Mission : Major SEHMOR, Ist/Lt'"-
WALLIS* Lt*. STIFFS, one Sergeant anlJPte MULLER.
Members of the American Mission: Navy Capt.GRUNN^-CIiiefU
Navy Capt. GAULE, 1st/Lt. MULLER,-.Lt.MEKENS.-and other 13
members —. total 17 men.
(e) How I was captured.
Dispersed by many fights we rallied in the woods to the
north of POLOMKA- seme 70 km east of Banska Bystrica, Our party had
28 men and 1 woman, British,,.American and Slovaks. On thc^26,12.J7A4
about 8.30 a.m. we were surrounded by an SS Group abQU±-_250 men
strong^and after short bloody fight taken prisoners* Some got. away, -
Lt.STIFFS, a British Sergeant, two American NCOs and five Slovaks.
Founded were: Navy Capt GRUNN and GAULE and I. When captured we
were beaten by SS men with Handgranates/Steilhandgranate, and whips.
Then we-were robbed of all our belongings and even of.Identity Lords,
Then we were taken to SD/Sicherchaits Dienst/Command in Brezna nad
Hronem where the wounded, GRUNN, GAULE, STANEK, were separated and
sent after a short questioning, particulars, to the local Hospital,
94 Gebirgs, Div,, from where we were sent to Banska Bystrica, where
we were imprisoned in the vaults of the local military hospital. In-
Brezno nad Hhonem, Major SEHMOR was interrogated after me and I have
the impression that he was beaten from what I heard through the walls.
28*12,1944 - all the others were put into prison in Banska Bystrica
and so were we wounded ones. In Banska Bystrica Americans only were
interrogated.
29.12.19^ by order of SS CBERSTURl-fflANNFUHRER WITESSKA, G-in-C of
Security, we all were transported to BRATISLAVA where we arrived at
2130 p,m. At once we were interrogated in SD house in GUNDULICOVA
ULICA, and at 2,30 a.m. next day put in county jail separated one
from the other, I was put in cell 364.
30,12,1944 1 was interrogated by Abwehr Officers, Counter Intelligence,
Lt.Col.KROH and Major FRABELL. They inquired into the activities
of General GATLOS, Minister of N.D. and in his preparation of
insurrection and about counter intelligence service against the
Germans, They behaved correctly. •
January 6th I was transported to a dark cell in SD house where I was
kept until the 15th January, 1945» I was constantly interrogated
very often during the night. By following SS QBERSTURl-mANNFUHRSR
DR. WITESSKA, especially about General CATLOS, General MALAR, Gene. .1
JURECH, DR. KARVAS, Governor of the Slovak National Bonk, and about
counter intelligence activities directed against Germany,﻿•o.
SS HAUPTSTURMPUHRER PAEPE from the counter intelligence
service. He interrogated me only in the night time, in his H.Q.
in oUnEKGVii ULICn, Prior to his stay in Slovakia he was active for
two years in LWOW, He enquired into Intelligence Service personnel
about Communists and people supposed to be working against the
Germans, Although they threatened me with third degree interroga-
tion, they never used it. It was quite easy to deceive them by
false information because they were poorly informed.
SS OBERSTURMFUHRER E&HNER of the IV Dept S.D., a very stupid
man. He sought details of the fighting and of partisan activities.
Then about the activities of the Czechoslovaks in exile.
16th January, 1945> together with my Pte HRUSKA I was
transported to BERLIN, Main H.Q, of the Gestapo, Albrechtstrasse 0.
What happened to my British and American friends I have no
notion. The only news was given to me by Pte HRUSKA to the effect
that they were sent to some other place on the 7th January, 19‘4-5-
In the Gestapo jail in Cells 58 and 51 I was detained, until
3rd March, 194-5* always in isolation. Interrogation was made by the
IV b 2 a Dept., by S.S. UNTERSTURMPUHRER STAKE, S.S. fflERSTURMBAM-
FUHRER Kurt LISCHKA, S.S. STURMBANMUHRER von SCHOENENSEIPEN and
S.S.OBERSTURMPUHRER JAHN.
Interrogation was, on the whole, correctly done and concerned
with subjects listed in enclosure 1.
3rd January 194-5* I was chained and escorted to Concentration
Camp ORANIENBURG where I was kept in isolation in Cell No, 4-5.
10th January, 1945* I was once more transported to the
Gestapo jail in Albrechtstrasse, 8, BERLIN where 1 lived in Cell No,
3'i until 8th April, 194-5* when, together with Mr. KARVAS, German Colonel
Von BONIN, Lt.Col.SCHLABENDORF, Dr. Von FLUEGGE and EDQUIST, we were
transported to the jail of the Concentration Camp at FLOSSENBURG,
where I was isolated in cells Nos. 5 and 26 respectively.
From BERLIN together with us travelled to FLOSSENBURG so
called Liquidating Commission Gestapo, which was in charge of the
execution of political prisoners. Executions were made without
sentence. Chief of the Commission was S.S.STANDARTENFUHRER
HOGENKQPE, members, S.S,OBERSTURlviFUHRBR KUKALn, O.C. Gestapo jail
in Albrechtstrasse and one other S.S.HAUPTSTURMFUHREE whose name I
don’t know. There were also two criminal commissars with this comm-
ission, who were in charge of interrogations. The commission
started its function soon after arrival at FLOSSENBURG, I suspect
that we too had to be executed and were saved only owing to a quick
advance of U.S. troops,
15th April, 1945, I'was escorted together with a small
group to DACHAU where I was put together with the group into a hut
for Senderhaftlinge.
24th April, 1945 some of us were transported to INNSBRUCK
27th April, 1945 to NIEDERHOF
30th April, 1945 to HOTEL LAGO DI BRAIES where on the 4th May
1945 we were liberated by the U.S.Army.

t﻿(f) Cruelties Committed by the Germans.
(i) In Slovakia during the insurrection and after
C.-in-C, of all S.S. units was S.S.CBERGRUPPENPUHRER, General S.S.
BERGER who was later replaced by S.S. OBERGRUPPMFUHHER LOEFFLE.
Both were renowned for drastic measures taken against opponents
cina for their cruelty. These two generals jpsued orders 'not to
take prisoners'.
On the 6th September, 1944 S.S. Training Battalion from •
MILOVICE surrounded the village of TELGART )set fire to it and the
flying inhabitants were murdered by machine guns and automatic
pistols. It is not possible to give the exact number of killed
people because the Germans took them away.
This bloodshed I have seen through my telescope and so
have my officers and O.Rs. We then took the village of TELGART
by storm and we found 32 killed civilians, i.e. 23 men, 7 women,
'-.iid a chi lor on. Of the 23 men, there were 13 soldiers who were
flung in a spring. Women were for the greater part violated before
they were killed; this was proved by the Chief Medical Officer of
cne 1/II Mountain Group, DR. VALOVIC, who examined the bodies on
the spot.
In the middle of September, 1944, German Panzer Units
penetrated into the town of EILIEn. S.S.Men attracted chidren with
chocolate and then shot them. This is from official-evidence
..collected by G~2 H.Q.Ist Czechoslovak Army.
nt the end of November a pert of the village of HEEPA was
burnt down and 13 inhabitants shot on the grounds that they were
helping soldiers of the 1st Czechoslovak army. I saw it personally.
Appartements of Czechoslovak Officers were sacked and
plundered. Some families were shot. So was the family of Colonel
TALSKY. Officially recorded at H.Q. 1st urny.
Villages between ZILINn and STSCNO burnt down by S.S.Units,..
Residents, women children and old folk, by greater part hanged.
Officially recorded by H.Q. 1st Army. Cases were plentiful and
terrible, and I hope that Czechoslovak Government certainly shall
place at the disposal of the Allies a summary report on crimes
committed by the Germans.
(ii) In Concentration Camps.
I learned nothing at ORANIENBURG because I was
held in isolation.
FLOSSENBURG - personally I saw nothing. My only news comes
from a barber who attended me and who. knew me personally. His
name is KRALICEK and he comes from BENESOV near PRAGUE."
He told me that:
FLOSSENBURG was so called extermination Cafiip, In September 1944
there were 300 Jews killed by gas. Further there were detained
1u British Officers but the informant did nc? know any details
about them.
DACBMU: I spent only a short time there and ha've not seen anyt
I only heard that on 16th j.pril, 194-5 French General DELESTRAi
with seme more officers wore shot. Details are known to KGHLT
and WAUER PAUL who were in this camp for a lojager time.

REPORT on reason of detention, way of treatment
in prison and concentration camps and on
observations made by :-

JOSEF ROZSEVAC - RysH
JOSEF BURDA
Journalist, Born 1.11.1901,
Nationality Czeck, Czechoslovak subject,
Bachelor,
Address: Praha II, Petrska 1.
'Rys1 is an assumed name, it is being
used here because it is short and. easy
to pronounce.
Proprietor and Manager of 'EEPKA FILM. LTD.'
Born 20.12.1893, Nationality Czech,
Czechoslovak subject, married.
Reason for detention
Critic of the Regime.
Me were leading members of the Czech cultural and political move-
ment •VLrtJKA' j^Plag. The movement was promoted on the 7th March,
1930, activities were suspended in November. 1938 and organisation
dissolved so that all following activities	in a sense illegal
although tolerated by the Czech Protectorate Government and by^the
German authorities. The movement have published a periodical 01
the same name, ’VLAJh-M ,• either as a daily paper or weekly
according to circumstances.
1,	In March, 1939, we were invited'to. enter as a whole in an
organisation known as NARODNI SOURUCENSTVI, National Uni by .which
we declined, to safeguard freedom of action, after the creation
- of the Protectorate, it was our aim to win the confidence of the
German authorities and to exploit this confidence to the full for^
the benefit of national entity. Such confidence we never achieved,
even if our activity, judging by appearances, bore marks of
•collaboration with the Germans'! because through then our real
intentions were visible. This waVs due to many negotiations, proposals,
refusals and protests, made on the ground of principles,
2,	In June 1939, when we learned of the decree promoting
official use of two languages, German and Czech, whica was then being
prepared, we submitted to the office of the Reichsprotector a written
protest, to abandon this project or to give priority to .he Csecn
language, should there bo no other way. Protest was never answere .
3,	In the autumn of 1939, we have submitted another v/ritten
protest against, the introduction of traffic post, signboards
written in German only. We were told that this was a temporary
measure only - which then stayed.
A.	in the autumn of the same year a representative.of the
movement, J.BUKD,., was .summoned to the Chief of the political
department of the Gestapo in PRAGUE, DR.oCMWDER, and i/a.s asked
that the movement should place at the disposal of the Gestapo ai.s
intelligence reports ana 10 to 12 Intelligence officials 01 to
movement, which arrangement should be beneficial to the.movement.
This proposal was turned down with an explanation that iroo. ig^-i-c
service of the movement must serve exclusively inner requirements,
and. that the movement must a If ice with proper financia nwc-.no.

X ^:n October, 1 93S1 we	£.037 aa i^Ti](jawTawtft»j frh f\\Q
Germaa State- minister, lator Cerman minister for Bohemia and
Moravia, S.S.GRUIOTW-ffiER IC,H.K£j#:j to whom wanted to
oarmiunioate many complaints concerning trespasses of Gorman
Officials, and at tho same time submit proposals which would
help to make the life of Czechs in the Protectorate beatable.
As the date of the interview was not fixed for a considerable
time, we proceeded at tho beginning of November, 1939, to
elborate this matter in the form of a Memorandum, which had to
be sent directly to HITLER, which subsequently was done through,
the intermediary of the then German Ambassador to SSSR Graf
SCfflJLENBURG. A copy of tho memorandum was in December 1939
delivered to H.K.FRANK as it was dangerous to pass his office.
2-3 copies of the Memorandum were seized by the Gestapo at the
time of Mr.RYS arrest on the 20th January, 19^3, Probably Mr
RYS will still have one copy at his disposal.' Neither from BERLIN
nor from PRAGUE the memorandum was answered. It was hint®d out
from the office of the ReichsproWctor rather indirectly’that the
Memorandum was accepted with mixed feeling ,
On the 15th November, 1939, finally the interview with H.K.FRANK
took place. There were RYS, BURBa, and Count THUN. The interview
yielded no results. At this occasion I said to Frank, RyS) "We
are not coming because wo are scored neither to ask for something.
It is clear to us that if the German Reich, will follow the ideology
of the National Socialism as she heralds then the same principles
must apply to the Czech nation, and therefore nothing may happen
to us or, should the Reich follow the way of German Imperialism,
then it is a question of time only," FRANK did not answer.
6.	In the spring of 1940, we have been invited by the Culture
political leader of the Reichsprotectorate office, K, Von GREGORY,
to take part in Czech broadcasting half an hour programme of tho
MELNIK Station, In negotiation took part BUREm and Count THUN,
For our participation we fixed one condition i,e. that we shall
have independent programme to the exclusion of other partakers
such as Mr,TUSCANY etc. This was not accepted.
7.	Out of lack of financial means we wore forced to limit .
or temporarily stop publication of our daily ’’WAIKa', That was
reproached to us from the German officials as sabotage, German
Press Chief VOLFGANG WOLFRAMM von WOLMAR and Regierungsrat Ing.
Ant.ZAHKL, On this matter I and RYS have been summoned in the
summer of 1940 by Ing,ZANKL, then Deputy leader of cultural
political department of the Reichsprotector office, who made the
following proposal, " Come every first of the month to me and I
shall give you, but you only, 25,000 R.fc. for Press."
I replied, "Our board was always clean let it be by it," My refusal
was accepted with disappointment and since that time a bigger
mistrust was apparent.
Since that time up to the Autumn of 1941, negotiation with
HACHu, and January, 1942 resp,, entry of M0RAVEC and HRUBY into the
Government, our activity tolerated by the German authorities
obviously for the purpose of close observation. We were publishing
our ne?/spaper BUT under a censorship much harder than applied to
other papers, wo arranged public meetings that were often
prohibited in the very last moment by German authorities. Other-
wise we limited ourselves to sending in protests, demands, such as
for the release of Czech High School Students, of whom eventually
40,were released in 1941, although otherwise all our efforts
were fruitless. In this period many of our supporters were
prosecuted either by the police fcrce or tried by courts for
political activities; RYS was sentenced to 14 days detention in 1940
for critic of the Government, we therefore asked for an auduwao^
of DR, HACIift, 33. pardon was promised and subsequently granted,
cancellation in conduct sheets, ht the meeting a participation of
,.../aome members of the﻿•3-
*
some members of the movement in the Government was mentioned. No
number was mentioned, RYS has an impression they ought to be 2-3.
To this RYS and I replied, "Wo don't claim any post in the Govern-
ment unless the following conditions would be respected; a real and
not only a written autonomy of Bohemia and Moravia; release of all
political and other prisoners and internees taken by German authori-
ties, when they come under Czech jurisdiction; ro-opening of Czech
High Schools."	The result was that on the 19th January, 1942,
MORiiVEC and HRUBY were accepted into the Government, im explanation
was given to me and RYS in March, 1942 by Chief 3.D„ in Erotootor&te
S.S.STiiND/iRTSNFUHRER BOEHM who communicated to me the desire of the
German authorities i.e. that we should co-operate with MORAVEC,
unconditionally. His words on this occasion were, "It was considered
whether you should go into the Government or MORAVEC, As you had
put forward conditions that were unacceptable, it was MOR/d/EC."
5«	With the entry of MOR^VGC into the Government a period of
open persecution of the movement begins, already in February, 1942
Minister MORAVEC appealed through ER.CEPHELLY, advocate of the
movement to place the movement at the disposal of his political
and propaganda organisation because he is the only Czech political
minister who is supported by the Germans. On this occasion he
offered to many officials cf the movement lucrative places in a
proposed organisation and payment of all debts of the movement.
To me and RYS ho offered the position of "Inspector General of
propaganda, Welfare, Councils." This offer was rejected with the
result that Germans and eiQRAVEC proceeded still harder and harder
against the movement as a whole and against single officials.
It was for us impossible to not criticise MORAVECs
activity, as a blind servant of the Germans against the interests
of the Czech nation which criticisms led to the following:-
(a)	18th April, 1942 - all organisatcry and public
activity of the movement was suspended for three
months. This I and RYS were told personally by
H.K,FRANK who added, "You with your Czech chauvinism
are far behind people with whom we collaborate and I
won’t stand any critic of the present regime, especially
not of MORnVECs activities, otherwise I shall send you
to a concentration camp".
(b)	On 20th July, 1942, after elapse of the period for
which the activities of the movement were suspended
I and RYS were summoned to the Chief S.D.BOEHM, who
told me that no further public or nrganisatory
activities shall be allowed. Publishing of the daily
"VLAJKA", and of a weekly pamphlet "Ilorrespondence" is
forbidden (the weekly 'Korrespondence' was a cyclostyled
pamphlet giving news and instructions to officials of
the movement of some 800 copies). On this occasion
BOEHM told me, "We won't arrest members of the movement
because we don't want to make national martyrs out of
you".
(c)	Already the next day, 21st July, 1942 JIRI NOVOTNY,
leader of the Youth VLAJIA was arrested. He died on
23rd February, 1943 in concentration camp TEREZIN,
(d)	On the'16th September, 1942 two officials of the move-
ment were arrested OLBRICH NOVOTNY and BSRNAT, Gestapo
Prison HAGUE IHNKRAC, OSVISDZIN, BUCIfflWAllDE.
(e)	3rd October, 1942 arrested solicitor of the movement
B.L.OLDRICII DUCIMC and, treasurer KAREL HOUBEK,
PANKRAC, TIIREZIN, DnCHMU.
(f)	1st November, 1942 G-crmm billeting officer ordered
evacuation of offices of the movement.
(g)	3rd November 1942 by order of the office of the Reich-
Protector many functionaries of the movement wore
despatched to Reich as forced labour through ARBEIT&iMT
up to the day of our arrest their number readiest 150.
(h)	20th January, 1943 we were arrested - RYS, BURDA.
In May 1943 during our absence the movement was
definitely dissolved.﻿/

Wcy of Treatraent in Prison and Concentration Gampa,
Yfe were arrested both on the same day - 20th January, 1943
in the afternoon. Search of the house and examination by Gestapo,
20th-23rd January, were purely formal,
1.	G-estapo Prison Prague-pahkrac 20.1, -- 23,3.1943,
Since the very beginning we were obliged alike all others -
outside our cell to stand always with the face -closoly to the wall.
Slightest movement or a misunderstood order, question etc,, were
followed by slaps, boxes, or kicks. Every movement was to bo made
at the trot. Guardians SD and bS for the greater part from Sudeten-
land have spoken German only although they evidently knew Czech;
they beat everyone- who did not understand or ask for the meaning.
They address everybody as 'thou'.
2,	On 23rd March 1943 we were transported together with 34 men
to the Concentration Camp at TEREZIN where we were dressed into
convicts^ garment, rests of different uniforms, had their hair
ehavod and were billeted in dark and damp rooms. When parading for
thework I and RYS got several slaps on the face by IINIERSGH4EEUKRER
IffiUBAdjER because I half shut my eyes against the sun. He was a rude
follow who liked to beat. We were both separated from the others
and put into the Jewish Group, where the treatment was especially
cruel. ’With this group we had to move running only behind the
groupran UMTERSCHiiRFUHRER STORCH, Sudetendeutsche, a butcher by
profession, who beat the last ones with a club whore he could hit
them. Standing in a row abreast we dug in manure in the field.
STORCh usually came every half hour and without any reason beat
whomever he fancied with a riding rod mostly all of us. During one
beat ho stopped at me and RYS and asked me in German, "Why are thou
detained?", "Per political reasons", "I shall teach you political
reasons, You are a spy" and. he smashed at me with the riding whip
over the back of the head. He smashed my right ear and for several
days there was blood in my urine. Then caught me by the neck and
strangled me, flung me down and went on kicking me. Then he went to
BURBA and asked him, "Is it your friend?'-^ BUHDa, "Yes", "So here
you are" and repeated the performance. After this there was no
more thrashing, but both of us were forced to work even in a down-
pour when the others could take cover. And this was on Saturday
when we' had no underwear being dressed in a shabby uniform only.
3«	29th March, 1943 we were returned in a lorry bad: to PRAGUE
and put into the -Gestarjo prison in KARLO'VE NAMESTI (Charles Square)
Treatment was the same as at PANKRAC; prison old; bad hygiene; 6
men in a cell sleeping on 4 matresses; lice,
4,	21st April,1943 we were taken back to PMNKRAC Prison. Here
we were put together in a cell with Emil SIROTEK who was at investi-
gations thrashed in a way that 0:1 his back of‘the neck, arms and thighs
big places were discharging and festering. In the bathroom we saw
many covered with huge blue spots on their heads and bodies. Prom
my co-convicts, RYS, it was VACLAV ROKYIn, from PRAGUE, who was
beaten with an iron rod over soles, his feet were swollen and soles
podded with blood, PRAHTISEK GROS, from PRAGUE, was repeatedly
during investigation tied down.
5.	On 26th May, 1943 we were transported in a prison waggon
from PRAGUE to DACHAU. In a small comportment we were crowded so
that it was impossible to stand, not enough air, sultry. We stopped
at CHEB where we spent the night in a military prison, then in HOP
and finally in HUM3URG when we spent another night. We were walked
to each of these three prisons and back chained five men in a row.﻿✓
*
-5-
6k Wo reached BuGILuU on the 28th May, 1943 at 19 o'clock.
In the courtyard in fiont of the bathrooms we were listed and got
our numbers, BUEBa 2^109, HYo 2^8111. Thonafter the transport of
70 men was taken to storehouse where we undressed. All our belong-
ingswere put in big paper bags. We wore led naked into bathrooms
were shaved all over the body, greased by some disinfector and were
issued with convicts underwear clothes, not stripes, but with K.L.
on the back and red stripe on trousers, and wooden shoes and were
billeted in Hut No,'l5^ arrivals. On the 30th May, 1943 and
BURDn wore led to the storehouse where we took off convict1s attire
put on out own underwear and suits and wo were taken to a so-called
Bunker which is literally a prison of the concentration camp
shortly denominated "K./i," i,e, jConmandstur merest. It is a long
jjround floor building of concrete built from east to west. Cells
in the southern side wea*© ■sche-tiul&d fetr Sonderhaflinge and S.S., on
the northern side for HarftlingS in detention. On the oo.at®rn .side
a part consisting^ of 14 cells is.-se-grogated. There were on our
orx*iv»l members of Roumanian Iron G-uard. On the western side
there is a small part sopar-at-ed too, whore there were clergymen
and padre NIMOELhER, We were allotted rooms, No,5 BURBA and No.6
HXS, Boors of our -cells were open all day and we were free to
visit each other. Twice a day a guardian came asking if we want to
take a walk. Courtyard was narrow space ! road-lik© space among
Buildings. Usually wo would take one hour walk. At the beginning
we were no-t allowed to talk to anybody. We were told by the man in
charge of the block that we were given status of Bonderhnfthings.
In due time we could take a walk at our discretion and were allowed
to see some of the Sonderhafthings. Excluded were members of the
Iron Guard, Any contact with Haftlings was forbidden. The opportunity
of meeting other Senderhaftlings depended on the mood and sometime
it was forbidden, the other time allowed. In January, 192+4 we got
a new coasmmder SS UNTEi^STURiiiFUIiRER STILLER. He came to stay till
the end. Our neighbours were: Lt.Gol, KcGRATH, Lt.Col.Eichard
STEEVENo, Count Alexander LAMQYSKI, Pole,Beacon Stepan SINGER,
75 years, left in December, 1943 for monastery Maria Trost, Canon
Nikolaus JANSEN of Aachen, transferred on 12th March 1945 to a block
designated for clery ho,26, Canow Johannes NEUHAUSLER, from Munich,
Dr .Michael HOECK from Munich, released on 5.4,45 together with
Cosbinian BOFMEISTER, superior of the Benedictine Monastery METEN,
Bayern, came to DACHAU in the Summer of 192+4, NOVAK P0P0VIC, Yugo-
slav counsellor of the Legation in Bucharest, came in August 1943-
In October seven Italians arrived: Minister of Transport, Count CINI
left in January 192+4 for sanitarium; chief and deputy chief of
police, names unknown, left after 14 days for unknown destination,
Chief of Carabinieri General MARAFA, died 12,12.43 in hi3 cell,
heartstroke; Colonel GA1LI and his ADC, Major CLEMENTE, both left
May-June', 192+4} senator, name unknown, of 79 years, left in
January 1944- to unknown destination. In April 192+-4 arrived Dutch
State Secretary for War VAN DYCK and German Count PLBTTENBURG,
Paradise, In May there came HANSEN and KLAVENOS, Norwegian who
spent three years in a penitentiary and were before Easter '1945 taken
away by International Red Cross and DIMITRIJ TQMALEVSKIJ.
In June 192+-4 shortly before the departure of GALLI and CLEMENTE
an. Italian Lt.Col Davide FERERA arrived, who got for a batman an
Italian 1st Lt, of the Christian name Fernando. Lt.Col,FERERA exchanged
him in agreement with UNTERSTURMFUHRER STILLER for General GARIBALDI
who was working in a group assigned to cleaning ways and surroundings
of the camp, January, 1945.
In February came Padre KAREL KUKEL from KOENIGSBERG, Paradise.
In March French Bishop PIQUET from Clermont Fernand andGeneral
DELESTRAIN, it is daid that he was shot on 16.4.1945. Time to time
a prominent German was interned in the camp, Von RECHBERG, professor
ZIEGLER from Munich, business man HUBER etc. but they were released
after a short stay, SS Officers too were serving their terms here
or were imprisoned on remand, NCOs and OR imprisoned on remand
numbered some 10-16 men
i﻿t
In April, 1945 concentration of donderhaftlings from different
concentration camps to DACHAU*started. On 17, 24, and 26,4,45
v/e were gradually transported to IM3BEUCK, 27.4, to NIEDSRdorf
VILLAdASSA, 30.4« to xAGO DI BRAIES and from there after the
arrival of the U.d.Army, on 4th May, 1945 to Verona, Naples and
Capri.
Conditions in and our_ obsgT'vat^ions
Being held in K.A, rather isolated we have not had opportunity to
see events. If some important event took place or if a new person
arrived to K.A, we were either ordered to stay in our rooms or locked
in. In spite of it we were aware when convicts wer. being taken
out of their cells for execution. In March 1944 two cells No,63 and
65 opposite to ours were devlded by concrete walls into so called
Stenbunlcers whore a man could stand only. Into those cells oven
women and girls were locked in for a period of 3} 8 and 12 days.
They were members of labour group working on the land,
Claps and blows administered by guardians to detainees wo could
just hear and lamentation of people who were beaten, but wo seldom
were in a position to see it, SCHAKPUHSER LUETZLER for instance has
beaten one detainee with a club all the way across the courtyard,
which I saw, RTS. UNTERSCHAKPUHRER HEKNIWAM from FRANKFURT on Rhine
often has beaten prisoners in E,A. and and boasted that he took part
in at least 50 executions, IIAUpTSGIiARFUflRER WERNER, spent 12 years
with Sb in DaCHAU, has also very often beaten prisoners, SS MANN
vi/SNOKOVdlll, maybe LENCKOVCKI, flogged a naked prisoner in the guard
room. During our walks we heard from bathrooms administration of
23 counted blows. Those punishments took place every Wednesday at
13 o’clock. Sometimes there were as much as 20 people involved.
In the camp there mas an experimental medical post with SS
HAUKCSTURiviFUHRER RnSOHER as C,G., it is alleged that he was shot in
the back of his neck in a coll of 1 ,.1. on 26,4,45 after he has been *
transported to DACHAU from another camp during concentration of
Sondcrhaftlings in April, This SS Official summoned in 'Idle summer
of 1943 to the guard room two young detainees, one German, one
Russian, and handed to each of them a glass of water in which he had
previously put some drug. Laughing he made them to drink. The Russian
was found next morning dead in a puddle of blood. The German was alive
as he put a finger into his throat soon after arrival to his cell
and vomitted the drink.
In the winter of 1943/44 one IJnterscharfuhrer daily took out of
K.A, four young prisoners, 15 to 18 years old. They were two Russian,
one Czech and one Pole, They stayed away from 3 to 12 and from 13
to 17 o'clock. This lasted about three weeks. We saw how these
men looked miserable, and further they wore the ’worse far walking. We
learned that they are forced to walk all the long hours barefooted
in the snow and at the end of the experimental period they were forced
to sit naked submerged up to their necks in the brook which was
close to the camp. We hoax'd afterwards lamentations from their cells,
saw terribly swollen joints and how they were taken on stretchers
out of |C,A. Former Kalfaktor PAUL WEUER knows details. The lost
day in DACHAU we both were in clothing storehouse. In front of the
house there were laying some 80-100 corpses dressed or semi-dressed
prisa’ners. ¥e met by chance a Czech known to KOHLENTHiAu, who was
working as a movie operator. He said to us, "This show we have here
every day. They are deads from the labour group working on the land
they are being carried here undressed and put into the crematorium11.
These are the few pictures from the concentration camp which
our limited possibilities of observation allowed us, to draw.

particirjating in tlse subjection of thousands of civilian nationals
and of members of the Armed Forces of nations then at war with the
then German Reich to cruelties and mistreatment including killings,
beatings, tortures, starvation, and other abuses and indignities,
will be tried by a General Military Govenrment Court at Dachau,
Gemany, car.-mencing about 15 Hovcmber 1945*
2.	Inasmuch as some British nationals were involved as victims
of the atrocities alleged to have been ccsvaitted by the accused and
because of the importance of this proceeding, it is believed the trial
will be of interest to that government. Accordingly it is requested
that you ask the War Crimes Office of the Judge Advocate Section of
the British Arngr of the Rhine to invite tbs appropriate British
authorities to have present throughout the course of the triad observers
from that nation, who, because of the limitation of facilities, necessarily
must not exceed two (2) in number.
3.	Adequate accomodations will be made available for the messing
and quartering of such representatives at Dachau or MurIda and it is
requested that not later than three (3) days prior to the date of the Court
will convene for the trial of the case the War Crimea Branch, Judge
Advocate Section, Headquarters Eastern Military District, be notified of
the names of the two (2) observers who will be present at the trial and

After the two had been.interro-ated separately they were peroatted to cor,
suit each other. Infor/.iation thus furnished by the two jointly hm been
included at the approhriato pl-oes in this report without special .untion
of who supplied it.
EARLY HISTORY.
%	NETT •was born the oo-n of a Tost Office Official in 7500HUM but loved at an
early ape to WASSTEH'f near >ESCHHTJE, where ho attended school, and then
to DORTfllND whore he co;.plctod his schooling.
4.	In 1914 he vma sent to the College f «r Teachers at '..'OIJTSTEIN near POSER
with the intention of training as a teacher but was obli-od to break off
his studies at the outbreak of the Eirst World Tar when he returned to
DORT -HM) to find. OiiployiJont as o^tanercial apprentice at the Hansa
Kettenfabrik.
5.	In 191? he entered the employ of the iron-works in OLSRERG/Sauerland as
chief cashier but .noved back to DOETNUND a-sin in 1923 as business -wona-
ger to the enpineerinp fira of Luneiiiaiin at a salary of r>00 TCIls a .ont!i
aid re.^ained with that firm until 1932 whoa they went ’lanliruit and he
found himself out of work.
DDLITia i. IISTORY.
S.	Purin-- the sucooodiny two years of unenployri-:nt he joined the Party in
Nob 32, seeing therein th; only hope of a settled ee000.550 and politica.l
future, onl six ironths later entered the SS. He carried out the usu 1
duties such as acting as ’nody-gurird to speakers and preserving ord :r -at
Tarty e A3	* 1 .S »
7.	Re declares this to be the extent of his political activities.
f
'OTICE gSTTGE. _
8.	Soon after the Nazis had assumed authority a mailer of SS eon including
HSTT wore attached t ' the IKISdebM) police as auxiliaries. Then in Sc- :f
the saue y .nr fear of political disturbances had dispersed, and they could
’xj relieved of this duty. Nett was ordered ’y his S3 officer to -e.tteivd a
4 week course in Eripo work at 7SRI»UT at the conclusion of which he was
offered a oemnont -job In the Kripo on ur-eferential tor.s without serving
the usual period as a learner, die did HOT accept the offer because he
prefurod to return to his career as a *x>ok;-teeper.
9.	In AtH 34, six ;ionths later, however, he was still vi-thout a jo'- so he
c?as drafted without choice into the police fores by the SS.
10.	Traimnp. Durin" the first tan y ■ars of his service he si irlre-1 throu ii
all depart cuts of the 5ripo	by way of trainiii- before -wceivi-ir

NETT, points out that he had the same opportunity to avoid apprehension
by the Allies as the Cafflo staff in DACH/dJ who disappeared beforethe
orpiv’-l of th; Americans. He preferred to stay on however, irstly,
because he had no reason to fear either the Allies or the liderated ••s
prisoners, and secondly, because he relieved that the in1 or mtion he
could rive repardinr SS erieies would be of the yreP.tcst interest to
the Allies themselves.

As a result of his work in oorubattinp corruption he was reinsta-

Early 45. MORGEH was posted to GRAOCW and his place at the

your BACSR/37711/221/a(pS.4) of 10 Jan 46, enclosing Captain
i report, statement by the a/n accused and other depositions
(■ded by HQ, 1 Corps District,
e is no evidence that the polish employee at the BSiBERG-
silk factory whom the accused admits having struck when
caused of theft,ms,a forced worker. The only other evidence
is that of his divorced wife and her brother who allege
tter was sent to a labour camp for two years in consequence
tion by his brother*in-law (the accused) to the Gestapo for

Subject: RUEPERT, ,.iIheXi
1.	A petition for release from the wife of the above-named
has been received dated 30th September 1946.
2.	She states that her husband has been interned since
11th May 1946 for having ill-treated Poles. He is at present,
according to her letter, in hospital at a prison camp in
WOIEEKBDETTEL, Ziegenmarkt 10.
3.	This H.Q. has no trace of the above-named, and as his
arrest would appear- to have been solely on war criminal grounds,
it is thought that you may be able to furnish some information.
His address is - SALZCITTSS/H^R2? Engeroderstr 66.

October, 1946.
Ref. your letter BAOR/37711/221/a (PS4) dated 28th
August, 1946.
Herewith original and two copies of affidavit hy Mr.
BAXLEY taken as requested in question and answer form for
onward transmission to the U.S. authorities.﻿/
In the matter of War Crimes committed by German nationals,
and in the matter of the ill treatment of internees at Dachau Concentration
Camp, Germany, I, Kingston George Bailey, 2? years, residing at 24 Valley
Road, Barnoldswick. Make the following statement in response of an
interrogation by John Francis Sherwin, Police Inspector, of the West
Riding of Yorkshire Constabulary, on Tuesday, 24th September, 1946.
When were you captured ?	At the outbreak of the war, I was a Police
Constable in the Channel Isles Police, at Guernsey,
and resided at Belldrick, Lee Croutes, St. Peter
Port, Guernsey. In March, 1942, I was arrested by
the German Gestapo for breaking into a German Food
Store, at St. Peter Port, and was sentenced on false
evidence to Two Years and eight months imprisonment.
What Prison Camps were you at ? From March, 1942, for a period of a few weeks I ms
interned in prison in Guernsey, and on the 13th June,
1942, was taken to Caen Prison, France, on 15th July,
1942, to Villeneuve St. George Prison, Paris, France.
About the 15th April, 1943, I was taken to the Bernau
Labour Camp, Germany, and on the 19th January, 1944, I
was at Swabmunchan Camp. On the 22nd of November, 1944
I was at the Central Prison, Lansberg. From there I
ms taken to The Central Police Station, Munich, and
than to the Gestapo Prison at Munich. I was moved on
the 19th December, 1944, to the Dachau Concentration
Camp, Germany. On the 1st February, 1945, I was sent
to Munich and on the 3rd of February, 1945, sent to
the British Internment Camp at Laufen, and was
liberated by the Americans on the 6th of ! ay, 1945*
Did you see any incident of
ill treatment of any
prisoners, or any War Crimes
or atrocities at any of the
camps you were at ?
Do you know any of the names
of a .y of the perpetrators,
and their rank and unit ?
Do you know the names and
Units of any witnesses who
did witness any atrocity or
war crime ?
.,hat information did you get
respecting any war crime or
atrocity, or ill treatment
of prisoners ?
No, I did not actually witness any incident of
atrocity, or war crimes. I was only struck once, thu-t
was by the foreman of the cement factory at the
Svj&bmunchan Camp, but I did not know his name, he we.
a civilian guard in the factory where I was working.
There was the general starvation of prisoners at all
the camps I was at, but the worst was at the Dachau
Concentration Camp, Germany, men were dying at the
rates of about eighty a day, there were four or five
a day in ray room.
The chief of the factory and also the owner, at the
camp, at Swabraunchan was named Gerruder Kroon, and
the main "S.S.'” man at the Dachau Camp was culled
Ruppert, and there was a doctor there called Dr. Karl
Schilling. I never witnessed any ill treatment by
them and do not know what their rank was or their Uni .
Yes, there was a Pole named Richard C&sala, he we.s i j
interpreter at Dachau Camp, he could speak a number
of languages and had been there from 1940. I do not
know the names of others I had spoken to, but could
identify them.
When I was at the Villeneuve St George Prison, at
Paris, a lady and her daughter named, Hubert, who
lived at ?6 Rue Boursault, Paris, and another lady
named Doit, also of Paris, visited us with food and
clothing, also smuggled out lettersfor Guernsey. Hie;,
wore all arrested by the Gestapo, and interned, the
lady named Doit died in the Ravensbruk Concentration
Camp, the ot.ier two I saw alive in Guernsey, in
August, 1946, what really happened to Madam Doit. Tna
interpreter Casala told me that the Or. Karl Schillitv
was asking for volunteers to work in the hospital at
Dachau, offering them more food, when they went into
the hospital he experimented on them. We never saw
any of the porsons who volunteered again. He also
told me of the burning of ninety Russian Officers, also
that a young Polish boy of 19 years of age, whom they
had hung, he was supposed to be mental. I was also﻿told that a young Czech prisoner ms shot in the back at
a distance of about 100 yards for trying to escape.
I personally witnessed ill treatment of 76 prisoners
when we were moved from the Gestapo Prison at Munich to
the Dachau Camp, on the 18th December, 1944, there were
76 of us packed into a lorry twelve feet square, the
guard stood on the back of the lorry and struck with
the butt end of his revolver and kicked us to get us all in
th© lorry.
There was a man named Grandjean from Paris, he had been
beaten with iron bars at th© Moeac Concentration Camp, he died
at the Dachau Camp the same day as he arrived. There was also
an dnglish man named Ashcroft from Guernsey who was at the
Bernau. Labour Camp, he was beaten up by one of the official
guards named Her Plata, also by the Officer in charge of the
hounds at 11113 camp, 1 do not know where Ashcroft is now. The
interpreter Casala told me about these atrocities and the
beating up of prisoners. There was another English man, I
did not km-w his name, he was given a job in the cookhouse
at Dachau Camp, and he was caught with a notebook, Gasala was
called to translate what was in the book but he could not as
it was in shorthand, the Englishmen was starved in a cell until
he stated what was in the book, he was taken away to go to
Buchanviald Concentration Gamp, but he never got there.
I could identify the guards who manned the machine gun posts
at the camps, also the guards at the food and clothing stores
there. I could also identify the BS.S."' officer who spoke to
me at Dachau Camp, when I was taken to the British Internment
Camp at Laufen. He told me that if I spoke or said anything
of what I had seen at the Dachau Camp I should be brought back
and shot.
What is your permanent My permanent address is 24 Valley Road, Barnoldswick, and
address now, and what when I was arrested I resided at Belldrlck, Los Croutes,
was it when you were St. Peter Port, Guernsey,
arrested by the
Germans ?﻿ubj.jot5-	; uint,8rro,jyiirr pijs;itmp.• ,wb

5.	Einzelheiten zu 3. u.4.
zu 4.) Wahrend der Zeit vom Juni 43 - April 1944 war Th „ipl
den versch&iedenen SS-l-Einheiten als Ausbilder tatig.
Aufgrund meines schweren Herzfehlers konnte ich zu keiner
Bronttruppe versetzt werden. Die genaue Bezeichnung der
SS-T-Truppenteile ist mir nicht mehr bekannt.
Tatigkeit in DACHAU:
Da ich fur einen Bronteinsatz nicht infrage kam, wurde ich
im April 1944 zum SS-T-Wach-Btl.Dachau als Wachmann versetzt,
In den ersten fagen vrarde ich als Posten am Haupteingang des
lagers eingesetzt. Each etwa einem Monat wurde ich Y/achmann
und hatte etwa 15 Haftlinge morgens und abends ven zur Ar-
beit und ins Lager zu fuhren. Die Haftlinge waren in einer
Holzwarenfabrik beschaftigt. Wahrend der ganzen Zeit sind
keiH keine Bluchtversuche in meinem Kommando vorgekommen. Ich hal
die Haftlinge immer gut und menschlich behandelt und hatte
stets ein gutes Verhaltnis zu ihnen.
tJber die Vorgange im Lager war ich nicht unterrichtet. da
ich wahrend der Zeit in Dachau nur 2-mal das Lager betreten
habe, wegen einer Rucksprache mit dem Adjutanten betr. Urladrj
Mit den Wachleuten des Lagers kamen v/ir nicht in Beruhrung,
da fur das Lager ein besonderes Wach-Btl. bestand.
- 2 -﻿2
Am 9.5.45 wurde ich durch die Amerikaner gegfangengesetzt.
Von diesem Tage bis zum 16.1.1947 war ich Lager DACHAU als
Eriegsgefangener. Am 16.1.47 fluchtete ich aus dem Lager, um
in die russ.Zone zu meinem Onkel nach Brandenburg zu gelan-
gen. Auf dem Bahnhof in Gottingen wurde ich durch die deut-
sche Polizei verhaftet.

(3STER1VEQ-BM No. 360963)
To:	HQ Int.Div. 70 HQ. CCG (BE)
B. A. 0. R.
1.	The ^ person was arrested by 2 Cdn FSS in Feb. 46 and sent to
SSTSRteSN internment ca:np. The reason for arrest, stated on the Arrest
Report, was given as "G-uard at DACHAU Concentration Camp and suspected member
of S3 Totemkopf verb&nde".
2.	There have been several petitions for his release from relatives and
also the Oberkreisdirektor, which were forwarded at the time to the camp. The
Canadians, before leaving, left a recommendation for his release, and local
apinion in CLOFPENBURG-, where he lives, is in his favour, as he was called up
to the S3 at the last moment and only served for a short time at DACHAU as guard
and dispatch-rider.
A letter written by this office in Aug. 46 to the Commandant of SSTERYSGEN
was replied to as follows:-
"No written authority for his release has been received here."
3.	His history in brief is as follows: -
Born 15 Aug 24.
Secondary schooling
Considered Nazism as violation of his personal freedom.
Joined Jungvolk and later HITLER YOUTH.
Was punished for not doing his duties properly.
Believed to have sabotaged a meeting of the HJ.
1943	Was called up for Luftwaffe.
1944	Was forced to join the Waffen S3 and was posted to DACHAU Concen. camp
as guard and courier.
1945	On courier service at the ELBE reported to another Unit stating that
his own had been wiped out.
Was employed as wireless operator.
1945	Taken prisoner in April by British Forces.
Released from P. 0. W. Camp in July.
1946	Arrested in February and lodged in 101 Civil Int. Camp.
4. It was understood in Aug.' 46 from P. 3. that he would be released to
CLOPPENBURGr, but he is still at ESTERWEGEN. Could this matter please be enquired
into, and if his release is not to take place, could the reason for his continued
detention be communicated to us.

X--- born 18.3.19o8

f %
I am being tinted as a war criminal though I am not such one.
1)	Being arrested by French Mission at Hilden on 16th Nov. 1945 I was
told at xny hearing that my brother-inlaw Anton Hawetzda at Wuppertal
Langenfeld had denounced me because I had brought him into a
concentration camp. Really H. never has been in a c.c., nor he had
been denounced by me. The truth is that^ he has been sentenced by
the Court (landge. icht) at. Hagen to one year imprisonment in 1943
because of "black-Butchering” (Schwarzschlachtung) and corruption-
actions, this pursuant to a denunciation by Mrs. Heinzmann at
Schwelm whose husband was an accomplice^and had often beaten her.
Mrs. H.this declared under oath and can^ead- in the trial-report
in a newspaper being at my mother luise Beckmann at Wuppertal-
langenfeld, Kattendick I.
In.HiidenI was told at length that the case of my brother-
^ in-rlaw is settled.
2)	At the same time I was told at Hilden that I had to be brought
into 4th C.I.C. because of an incident with a Polish woman wich.
I myself had noticed. This matter is ajfollowi--
During my occupation at the firm of "I.P.Bemberg ltd" at	,
Wuppertal in d944 (supervising German workers, among them several
Polish Woman) a Polish female worker told me one day that another
Polish woman had stolen her wool. After having stated this as the
truth I said to the thief to give back the wool and hereby gripped
at her ear. There were no ill-treatments by me!
These facts I myself declared to the minutes at Hilden. There
had been ma denunciation against me.
3)	During my detention at Hilden my dwrelling was ransacked by the
interpreter Hern (German) from the French Mission and by a man
from the Antifa. Hereby they stole from me: EM 30.000 cash (I am
a cattle-dealer by profession), a golden wrist-watch, a golden
seal-ring and an auto-car (D.K.W,).
On 15.3.1947 I wa-s interrogated in 4th CIO by two French
criminal-police officials telling me the interpreter Kern and the
French capitain Ordlick to be criminals and to sit aider lock and
key.
Therefore I must suppose that I have been brought into 4th GIG.
by Kern in order to be made undeleterious in view of this theft,
4)	I do not belong, too, to the prosecuted members of the criminal
organisations. I never was a member of the H8DAP but I belonged
to the DAJ? and Reiohskolonialbund without any office. On 15.7.1942:
l was called up to the Waffen-SS.
15.7.42	till 31.lo.42 = Pioneer-Training-Division at Dresden,
1.11.42	till 14.3.43 = as a disabled pioneer tra^ferred to
Kraftfahrersatzabtoilung at Berlin-
liehterfelde,
15.3.43 till Oct. 1943 = hospital Be:: lin-Zehlendorf because of
articular rheumatism.
Oct. 43 till Dec. 43 = detailed to medical review-office at
»	Dachau for the purpose of reviewing my
fitness for military service. Result:"
unfit for military service- discharged.

﻿Translation
I.cii werde als Eriegsverbrecher beliandelt, obwohl ich keiner bin,
1,) Am 16,11,45 durch die Franzdsiscite Mission in Hidden verhaftet,
words mir bei melner Vernehm’ong erdffnet, mein Schwager Anton
Hawetzda in Wuppertal-Langenfeld habe mich denunziert, we.il
ich ihn ins K.Z. gebracht habe. In Wirklichkeit ist H. nie
im KZ. gev/esen, von mir auch nicht angezeigt worden. Tielmehr
words' er 1943 vom Landgericht Hagen wegen S.chwarzschl^chtung
und Schiebongen zu einem dahr G-efsngnis verurtei.lt, und zwar
auf Grand' einer Anzeige einer Frau Heinzemnn in Schwelm, deren
Ehemann mitbeteiligt war and sie in bet unkenem Zustande haafig
geschlagen hatte, Dies hat Frau H. im Prozess gegenkeinen Schwa-
geifonter Bid ausgesagt und kann ausserdem im Prozes'sbericht in
einer Zeitung nachgelesen warden, die sich bei meiner Matter
Witwe-Luise Beckmann, Wuppertal-iangenfeld, Kattendick I, be-
■ findst.
In Hidden ’wurde mir schriesslich erklart, dass die Ange-
legenheit mit meinem Schwager erledigt •eei.
2.	) Gleichzeitig warde mir in Hilden gesagt, ich musse ins 4. Camp
gebracht warden wegen eines von mir selbst angegebenen VorfaLIs
mit einer Polin, Hie.mit verhalt es sich folgendermassen:
, Wahrend m'einer Beschaftigang bei -der Fa. J.P. Bemberg in
Wuppertal im Jahre 1944 (als Aufseher liber Arbeiter in einem
ArbeitssaalJ, darunter eihige Polinnen) sagte mir eines Pages sine
polnisehe Arbeiterin, dass eine andere Polin ihr Wolle gestohlen
habe. Hachdem ich die Richkigkeit dieser Beh uptiyig festgest .lit
hatte, forderte ich die Diebin auf, die Welle an ilire Kameradin
zuriickzugeben und fasste sie hierbei ans Ohr. Ke.inerlei Miss-
hanilungen durch mich!
Die sen Sachverhalt habe ich in Hilden von mir aus zu Protokolll
gegeben. Is lag keinerlei Denunziation gegen mich vor.
Auch hiernach bin ich kein Kriegsverbrecher.
3.	) Wahrend meiner Haft in Hilden wurde meine Wohnung von dem bei
der Franzosischen Mis.ion tatigen Dolmetseher Kern (Deutscher)
und einem Mann von der Antifa durchsueht, Hierbei stahlen sie
mir 30.000 RM Bargeld, (ich bin von Beruf Tiehhandler), eine
goldene Armbandulir, einen goldenen Siegelring und 1 Personen- j
auto (DEW.)
Am 15.3*47 wurde' ich im 4. Camp von zwei franzosischen
Kriniinalbeamten vernommen, die mir sagten, dass der Dolmetschor
Kern und der franzosische,Capitain Ordlik Yerbrecher seien und hin-
ter Sphloss und Riegel sassen.
Hiernach muss ich annehmen, dass ich wegen der harmlosen
Polenangelegenheit auf Verahlassung von-Kern ins 4, Camp ge-
bracht wurde, um im Hinblick aUf seinen Dlebstahl mundtot ge-
macht zu werden.
4.	) Ich gehbre auch nicht zu den verfolgbaren Angehdrigeri einer
verbrecherischen Organisation. War nie Mitglied der STSDAP. wohl
aber der DAF und des ReichskOlonialbundes (ohne jedes Amt). Am
15.7.42 wurde ich zur Waffeh-BS einberufen.

Recklinghausen, 16 March 19U7
TO: the State Commissioner for Victims of Fascism,
Dr. Philipp AUERBACH, Munich.
Re: Information concerning the former SS-man at KZ DACHAU, named Wilhelm
BUECKING, born in Recklinghausen.
SS-man BUECKIFG served as guard at DACHAU from 1937-hO. Now
he is still a prisoner of war. His address: Uffz. Wilhelm BUECKING, Gef. Ho.
A 738830, Lager Ho. 2227 E, B.A.O.R. via Hannover. His present attitude is no
different than it was before. From the fall of 19U2 until the end of 19U3 he
was on "work leave" as a miner in the Friedrich der Grosse mine at Herne. While
there he so maltreated several captive Russians that one of them had to be
brought into a hospital. BUECKING also boasted to me that he and a fdw of his
comrades had fought their wa out of a Russian trap by stabbing II4 Russians
in the back with bayonets. He admitted, however, that they could have escaped
from the trap without killing these men, but reasons were that the killed
Russians were no longer able to fire on German soldiers. To proof his deed he
showed me a blood-stained bayonet. I should like to ask that, if possible,
I could be informed of any misdeeds of his in the DACH® KZ.

Several months ago Theodor Friemuth was arresteted by police and is
living now in the Camp of Hamburg-Fischbeck. He is accused to have
been a member of SS-Formation. That is true to have been such a member
But following facts are considered: In political causes he never had
taken part of. He was estimated an honorable man and 1933 he had
built without any compensation the we&L knowned St.- Mary-Chapel at
Ahden i. Westf.
We need him very urgently for the readification of our Seminary of
Archbishop of Faderborn, where he had worked just he was taken. We
request therefore to discharge him.

Ber vor einigen Vvochen verhaftete Theodor Friemuth befindet sich
•im obig bezeichneten Lager. Der Grund seiner Verhaftung war wohl der,
dass er frtlher einer SS-Formation angehbrt hat. Das ist in der Tat so.
Doch ist zu bedanken, dass Friemuth sich niemals politisch bethtigt
hat und bei aaray seinen Mitbtlrgern als reehtlich denkender Mensch gilt.
Auch zur Terrorzeit der Nazismus hat er aus seiner kirchlichen Ueber-
zeugung nie Hehl gemacht, hat soger 1933 eine St. Marien-Kapelle in
Ahden fast unentgeldlich gebaut.
Zur Zeit seiner Verheftung war er bei uns mir dem liederaufbau
unseres Erzbischbflichen Friesterseminajfrs beschfiftigt. Zum Fortgang
der Arbeiten bedtirfen wir seiner dringend und wir ersuchen hOflichst,
ihn freizugeben.	'...﻿txecutive Trial & Extradition Section

INFORMATION BULLETIN NO. U8
6 August Ipl;?
Dbchau, 5 August---High Naziz protected their personal graft and
fraud by having "undesirable persons" and witnesses "removed/1 Prince
zu ;aldeck testified today in a U.S. war crime court sitting in the
Buchenwald concentration camp trial.
On the stand in his own behalf, .the former SS general and higher
S3 and police leader denied knowledge of much of the brutality testifi-
ed to in the trial, and declared "hundreds" of court cases were started
against SS men under his jurisdiction when he learned they mistreated
prisoners at Buchenwald.
Under persistent cross-examination by chief prosecutor Nilliam D.
Denson of Birmingham, Ala., he named only one specific case. He said his.
memory had failed.
Tfaldeck said he was ordered by Himmler, himself, to release the for-
mer Buchenwald commander, Koch whom the Prince had arrested for "corruption,"
Koch later -was tried and executed. He mentioned several officials close
to Himmler who had "as many as seven or eight undesirable persons removed"
to protect themselves.
He said the order for the notorious evacuation of Buchenwald came
from Himmler personally, but denied seeing any beatings of prisoners as
they were being marched from the camp.
The four-nonth-rold trial of 31 officials and guards of Buchenwald,
where thousands allegedly died from "medical experiments," executions and
deliberate brutality, is expected to end this week.
Dachau 5 August---Nine former S3 officials from the notorious
Mauthausen concentration camp and its chain of by-camps were given
sentences totaling 10l| years, the highest being 20 years, by a U.S.
war crimes court here today.
They were found guilty of overt acts consisting of beatings, tor-
tures, brutality, general mistreatment and killing of prisoners. Tito
other defendants were a^gaittod.

In the name and with the power of attorney of the a/n who
appointed me his defender' I beg to submit the following application
1.
My mandator has been arrested by British Military Police
at NSHUM-HDESTEN , his then residence, on 1 Apr 46, and removed
to an internment camp nr EECEHNSHAUSffl, on 9" Apr 46 where he
stayed dntil 1 Jun 47 and then has been removed to the camp
"PANZBHKASEHN'E" at HAMBDE&-PISCHBEdT, No. 2, War Criminals Hold-
ing Centre”. In spite of repeated requests my mandator has not yet
been informed of the reason of his arrest and of his charge.
Hitherto he has only twice been interrogated, and in both cases
on-ly statements on his person have been taken, i.e. in April 1946
at EECKLINGHAUSEN and on 17 Apr 47 at HAMBHEGr-PIS CHBECk. At the
first interrogation he was told in answer to his question that
he was searched for by the imerlcan Military Police and was there-
for to be removed to the .American Zone.
2.
Apart from having joined the NSDAP already on 1 Apr 32 and
having held the honorary post of "Ereiskassenrevisor" (auditor) at
MARIMBURGr/WESTPBEUSSM for a short time, i.e. until 1935 only,
he is unblemished with regard to his political background and in
any other respect, too. On 1 Nov 24, he joined the ranks of the
then "KEICHSWEKE" in order to take the paymasters’ career. After
the usual training.he served as a soldier for 3 years, i.e. until
1927, and then after a 3 years' training as administrative official
of the Army, he was nominated "ausserplanmassiger Qberverwaltungs-
sekretar" (Assistant Secretary of the Administration), in 1930,and.
"Stabszahlmeister" (Paymaster), on 1 Apr 37. Since 1944, when the
names of the.ranks were altered, he had the rank of "Stabsintendant".
As a simple collaborator of the "Divisionsintendant" (Chief of Ad-
ministration) of 246 Inf. Div. he took part in the, campaigns against
Poland and Prance, from 1 Jan 42 until 1 Jun 42, also against Eussia.
Prom 1 Jun 42 until 31 Mar 43, he was employed with the General
Headquarters‘in VIENNA and from 1 Apr 43 until the end of the war, he
was attached to the Army Group E in SADONHII in the same capacity
reap, as "Stabsintendant". He has never taken active part in any
fights or measures taken against the civil populationnf-the occupied
territories. At the end of the wax he wfc^t&k£n«$&igaiMt|b : or a short

mandator has in no way committed any punishable acts, arfS- above
all did not offend against the laws of the Allied Nations. ( ;
fherefor an alleged offence or crime of this kind cannot be
the reason of his arrest.
3. ...... ...	.-
Nor want of any other reasons of his arrest my mandator supposes
his arrest to be due to an act'of vengeance from the part of his
divorced wife. As a matter of fact, when finding his wife and his
daughter Ingrid, born 15/5/38 in TIMKA who had been compelled to
leave TIMKA and the former residence of my mandator, in spring 1945 -
at SCHKAIISSl, Bezirksamt ISAUKSIEIK (Bavaria), on his return from
captivity in the beginning of July 1945, he found that his wife
Margarethe KOBE ADI1, nee UEEIIH, born 21/6/17 at BIfZINGM near LBOH-
BEEG' (t'AJEK'IflAtBEKGr) had in the meantime begun an adulterous inter-
course with the Tieruaese merchant or engineer Willi PHI1LIPPM with
whom she was living. As all attempts made by my mandator - especially
with regard to the child of his marriage with the a/n - to induce his
wife to give up these adulterous relations were in vain, he brought
an action for divorce at liEBGfEEI(HT AMSBERG/WSSIPHAIIA against Tils
wife now still living with the a/h PHILIPPM at 3MJKIKCHM nr BAD
MERGrM'fHBIM, for adultery with the a/n PEIHIPPM. By a legal sentence
of LANDGEBJ CHI ABNSBER& dated 23 Jul 46 my mandator and his wife
have been divorced in, view of the adultery of my mandator's wife
with the a/n PHIIAIPPEK, and the wife was pronounced to be the only
one guilty.	, „........_	.
ETIPM QENile concerning the divorce of KGREADT against KOKKADI
' • Nile Eo. 3 R 105/46 of IAKDG-SKICHI iliESBEEG/WESTPHAUA.
At the end of March 1946, i.e. after having brought the action for
divorce, my mandator called on his then wife at NEUNKIRCEM nr BAD
MEHG-M'fHEIM in order to collect part of his suits, under?/ear etc. she h
had brought with her from TIMKA and partly allowed to. be worn by
the a/n PHILLIPPEN, as he himself Urgently wanted these things.
As he did,not meet bis wife at home, he took a leather trunk with
contents belonging to him as well as several pieces of clothing etc.
he had formerly-given to his wife for a present (among other things
a fur-collar (grey fox) with him. According to para 530,1 of the
German Civil Code my mandator was entitled to do so, because his
wife was guilty of severe ingratitude in view of her adultery with
the a/n PHILLIPPM. A short time before his departure from KEUlteiRCHM,
on occasion of which he took the trunk containing his own clothes etc.
and the a/m. things which had formerly belonged to his wife, with him,
he was informed that he was searched for by imeriean Military Police,
apparently on the strength of an information given by his wife.
Nor this reason he reported to the British Military Police after
hi's retuen to NMBIM-HUSSfM and was told that they were not interested
in him; but a few days later, he wsstorested, on 1 Apr 46, with the
argument that he was searched for.by the American Military Police.
My mandator has not been informed of the tenor of the records
concerning his divorce-case, as far as they are originating after
the date of his arrest; he has only been notified of the favourable
result of the divorce-case by his sister, Mrs. Gertrud StHNUk, nee
KORKADI, residence 6., VUE IK SEE ERS PR AS SB, SPRIE GE/DEI SfBR.
l£__﻿^ ■	In view of the supposition uttered tiy my mandator on occasion
of' our first conference, on 1 Aug 47, that his arrest is due to
an act of vengeance by his .divorced wife whom he supposes to have
given the information, I perused the file concerning the divorce-
case and found in two letters dated 5 Apr 46 and 25 Apr 46, written
by the then lawyer of my mandator's wife who advocated her in the
trial, Solicitor WOMlkD, residence ASHSBUEG/fESHJf’HALIA, stating
the divorced wife of my mandator has, indeed, given information
against him to the American Military Police at MEUKKIECHEH nr
BAD MEKGENPHSIM and to the British Military Police at HBHDIM-HUBSTM
for burglary, especially for' the theft of a trunk containing the
suits etc. of my mandator and some other things formerly belonging
to her. Probably my mandator's supposition that his divorced wife
has thrown suspicion on him with regard to his political background
out of vengeance is also true. In the first letter dated 5 Apr 4ft
I found the wording: the wife of my mandator had been informed of
bis arrest "on account of his political background."
In the name of my mandator who has been in custody now for
more than 16 months - and guiltless, I am sure - without having
been informed of his charge, I ask you to re-consider his case
without delay and to release my mandator as soon as possible or
at least accelerate the procedure against .him. So it should be
done for Justice's sake.
By the way,l beg to point out that a theft committed by a
husband to his wife's loss and vice versa is not punishable
according to para 247,2 of the German Penal Code. Bven if my
mandator committed a theft in March 1946 to the loss of his
wife who had at the time not yet been divorced, he could not be
punished on account of this action. Besides such an offence, i.e.
the alleged removal of household articles etc. - para 170 a of
the German Penal Code - is to be dealt with by German Oourts and.

I beg to enblose herewith a proces-verbal of examination
of the a/n, domiciled at SEVERN, Grunerweg 229 (British Zone).
This individual is said to have escaped from the internment
camp at ESTERWEGEN on 20 December 1946 and it is thought that he
is of interest to the Jjritish Authorities.

Interrogation of the German national
KOHLENBERG Heinz

Born:	24 June 1924
Place of birth: SEVERN
Son of Hermann KOHLEliBEEG and of Lina GQERING
Occupation Laboratory assistant (medical)
Last residence: SEVERN, Grunerweg 229
Embodied into the German army ,o£ 6 July 1941 and posted to the
SS Unit Anti-aircraft Battalion Koniuando Osl, Reichfuehrer S3 at WEIMAR-
BUCHENWALD where he remained up to the end of the year 1941.
'	C -J- ".1	©iA.X'I'. ’X-GW
Moved with his entire unit to UMiA Westphalia where he remained
up to February 1942.
Directed with his unit to the Eastern front (SOBROISK) where
he remained up to March 1942. After discharge from hospital he was separated
from the Army at MITTWEIDA (Saxony). From there he proceeded to SEVERN near
HOLZMINDEN on the Weser.
He was sent to hospital again at MEULLEN on the Elbe on the
grounds of tuberculosis. He remained with this establishment from July 1944-
up to the end of that year. He was again moved to SEVERN for his discharge.
He remained ’with his mother at SEVERN Grunerweg 229 up to his arrest by the
British police. He was kept in the internment camp WESTERIPINKE. He remained
in this camp up to 4he end of 1945. His number was 356477. He was moved to the
33 internment camp SANDBOSTEL and in March 1946 to the internment camp
ESTER1EGEN. He escaped from this oaup on 20 December 1946 and moved to
ASCHERSLEBEN where he remained up to Easter 1947? at Magdeburger Ghaussee No. 19.
He then proceeded to DUESSELDORF where he called on the French Liaison officer
in order to enrol in the Legion. On 25 April he proceeded to ¥ILLINGEN and froir
? there to KSHL to the Depot of i^iaBje^iop, where he underwent his medical
examination. Nobody noticed the' XaWcxwg of his blood group.
About 3 or 4 May he was sent with a convoy of approximately 150
Germans to MARSEILLE. He was found to be unfit. He proceeded to MIRAMAS where
he was arrested by the French railway police. He was sent back to the Depot on
15 Pay 1947.
He is in possession of several photographs of which two show a
woman wearing the uniform of the British arty. This woman is supposed to have
worked at the UNERA at EOHX THIEDE via BRUNSWICK, Wolfenbuttlerstrasse and
where he is supposed to have found shelter whilst he escaped. Her name is
KUEHNE, Irngard.
Another photograph shows an address written in pencil, FRANKFURT
Rheinstrasse 12, (lodging house and bakers). An individual Anton STOBERMANN
lived there where one could procure false documents for himself.
Has blotted out his tatooing coinciding with the entry of the
Allied troops in Germany and shows a circular mark approximately 6 to 4 cms.
caused by acid burn.
Owing to his escape from an internment camp in the British ^
I have contacted the British RAF police which has made the necessary-
in order to check up on the truth of this German's statement and eve
should be handed over to the British authorities.
