HQ USFET.﻿Dear
Reference your R/0.222 dated 5th June 1946.
X apologise for the delay which has occurred in
answering your letter but it only arrived nere on the 22 June.
The subject mentioned in your letter, whose
correct name is Walter OTTO (OTTO being the surname) was one
of the defendants at the BELsEN Trial wiao was acquitted. It is
impossible to say in a war crimes trial where only the finding
and sentence is announced, why any of the defendants have been
acquitted and the only answer I would suggest tnat we can supply
to the Belgian Commissioner is that it would appear that the
prosecution were not able to prove their case against this
subject.
Having taken part in the prosecution of the main
accused at the BELSE1T Trial, I would like to say, off the record,
that the case against Walter OTTO was one of the ten cases
which were originally thought to be very weak and most of the
evidence against him consisted of affidavits as the witnesses
who had given evidence against him could not be produced in
person, and, as you know, British Courts are always extremely
reluctant to convict anybody on mere affidavit evidence.
Yours

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA.
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send " Enclosure B.Ms.'' simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(b)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic " records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c)	COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unhkely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(а)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(б)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

Please refer to the minutes of the meeting held on
the 2nd August under the chairmanship of the D.A. G. (A) at
Hohart House and to our subsequent telephone conversation
about the United Nations War Crimes Commission's attitude
to the Belsen trial.
I write to confirm that I spoke to Lord Wright,
chairman of the U.N.W.C.C. on the 7th August. His reaction
was, as I thought, that it was most desirable that the
Belsen trial should be got going as soon as possible and
that in the case of the trials of the guards of concentration
camps (as opposed to the trials of Germans accused of
specific crimes against British subjects or non-British
subjects) there was no point in trying to submit the case
in a round-about way through the British national office.
To safeguard the position of the U.N.W.C.C., however, he
said he would like in such cases to have a list of the accused
direct fbom the military authorities together with a
short account of the charges. The Commission would then act
m this evidence and list the accused as War Criminals
charged by the Commission and not by any specific national
>ffice.
v	In the Belsen case his actions have already been as
good as his word. He sent the Commission's research
officer to the Judge Advocate General's Department on the
evening of the 7th August (the day on which I saw him) and
received the list of the accused from them the following
morning. All forty-siJi persons on the list were then held

7.	With regard to the evidence
(i) Affidavits or statements have been taken from the necessary witnesses
and 60 copies of each are enclosed herewith. Hi© original affidavits
and statements together with 3 copies thereof have been forwarded to the
Deputy Judge Advocate General at your Headquarters.
(ii) With regard to the attendance of witnesses at the trial; the rules of
evidence under English law as .modified by regulation 8 of the ‘Regulations
for the Irial of ar Criminals' apply to the trial of war- criminals before
military courts. Consequently in a ease lirer® regulation 8(1) (a) applies
to a witness an affidavit or other signed statement from the witness may
be put in in evidence. It is understood that the majority of the witnesses
in this ease may not now be available to give evidence in person. As many
witnesses as possible who are now readily available should be called to
give evidence to the effect of th©ir affidavit or statement.
(Hi) 7ou will observe that a copy of the joint affidavit of Serjeants Lawrie,
Lewis and Ileywoodj all l.A.O.C.f is included witty th® e«?py affidavits or
statements enclosed herewith and that this copy affidavit refers to a
photographic film of scenes taken at Bergen-Belsen Concentration Carap. I
think this film should be exhibited at the trial, use being made of the
affidavit of Serjeants Laurie, Lewis am Haywood, none of whom will I
understand be available to attend the trial. Hie film is forwarded
herewith.
(iv) Captain Stewart, J.A.G. Branch at your Headquarters, should be called as a
witness at the trial to state that he received the copy Register of Deaths
referred to in paragraph 3 above and that he has made analyses of the
nationality of the deceased and of the causes of death referred to in such
Register; he must state the nationalities and causes of death contained in
such analyses. A copy of the evidence to be given by Captain Stewart
should be given to each of the accused.
8.	In ray opinion the court should be presided over by a Major General and
four other senior officers as mesabers. In my view also, ary of the Allied Nations
whose nationals are involved should be invited to send representatives as observers
at the trial.
9*	Hie Judge Advocate General further directs me to say that, in accordance
with the second paragraph of paragraph 5 of 'Regulations for the Trial of War
Criminals', he has deputed Mr. C.L. Stirling, C.B. b, Deputy Judge Advocate General
of th® Forces, to be judge advocate at tin© trial.
I will make th® necessary arrangements for his journey to attend th© trial
if you will let me know the date and place of trial.
10.	In my view the prosecution should b@ conducted by an officer who is
experienced in prosecuting cases before military courts. No doubt you will consult
with l.J.A.G. at your Headquarters on this matter.
11.	No doubt you will consider that the services of a British officer or
officers should be offered to the accused (see regulation 7 of 'Regulations for the
Trial of War Criminals').
12.	I think each of the accused should be supplied with a copy of the affidavits
and statements and arrangements should be made for th® services of an interpreter to
be available to th® accused if they so require.
/13﻿-4-

1J. One copy of the charge sheet will be required for the use of the judge
advocate and one copy for the use of the prosecuting officer.
14.	This office will arran^o for the necessary shorthand writers.
15.	The services of an iaapartial person competent to act as interpreter at the
trial should be available. Provision will also have to be made for mg Allied
nationalsuho may be called to J.ve oral evidence and who are unable to speak the
German language.

1.	I have received a copy of the rtotes on the interrogation of
the accused Joseph HAMER by Goramandant Raymond Jadin of the
Tribunal tilitaire, 'Strasbourg. I think that if Commandant Jadin
is readily available he should be called as a witness at the trial
to state tho circurastanfios in which he interrogated the accused
KRAMi® and to state as exactly as possible anything said by KRMER
on that oocasion. If a note ms made at the time of the inter-

not© to refresh his maaory.
2.	If Gomandant Jadin will not be available to attend the
trial in person, an affidavit or statement should be taken from him
and should include thexevidence referred to above. I think that
each of the accused should be informed of the evidence to be given
by Comaandsnt Jadin and if an affidavit or statement is taken from
him2 each of the accused should be supplied with a copy thereof.﻿3. Reference paragraph 7(iv) of this office minute referred

T/AR GRI&ES
Cadet Officer OKSAI
aM Ser jemt KISS v
of the Hungarian Forces.
I am instructed by the Judge Advocate General of the Forces to return
this case which was referred tore by the D.J.A.G. at your Headquarters.
1.	The Judge Advocate General has instructed me to convey to you the
following advice with regard to the case :
2.	As no British Nationals are involved in this case it has not been
submitted to the British National Office. It Is not at present clear that
the internees referred to in the charges were in fact Allied Nationals
although this may well be so. It is essential to prove at the trial that
some at least of them were Allied Nationals (otherwise no War Or line has been
committed) and a witness or witnesses must be called to give evidence to
this effect.
3. Subject to paragraph 2 above in my opinion the evidence Justifies the
trial by Military Court under the Royal Warrant of the above-named Cadet
Officer OKSAY can the following charge : -
COMMITTING A WAR CHIMB
Charge:
in that he
at Bel sen in Germany on or about 29 April 1945 in violation of the laws and .
usages of war did shoot at a number of unarmed civilian internees. Allied
Nationals.
4. I am further of opinion that Serjeant KISS should be tried upon the
following charge
Committing a war crbe:
Charge:
in that he
at Belsen in Germany on or about 13 April 1945 iu violation of the laws and
usages of war did shoot at a number of unarmed civilian interneessAllied
Nationals, wounding cm thereof.
5.	In each case the accused should be attached to a unit and the
Commanding Officer should sign the Charge Sheet as such in accordance with
paragraph 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals as set out
in Army Order 81 of 1945•
«*
6.	In the heading of the Charge Sheet in each case the accused should be
described as "of the Hungarian Aragt In charge of....(unit)..." pursuant to
/Regulation h-..,﻿- 2 - / ,
Regnlaticsi 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals.
7.	With regard to the evidence in the case of Cadet Officer OKSAY the
following witnesses should be called to give evidence
(i) Gulyas Pal, who should give evidence in accordance with his affidavit
omitting the fact that the Hungarian soldier who was
wounded later died of typhus;
(ii) Major Laszlo, who should give evidence in accordance with his
affidavit omitting the fact that the Hungarian soldier
who was wounded later died of typhus.
8.	With regard to the evidence in the case of Serjeant KISS the following wit-
nesses should be called to give evidence at the trial :-
(i) Oren Ferenc, who should give evidence in accordance with his affidavit;
(ii) Juhasz Laszlo,who should give evidence in accordance with his affidavit.
9.	The Judge Advocate General has further instructed me to say that he does not
consider these are cases in which he should depute a judge advocate to.advise the
court. Nor does he consider that a judge advocate is necessary. In these circum-
stances one of the members of the court should have legal qualifications in accord-
ance with Rule of Procedure 93(B). You will doubtless make application to & J.A.G.
at your Headquarters for the appointment of such an officer. Similarly, it is con-
sidered that the prosecution should be conducted by an officer with legal qualifica-
tions, and application should be made to D.J.A.G. for the appointment of such an
officer.
10.	In each case, in my opinion, all witnesses should give evidence orally at
the trial, but if any of the witnesses are not available the affidavits made by
them caii be jiut in by the prosecution.
11.	In my opinion these accused should be offered the services of an officer
with legal qualifications to defend them at their trials. I think that the	_
accused should be supplied with a copy of the affidavits referred to in paragraphs
7 and 8 above. At the same time they should be offered the services of an
interpreter if they so desire. One copy of the charge sheet and abstract of
evidence in each case will be required for the use of the prosecutor.
12.	I enclose the original affidavits of the witnesses referred to above.
13.	An impartial person competent to act as interpreter in the Hungarian
language should be available at the trial of Cadet Officer Oksay and impartial
persons competent to act as interpreters in the Hungarian and the Roumanian
languages should be available at the trial of Serjeant Kiss.

' ear Mr. Brolaaann,
e have been asked by the 1 ar Office to invite
the Committee for Jews in Germany to nominate one
observer to attend the trial of the Camp Staff of
Bergen Belsen concentration camp which is to begin
at the Town Gymnasium at Luneburg on the 17th
September before a >pecial British military Court.
I regret that notice is so short but it is
hoped that it is sufficient for you to select an
observer for this important trial.
I am told that the military authorities in the
British rmy of the Rhine will provide accommodation
and messing for observers in the Cavalry Barracks at
Luneburg.
In order to save time I suggest that you send
your reply to this letter to AG3(V/W)» the ^ ar
0 ice, 20 aton 3quare» S.' .1. (for attention of
Colonel Bradshaw), informing him of the name of the
observer you select and details as to when he would
be able to reach Luneburg. In the event of your
observer going from London, Colonel Bradshaw might
be able to help you with travel facilities, if you
would send hi r.; the relevant details.
I am sending a copy of this letter to Color el
Bradshaw.
Yours sincerely

Dear Isham,
/$M W-
I send you herewith copies of a ^
letter addressed to the Ambassador in
laris, by a certain Aland Edouard
Kohn, about the death of his wife and

I doubt whether Mr. Kohn’s
evidence would be of any value, in

Your Excellency,
I have just read in the Press that your
victorious armies are going to judge, in Germany,
war criminals.
I therefore think that it is my duty to add
a document of indictment to the trial and I write
to you to ask you to have the kindness of giving
this document to the competent British military
Authorities.
Apologizing for the disturbance that I may
cause, I beg your Excellency to believe in my

My dear Clyde,
I have been approached mth a request for informa-
tion on the following matter:
Louis Alexis GAS, a Frenchman born on the 27th
December 1894 at Neuilly-sur-Seine, left the concentration camp
of OHRDRUF on 13th March.19’:-5 for that of BELSHN, with some
1,500 other deportees. On their arrival at Belsen, they were
incarcerated in Block 14 and were left to die of utter starvation.
There seems to be no doubt that M. GAS
died five days only after his arrival at BELSEH, on the 20th March.
Nevertheless, an official confirmation of his death might t>e
obtained from the British authorities who are at present conducting
the trial of the concentration camp personnel,
Would it also be possible to inquire into the.
case of Monsieur Claude SANDER, born in 1919» No* Matricule 77,222.
With many thanks.
Yours sincerely.
(Signed.) Andre Gros.
P.S. By the way, would it be too much to ask for a full stenographic
record of the Belsen trials, when copies are available1*﻿3(vpJ

Agronsky of the Palestine Post has asked that this
Government should agree; e for a Miss Isabella Rubenstein of Televiv to
travel at once by air to Luneburg so that she may give evidence for the
prosecution at the trial of Irma Greese and others. Miss Rubenstein is
stated b Max Brod, the Jewish writer, (now in Televiv) to have been
an inmate of Oswiecitn and other concentration camps and to be able
to give unusually clear .evidence, especially against Irma Greese,
involuting new facts not previously published. If her evidence would
still be receivable, it might be desirable to assist. Grateful for
early advice.

Dear Bradshaw,
Referring to our conversation the other day, I think arrange-
ments ought to be made for the War Office film of Belsen Camp to be
at Nuremberg for showing during the trial, A military witness
will also be required merely to prove the taking of the film: in
the Belsen file of depositions there is, I believe, a statement by
this soldier.

Dear Sir,
Our attention has been drawn to a report in the
Daily Telegraph, under date, 2nd October, 1945, of the
Belsen trial. The report is under the signature of
Anthony Mann, Daily Telegraph Special Correspondent, and
concludes as follows:-
"Following his evidence, Dr. Sigismund Bendal
stated privately that 20 or 30 dentists were employed in
the extraction of teeth from corpses removed from the gas
chambers. He believed that 17 tons of gold, taken from
tooth fillings, we e obtained in this manner during his
period at Auschwitz".
Several of our Members have drawn our attention
to the above report, and the matter will be raised at an
early meeting of our Council. The Council will be asked
to take what steps may be possible to ensure that under no
circumstances will the Association associate professionally
in future, with any German Dental Association of which one
of these twenty or thirty dentists is a member. My
Council will undoubtedly ask me what steps we can take to
ensure that such a resolution, if carried, can be given
effect to. At the moment, it seems to me, that this can
only be done, if we could ascertain the names of the
dentists concerned. The purpose of this letter, therefore,
is to ask whether a copy of this letter can be sent to the
Prosecuting Council, or to the Solicitors in Charge of
the Prosecution, vath the request that we may be informed
as to the whereabouts of Dr. Bendel, so that we may obtain
the information from him. Or, that the Prosecution, if it
has access to the information, can make it available for the
purpose indicated.
Yours sincerely,-

We have received a note from the French
Embassy to the effect that Kramer is wanted by the
French Government for atrocities committed at the
camp of Struthof in Alsace, when he was head of that
camp. The United nations War Crimes Commission have
put Kramer on their list at the. instance of the
French Government.
2.	The French Embassy have pointed out that in
the event of Kramer not being condemned to death for
the crimes which he committed at Belsen, the French
Government would require him for trial by Military
Court at Strasbourg for the crimes committed at
Struthof.
3.	We imagine that, in the unlikely event of
Kramer not being condemned to death, the Polish
Government might also ask for him for trial on account
of his crimes at Auschwitz.
4.	We should be grateful if the military authoritie
‘sponsible for Kramer's detention could be informed of

KRAMER IS ASKING FOR AN ACQUITTAL.
Lunebur , Thursday.- Defence counsel started
their final pleas to-day in the Relsen horror
damp trial, now in its 46th day. It is expected
to end within a week.
Pleas for acquittal were made on behalf of
Josef Kramer, the Belsen camp commandant, Fritz
jCLein, the camp doctor, Peter T'eingartner, and ,
Georg Kraft by their counsel i.ajor T.Winwood.
"Kramer had nothing to do with the gas chambers
at Auschwitz and obeyed orders," he said. "At
Belsen he was the victim of circumstances."
Referring to his ijemork, in opening the defence,
that the concentration camps contained "the dregs
of the ghettoes of Central Europe," Major 'Jinwood
so id:
"1 personally regret that any words which may
have been spoken by me should have added to the
pain of that race which has suffered so much in
Nazi Germany. I have been acting only as the
mouthpiece of the accused."

Reference your minute dated 17th inst. relating to a parliamentary \
question for Wednesday, 21 November 1945, by Major Wilkes. I set out below
a suggestion of redraft of the reply.
*
DlbiPT	iffl ‘
1	The prosecution at the Belsen Trial did not put forward the contention
that being a member of a concentration camp guafd constituted a war crime; it
sought to prove that each accused did some overt act of cruelty against
persons interned therein.
2	The transcript of the summing up of the Judge advocate has not yet been
received and it is consequently not possible to check the accuracy of the Press
report. In any event, any statement which the Judge advocate made was an
expression of his own opinion and it cannot be considered to be a ruling
binding on any subsequent court convened under army Order 81/45. tIt is not
the policy at present to launch any proceedings under the army Order against
a member of the guard of any concentration camp merely on the evidence that
he was such a member.^
3	Under article 10 of the Charter relating to the Nuremburg trials the
International Military Tribunal there will be asked to declare that the S.a.,
3.S., Gestapo and other bodies are criminal organisations. In the event of
that court deciding that they were in fact criminal organisations, in so
assuming, members of those organisations can be tried before international
military or occupation courts and, if found guilty of being members,punished.

with being ooroemed in i:e ill-treatment of interneea

doven of these accused and one other afoo was not
indicted on the .elsen charge were indicted on a si liar
chargt Lth regard to Vuschwitz.
f the forty-four persons who were finally tried,
twenty-six were found guilty of the charge in respect of
Belsen ana ten in reepect of the charge relating to
'tosehwite*
Of the thirty persons woo were finally convicted on
either, one charge or another, eleven *«re sentenced to

Record of Telephone Conversations/9, 10 and 11 Dec 45 regarding Secretary
of State's powers under Regulation 12/Army Order 81/45 in relation to the
Belsen trial.
1.
9 Deo 45.
HI l(a) (Verschoyle) said it had Been reported on the ITireless on 8 Dec
that F-M Montgomery had confirmed the sentences of death on the eleven Belsen
accused sentenced to death, and that the Secretary of State for War could
mitigate the sentences. He said the Press had asked him to confirm the latter point.
2.
Having studied Army Order 81/45, File 0160/2498, the Army Act, and KR, I
told PR l(a) (Ferschoyle)j
(a)	that the Secretary of State had power to mitigate, remit, or commute
punishments, under A081/45 Regulation 12.
(b)	that the accused had no right to submit any Petition in addition to their
petition to F-M Montgomery, who has already rejected the Petitions presented by
the Belsen convicts t
(c)	that there was no procedure laid down for bringing sentences of death
before the Secretary of State for review,
(d)	that the primary purpose of Regulation 12 was to enable a superior officer
who had delegated powers of confirmation to a subordinate to recommend to the
Secretary of State an alteration in a sentence confirmed by his subordinate where
this appeared to the superior officer to be advisable,
(e)	that as F-M Montgomery had just confirmed the sentences of death, it was
obvious that he at any rate did not intend to recommend any mitigation etc., but
it would be always open to anyone else to move the Secretary of State to intervene,
or the Secretary of State might intervene of his own accord.
I advised Verschoyle simply to confirm that the Secretary of State did have the
power ascribed to him, and not to enlarge upon how he might be moved to intervene,
or the likelihood of intervention.
He fully appreciated all these points.
5.
10 Dec 45.
I explained to Col. HALSE JAG (Mil. Dept.) that the question of exercise of
the S of S's powers under Regulation 12 had arisen. He asked whether S of S had
delegated his powers, and I replied that he had not. He agreed that there was
nothing laid down regarding references to the S of S, and I said we were going to
consider this aspect of the matter.
4»
HQ BA0R(Garside) enquired with reference to their telegram A(PS4) 5191 of
21 Nov whether we wanted any of the Belsen accused who had been sentenced to death
for further interrogation. He said that unless they heard to the contrary this
afternoon the accused would be moved to place of execution.
I enquired from Drew, Principal Private Secretary to the S of S, whether in
view of the publicity that had been given to the S of S's powers, the S of S was
expecting to be approached by us in connexion with their exercise. Drew asked
what would have been the situation if there had been no publicity, and I replied
that there would have been no approach to the S of S.
/He

• * ♦ ®﻿-2-

He stated that the publicity had been most unfortunate, for the S ofS had been
pestered by the Press at his home in Durham asking for his decision in the matter*
I explained the situation as in 2 above, and he asked me to get definite confirmation
from HQ BAOR that no recommendation for mitigation was being submitted to S of S.
6.
I phoned HQ BAOR (Harris) who confirmed that no recommendation for mitigation
was being made. He said he had no idea who had told the Press about Regulation 12.
He had been asked about it a few days before, and had answered that it did not apply
in the circumstances of this case. I asked him to make enquiries about the origin of
the press reports.
I confirmed that we did not want the accused for interrogation.
7.
I told Drew that no recommendation for mitigation was being made. He asked what
would be done now. I said that the accused would be executed in a day or two.
He said that was all right. I asked if he meant the Secretaiy of State would not
intervene, and he said that was correct.
8.
I informed HQ BAOR (Harris) that the Secretary of State did not propose to
intervene.
He enquired whether that went for all other cases too. I answered Ye£ unless _
they heard to the contrary. I said we would consider Aether any action was required
to clarify the situation with regard to Regulation 12 in future cases.

Sir,
I have to report that on the 1st. of August
1946, correspondence Ref. No. SIB/0PS/2047/46 dated
30th. July, 1946, with attached correspondence Ref. No.
PM/F/555 from D.P.M. War Office, dated 26th. July, 1946,
was received at this Office from A.P.M. Operational Wing
S.I.B. The correspondence was relative to the alleged
shooting of English and French P.O.W. at TORGAU with
an original letter written in German to the Daily Mirror.
It was directed that enquiries be made to trace the.
typewriter on which the letter was typed, and persons
having access to it in an endeavour to trace the P.O.W.
responsible. Owing to the letter having been posted in
CATTERICK, YORKS, it was suggested that enquiries be
made at all P.O.W. Camps in that Area.
In company with L/Cpl. WILLIS, S.I.B., I
commenced enquiries and visited the P.O.W. Camus at the
Stadium, CATTERICKf YORKS.* and the 121 Camp, Scriven Hall,
KNARESBOROUGH, YORKS., where a thorough inspection of
all typev/riters was made, but with a negative result.
On the 8th. August, 194r6, accompanied by
Ji/CPL. WILLIS, S.I.B., I went to the 247 Camp, Vrebank
Camp, RIPON, YORKS.., where I saw Major CRESSWKLL-GEORGE,
the Assistant Commandant and explained the facts of the
case to him, and in his presence all typewriters in the
camp were tested. It was found that an Imperial
Typewriter No. 7080213 used in the Quartermaster’s Office
had a few peculiarities identical with those on the
original letter in German, although it may not have been
the machine used by the writer. (A test copy made on this
typewriter is attached. )
A check was made to trace men who may have
done Detention in Germany prior to becoming Prisoners of
Ytfar, and it was found that one man had done Detention
at Camp 7, ESTERWEGEN, ASCHEHDORF, HU!LING, which was
also a"" Concentration Camp, and I learned from Major
CRESSWELL-GEORGE that about two months ago this man made
application for repatriation to Germany in order that he
might impart important information to the British
authorities there and assist them to good advantage in
any investigation ensuing from this information. This
application had been passed on to War Office for action.
It was also learned that this man was
detained in the TORGAU Sandpits for six weeks. It may
be ascertained that this man could be the author of the
letter, as the circumstances recorded above point strongly
to him.

Enquiries with regard to'the posting of the

being posted in Catterick as trucks go from the
Camp at Ripon to Catteridg Camp daily, and it may have
been posted there by that means.

Dear Sir,
We received to-day the
enclosed anonymous letter from a German
prisoner of war in this country. You
will see from the envelope that it was
posted in Gatterick Camp.
As it concerns the
execution and burial of British personnel
at a place named Torga^ it is possible
that it may be of interest or use to you.
Yours truly.

Ich bin ein deutacher Kriegsgefangensr im England, und antworte auf dem

Ich war beinahe 3 Jahre in einem deutsohen Wehrmaohtsatraflager als
^efangener wegen einer Bagatelle. Daaelbat lernte ich verschiedene engl.bzw.
franzoesische Soldaten kennan,die auoh als ^efangene waren und zum'|bde ver-

der Flucht oder aehnliohen S achen zum Tode verurteilt worden.

Gefreiter Karl ECKEAEDT.
The above F.Y was interrogated to ascertain if he wrote an
anonyaous letter to the Daily Mirror in July describing conditions in
TORGAU Camp.
ECKEIARnr's life story is attached. It is clear from the inter-
rogation that although in TORGAU for a month in 1941, he is not the man
who wrote the letter to the Daily Mirror. He declares that he never saw
any British or French prisoners in TORGAU, but if he had done so he v/ould
have reported the matter openly, as he did in the case of PAPENBURG Con-
centration Camp.
It is suggested that the Commandants of all FW Camps in the
GATTERICK area should announce an invitation to the writer of.the lottor
to come forward(as ho offers to do )so that the matter ho mentions can
bo investigated by tho British authorities.

VOLUNTARY STATEMENT BY Bf
LD 1528 Gefreiter Karl ECKHARDT
Curriculum Vitae
I, Karl ECKHARDT born 24 Dec 1914 the son of a war-widow at
ALBSHAUSEN Kreis WETZLAR (HESSEN-NASSAU) attended here the
Elementary School (Volksschule) from my sixth till my fourteenth
year* After this I did three and a half years as a painter's
apprentice and during this time attended the technical School
(Berufsschule) for two years. In October 1935 1 was called up
to the 10th Company, Infantry Regiment 97 at BUIZBACH (HESSEN).
At first I was called up for one year but afterwards to do two
yeats. Prom 11 October 1937 till 27 August 1939 I worked as
an optician at ERNST LEITZ, WETZLAR.
On 27 August I was called up for war-service to the third Company
181 * On 8 October we were sent into action in the STIPFTSWALD
just in front of SECCHERNHOEHE in the West* Here I received the
order to advance further but did not obey it: Season : because
my Christian faith forbids me to turn a weapon against a human
being, I was therefore sentenced to throe years' pehal
servitude by the Court Martial of 370 Division for cowardice in
face of the enemy, I went, however, to Concentration Camp 7
ESTERWEGEN for a hostile altitude to the state. Here I was
received by (cries of) traitor, blows with rubber truncheons and
rifle butts. Here I had to spend two years and three months
under conditions of bad feeding, very heavy work and ill-treatment.
During this time I was, from July 1941 to August 1941 at the
fortress of VOR-ZINNA, TORGAU on the ELBE for observation. Had
to return to ESTEKWEGEN where the SS gave me an even greater
reception! Instead of returning hone after completing my
sentence I was punished again and in July 1 942 went to the Russian
front on probation (370 Division) but soon got malaria and bn
account of that spent the time till 8 May 1944 in hospitals, apart
from short intervals. On 12 July I went to Prance with 353
March Battalion* On the journey I got malaria again and went to
CHARLON on MARNE hospital. On 8 August 1944 I came out of
hospital and on the march to the front I was captured by the
Americans on 20 August! Here I worked voluntarily on the bringing*
up of supplies. But I then got malaria again and went to hospital
at CHERBOURG, Fran there I came to ENGLAND on 8 October, On
21 December I went to Camp 247, RIP0N-YORKSHIRE where I worked up
till the present day. Including as prisoner of war I have been
altogether behind barbed wire for nearly five years,and I am in a bad
mental condition, I beg the British authorities to consider me for
dismissal! Commandant, of ESTERWEGEN Obergruppenfuehrer SCHAEFER,
Commandant of TORGAU Oberst KEMMLIGER.
I made all these statements to the Commandant of Camp 247 tut have
not given a report to any British newspaper,
I have made the above statement voluntarily and without compulsion.

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movements of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(а)	ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appropriate registered file is not available. When it Is essential for a
branch to obtain quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely to need to refer to the file in order to formulate
their views, It is often appropriate to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms., or the substance of them,
must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(б)	INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “domestic” records or discussions within a directorate, etc.; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions
which may or may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c) COVERS FOR-UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to
involve much interbranch discussion.
8. If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one
of the following ways :—
(a) By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered file ;
{b) By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4. The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in a registered file, by another branch.

LEUTNANT LASZLO PATO
both of 1st Battalion, 1st Hungarian Tank Regt.
Murder of BELLA FHEUNDLICH
Murder of two unknown Polish Nationals.
1	I am instructed by the Judge Advocate General of the Forces to return
this case which was. refei'red here by DJAG at your headquarters. The case has now
been registered with the United Nations War Grimes Commission as a war crime. The
fiat of the Attorney General has not been applied for as the victims were not
British nationals.
2	The Judge Advocate General has instructed me to convey to you the following
advice with regal’d to the case*
3	In my opinion the evidence justifies the trial by military court under the
Royal Warrant of the above-named Leutnant Ujvary upon the following charge;-
COMMITTING A WAR CRIME
in that he
at Belsen, Gerraany, on 14th April 1945 in violation of the laws and usages of war
did kill Bella Freundlich, an allied national.
4	I am further of opinion that Leutnant Las=lo Pato should be tried upon
the following charge ;-
COMMITTING A WAR CRIME
in that he
at Belsen, Germany, on 15th April 1945 in violation of the laws and usages of war
did kill two allied nationals whose identity is unknown.
5	In each case the accused should be attached to a unit and the commanding
officer should sign the charge sheet as such in accordance with paragraph 4 of the
Regulations for the Trial of War' Criminals as set out in Army Order 81 of 1945-
6	In the heading of the charge sheet in each case the accused should be
described as "of the Hungarian Army in charge of...........(unii^ pursuant to
regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War Criminals.
7	With regal’d to the evidence in the case of Leutnant Ujvary, the follcwing
witnesses should be called to give the evidence set omt against their names •-
(i) Gyula Procis, who should give evidence in accordance with the first two
paragraphs of his affidavit.
(£i) Dezso Bacsujlaki, who should give evidence in accordance with the first
four paragraphs of his affidavit.
(iii) Wilma Freundlich, who should give evidence in accordance with the first
three paragraphs of her affidavit. She should also
state the nationality of the deceased Bella Freundlioh.
(iv) Captain Georg Wiskidensy, who should give evidence in accordance with the
first two paragraphs of his affidavit.

who should give evidence in accordance
with their affidavits.﻿(i) Josef Szanto, who should give evidence in accordance with the first
four paragraphs of his affidavit.
/
(ii) Ferenc Holzhauser, who should give evidence in accordance with the first
three paragraphs of his affidavit.
9	The Judge Advocate General has further instructed me to say that he does
not consider these are coses in which he should depute a judge advocate to advise the
court. Nor does he consider that a judge advocate is necessary. In these
ciroumstances one of the members of the court should have legal qualifications in
accordance with Rule of Procedure (33(B). fou will doubtless make application to
DJAG at your headquarters for the appointment of such an officer. Similarly, it
is considered that the prosecution should be conducted by an officer with legal
qualifications, and application should be made to DJAG for the appointment of such
an officer.
J
In each case, in my opinion all witnesses should give evidence orally,
10
at the trial, but if any of the witnesses are not available the affidavits made
by then can be put in by the prosecution.
In my opinion these accused should be offered the services of an officer
11
with l®al qualifications to defend them at their trials. I think that the
accused should be supplied with a copy of the affidavits referred to in paragraphs
7 and 3 above. At the same time they should be offered the services of an
interpreter if they so desire. One copy of the charge sheet and abstract of
evidence in each case will be required for the use of the prosecutor.
12	I enclose three copies of the abstract together with the originals
and three copies of the evidence of witnesses (i) to (vii in paragraph 7 above
and (i) ana (ii) in paragraph 8 above, together with the originals of the affidavits
of Jozef Forgach and Sjt. Woodcock.
13	An impartial person competent to act as interpreter both in the Hungarian
and in the Rumanian languages should be available at the trial unless the witnesses
and the accused all speak German, in which case only a German interpreter will be
r@olire<i_F^.

Reference your 21 A Qp/3771V203/A(BS4) dated 21 Aug 45.
1. It is confirmed that the witnesses under reference are
at present in Belsen Camp with the following reservations:-
(a)	Capt. Georg Wiskidensky is with the Hungarian
Troops in Belsen;
(b)	2ncl/Lt. Dezso Bacsujlaki has deserted from the
Hungarian Troops in Belsen.
2* In this connection it is once more submitted that in
the particular light of the continued desertion of wanted
personnel, especially officers, from the ranks of the
Hungarians in Belsen, some degree of action should be taken
in the light of this Unit’s letters addressed to D.J.A.G-.,
ref; VC/B/ll dated,13 Jun 45 and 9 J,ul 45 & T^/B/l7 dated
21 Jul 45. The situation as previously set out in the
letters referred to remains virtually unchanged, although this
Unit has reason to believe that orders ameliorating matters
were in fact issued some time in July by 30 Corps.
3. There is every reason to believe that unless, action
be taken further deseirticns will occur. It is believed that
approximately 15^ of the Hungarian personnel have now so
deserted and there is little doubt that among these an
appreciable preportion were War Criminals.

Headquarters,
British Army	Shine,
Reference your 21 A Gp/3771l/203/A(PS4) dated 21 Aug 45 aud
this Team's letter of 31 Oct 45, enclosing list of Hungarians in
Protective Custody.
1.	A large number of Hungarians who were at Belsen have now been
sent away,among them being all those whom it was thought might possibly
try to influence the Hungarian Soldiers held in protective custody
as prospective witnesses. The main reason for holding such witnesses
seems now to have disappeared.^
2.	The remaining Hungarians in the Camp are, as they always have
been, free to move about within the Camp and are employed in various
capacities on different kinds of work.
3.	The witnesses in protective custody are, therefore, now in a
far worse position than the others at liberty in the Camp, and as is
mentioned, above because the main reason for their being kept under guard
has now disappeared it is suggested that these witnesses might now be
released and put on the same level as the others.
4.	it is suggested that there is practically no chance of any of
these prospective witnesses leaving Belsen on their own accord for
several reasons, the main ones being:-
(i) That the Hungarians who have already left Belsen have not oeen
repatriated but are held in a camp in some other part of
Germany.
(ii) It is well known by all the Hungarians here thai< conditions in
Hungary now are far from satisfactory and conditions here are
very much better.
(iii) As they have no papers of any sort it would be very dixfield.t
for them to make their way very far from Belsen even should
they so desire.
They have trade representations to this Team along the above
5.
lines and
and have asked that at least they might be given sbme sort of
employment. They have now been in custody since July 1945.
6,	Gan permission therefore be gifen by you for them to be
released from protective custody and allowed the same liberty as the
ordinary soldiers.

Lieut-Golonel T. H. Tilling, R.A.,
Ho. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team,
c/o HQ 4th Wilts,
HQHNE (BHKM) ®M£P.
TSC/B/17.
8 Dec 45.
Dear Group Captain,
I am, to put it mildly, somewhat disturbed, with regard to the
Hungarian cases which appear to he coming up for trial. This week two of them
Lieuts. PATO & UJVARY, were tried hy a Military Court at Celle on charges
of murder and both acquitted.
With regard to PATO, we only had two witnesses who were Hungarian
soldiers and these were called in person by the prosecution but apparently
were tied in knots by the defending officer, with the result as mentioned
above that PATO was acquitted. This was a possibility in this case
which we had foreseen.
With regard to tCVAHY, however, the case is most alarming
with regard to the other cases coming on in the future. I want to emphasize
that the information I am giving you about this case is not entirely first hand
it was gathered by Staff Serjeant VToodcock of this Team who was called as a
witness in this case and who, therefore, was not in the court throughout
the proceedings, but he was able to gather quite a lot of information from
the court orderly.	From"our records the following witnesses seemed to be
essential for the prosecution to call:-
J.
G.
V.
A.
L.
A.
NAGY
FOHCIS
FHEUNDLICH
SGLYOM
HETSHYI
HODOR
—	^ r ; * rn. TUG	M’Wi
Ojf'L	. TYi </OUva N® 1.
In fact according to the copy of instructions for the bringing
to the court of the witnesses, the following list shows the witnesses for
the prosecution who were asked for:-
G. PORCIS
Capt. WISKIDENSKY
J. TOlvSCANYI
M. SHLI
L. HETENYI
J. FORGACH
The following comments are made with regard to this:-
Staff-Serjeant Woodcock assures me that, to the best of his knowledge,
the only evidence offered by the prosecution was:	(1) an Affidavit which
was read of Vilma FREIMDLICH, (2) Evidence by Woodcok himself, apparently
with regard to identification, and, (3) Captain Georg Wiskidensky.
Captain Wiskidensky appears in our records as a witness for the defence
of UJVARY, and it is, therefore, not understood why he should be called for the
prosecution. With regard to the rest of the witnesses that the prosecution
asked for, FORCIS was in court hut never called, TQMSANYI and SULI were,
in my opinion, completely unnecessary and in fact were also not called.
HETENYI was also in court but not called; FORGACH against whom evidence
exists as to War Crimes was also in court but not called.
I have ascertained that NAGI, SCELYQM and HODOR are at this
moment available in Belsen and could quite easily have been called by the
prosecution.
Apparently the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence.
I do not know who was responsible for deciding on how the prosecution was
to be presented and I hesitate, with only scrappy infomation at ny disposal,
to say the case was presented wrongly. however, the fact remains that from
the above it is obvious that, unless some unknown explanation exists as to ff
the reason for the prosecution adducing such meagre evidence when plentiful '
evidence exists, the affair has been mismanaged some level. I am only i﻿-2-
Aing you this infonjiation because if this is a sample of what may happen
in the future I think that serious consideration ought to be given as to
whether the remainder of the Hungarians should be tried.
.;1 -I
lit
The local effect here has been enormous. My contacts with the
Hungarian soldiers state that -their attitude may be summed up in the
words "This is too easy, the English obviously can't do-anything about
us at all." Although I have no proof I fear that this will have the most
serious effect on the procuring of evidence with regard to Concentration
Camp Guards. The -unwillingness of witnesses to oome forward for various
reasons had at last been partially overcane but I anticipate that this
may result in a complete drying up of all further evidence from witnesses
here.
V
A further alarming side to the matter is that PATO at least is known to
have been allowed to return to this Carpi. I have arranged that he shall be
imprisoned here for his own protection as I understand he was looking
lest night for the two witnesses who gave evidence against him. Is it possible
in the future, if a Hungarian is acquitted, for him to be removed as far as possible
from this Camp and not permitted to return? I suggest most strongly that,
if it is possible, the ideal would be for any such persons to be repatriated
to Hungary at once.
Incidentally, 22 witnesses were called for the defence including the
Hungarian Padre, who is believed to have said in court that this Team had
imprisoned these Hungarians, had refused to allow anyone to see them, and had
prevented them from finding out what the charges were against them. This
in substance is true as the Hungarians have been considered by this Team
as being on 'all fours' with the S3 guards at BELSEN, none of whom, of course,
were formally charged, but only interrogated if it was thought that any useful
purpose could be served by so doing.
Another aspect of the case, of course, is the possibility that at future
Hungarian trials, no Hungarian soldier witnesses will come forward to give evidence
for two reasons: firstly, the idea that it will be useless to do so because
every Hungarian will be acquitted, and, secondly, the understandable fear that
•the acquitted person will be enabled to return here and avenge himself if he so
wishes.
I do not know on what charges UJVAIff and PATO stood trial. It might be
that TOVAEC was only charged with one case of murder. If this be so, I do not
know whether it is worth sending him for trial on the other incidents which are
alleged in the depositions against him.
Por your information the Numbers of the depositions which we considered
were useful against UJVARY are:-

Captain Alfred James Pox, General List
D.A.P.M. 36 Special Investigation Section,CMPolice
lg •	I am 28 yrs old and a Polish Jewess. I was arrested on 25th December
1939 as a political prisoner and was sent to Auschwitz in July 1942. I was
transferred to Belsen in the summer of 1944.
2.	I recognise LADISMW/GUBA (Photo 7-l) as being a Slovak and a block
fuhrer at AUSCHWITZ. One day in the summer of 1943 I saw him beat a man on the
face-and head with the butt of his rifle for speaking to a woman. The man's
head was split open and blood issued from his mouth and ears and his injuries
awoeared so bad that I had no doubt £hat he was dead. On G-URA’s orders some
orisoners had to take the victim to the male quarters. On another day in tne
summer of 1943 I saw from about 40 metres a?;ay (GEORGE KRAPT (photo 7-5) catch
a man who also was speaking to a woman. KRAUT battered the man's face and head
■f
with a stick so that his head,was gashed and blood poured from his mouth and
ears, in my opinion the man must have died since no one could have survived such
injuries. I later saw his body being taken to the male quarters by other
prisoners.
3.	On 25th December 1943 I was sick with typhus and was picked out at a
selection made by Doctors ![ENGELS and TAUBER along with about 350 other women.
I was made to undress and taken by lony to a gas chamber. There were 7 gus
chambers at Auschwitz this particular one was underground and the lorry was able
to run down the slope and strai^it into the chamber. Here we were tipped
unceremoniously on the floor. The roam was about 12 yards square and small light
on the walls dimly illuminated it. When the room was full a hissing sound was
heard coming from the centre point on the floor and gas came inoo the room.
After what seamed about 10 minutes some of the victims began to bite their hands
and foam at the mouth and blood issued from their ears, eyes and mouth and their
faces went blue. I suffered from all these symptoms together with a tight
feeling at the throat. I was half conscious when my number was callea out by
Dr. MMGELS and I was led from the chamber. I attribute my escape to. the fact
that the daughter of a friend of mine who. was an Aryan and a Dootor at Auschwitz﻿- 2
had seen me "being transported to the chamber and had told her mother who
immediately appealed to Doctor Mengele. Apparently he realized that as a
political prisoner I was of more value alive than dead and I was released.
4,	I think that the time taken to kill a person in this particular gas
chamber would be from 15 to 20 minutes.
5.	I was told that the staffs of the prisoners who worked in the gas
chamber and crematorium next door changed every 3 months. The old staix being
taken to a villa in the camp to do some repair work. Here they were locked
in the rooms and gas bombs thrown through the window. I estimate that in
December 1943 about J,000 people disappeared from Auschwitz apparently by way
of the gas chamber and crematorium.

2.	I can recognise LADISIAW GJJRA as No. 1 on Photo 7.	This man was
one of the SS men in the carip at BELSEN whilst I was there. I was employed
at Belsen as an engineer. One day atihe end of March 1945 I was given orders
to turn off the water supply. The main tap is next to a draining ditch.
Whilst I was turning off the water I heard G-URA give orders to a man to do some
repair work to the ditch. The man did not obey immediately so GURA kicked
him into the ditch in which the water was about 5 ft. deep. I pulled the
man, who was an acquaintance of mine, out of the ditch. 'Whereupon GURA beat
the victim on the head with a spade and when he fell down kicked him. I then
moved away about 30 yards from where I saw the man taken away to the si ok
block by two other prisoners. Two days later I went to see how the man was
progressing but found he was dead.	It is my opinion that his death was
attributable to the illtreatment received from GURA. I do not know the name
of the victim - we prisoners seldom knew the names of other prisoners.

Major Sevile G-ooftrey Champion, R.A. Legal Staff, No, 1 War Crises Investigation Tea.
1.	I was arrested in 1939 because I was a Jew, I an 22 years of age.
I was in various working camps until I was sent to Auschwitz at the end of
1943.	1 was transferred to Belsen in December 1944.
2.	Mi List at AUSCHSSiTZ I worked for three, -months on general duties in one
of the gas chambers and crematorium at A’ischwitz. Employees on this job
;ot better food than the rest of the prisoners due to the nature of their
work. At the end of about 6 months, however, they, themselves, would die
in the gas chamber because the SS tried to keep the oceurrencies in ths gas
chamber secret. I escaped this late because I contracted Typhus and was
removed to hospital and later to 'elson*	The following is a description of
this particular gas chamber and crematorium and the event enacted therein.
Those selected would be told, they were going for a bath. They would enter
the first room of the building where they would undress and be given towels
and soap, Tt * c room would hole about 500 people. They would then enter
the second room which gave the appearance of a shower-bath room with stone floor
and wooden duck boards. Hanging fro - the coiling were sprays. Once inside
the gas would be turned on by an SS man in a control room underneath the
’bathroom1. The people v.-oult sereag and shout in their agonly hjut the noiso
was drowned to anyone outside by a brass u m! playing outside and a wdreless
inside. Those in the	c ilc @	> ' :hr®e to	minutes*
Yeatilators would then be operated to clear the gas from, the room. As soon
as the room was clear of gas the workers, including myself, would enter it
from a door at the far end of the room end collect the corpses. The
bodies would then be put on a chute which would drop them into a subterranean
room adjacent to the crematorium ovens. In this room the corpses wouM be
received fro- • the chut© by a tipper trolley on rails which would Hold about
8 bodies at a Lime, The trolley would then be wheeled by a worker to a platform
from which the corpses would be loaded on to a metal stretcher. The base
of this consisted of three metal bars. The stretcher would then be wheeled﻿'> / . 'I
on rails into the outh of the ovon. There the bodies TO-nia be dropped into
♦
the furnace by the operator of the stretcher, who jnanoewereoE levers which
opened, the metal bars downwards. The bodies would be destroyed In about three
minutes. The fuel Cor the furnace consisted of wood and petrol. The SS .man
in charge of my party on this Job was Oberscharfuhrer TOIL. During the three
renths I was worldnc on this particular gas chamber and crematorium I estimate
that a total of clout 20,000 people met their deathethir way.
2.	I recognise MDIBIM GUM Ho, 1 on Photo 7 as being. SS ncn in charge of
a group of prisoners who collected corpses from the streets and Mocks.of
Boise;! ec.-'T. .Title was between the tlth Ar,rLl 1945 up to the tiine the British
car® on 15th April 1945« .During this tine HUM was responsible for raany
deaths and beatings which I was able to.see from qy block. GUM apparently
was not satisfied with the speed, at which this undernourished prisoners concerted
the corpses, so he would beat- the on the head and bod with the butt of his
rifle. The men would be left as dead and their bodies would.be collected by
other prisoners and taken to the burial' pit,.	About ?.Q	to	2 ware killed
each day between the dates I have mentioned in this was	at	the hands of GUM.
5, I recognise .OGOECS; KR/DT as Ho, 5 on	photo 7 as an	SS man who used	to
guard the bread and ration store at Belsen.	About the	12th April 1945
I saw several prison-rs crawl through the holes in the wire surrounding the
store- and try to roach through the window for food in the store. 7 saw
EMIT* shoot about 20 men within an hour, for this offence. I .know they
were killed as I later saw their bodies being taken to the burial pit by other
prisoners on the orders of k A As .-. o Jr«	u

I have read the statement of Klinlc and 1 can. say that the Unterscharfuhrer to wta
he referred in his statement is Untei'scbarfuhrer Hfolf, because at that time he
was the only storratrooper who wore a black rubber coat and because he othorvd.Ee
cor reap ons with the floscripdon give';, in it.
I saw the body of iiayer lying near the kitchen on a heap of straw wit a his eras
outstretched." He had a small hole in the center of his forehead made by a
pistol bullet. The sentries around this place were so disposed that, had
mmr been shot atte&pfinc t-- escape £nm the ca p, he could not posspily^ have
been shot through the center of the forehead* o'urthormore the sentries in the
watch tower lad'repeating weapons and when they killed somebody the bodies viould
be riddled with bullets. The other sodtries would have been some distance
beliixid haver had he been trying to leave the carp and were armed with French
Lebel rifles, shots 'Tide with these raeOcing much larger holes. The marks_on
those prisoners who were shot with these weapons were entirely different from
that of Meyer.
As it was my" dutv to register the dead, I brought the :.ie.tter to the notice of
Boiaerich, I believe that, if 1 seemed to know about this body, I might place
i-yself in danger. So I said to Srmerich * Who is this i&n'i I do not know tiim .
fiisnerich answered, ’Gan it an uhknomi body*.
Usually when prisoners were shot without an execution, there ware a lot of
formalities to be gone through. I used to have to get the name and nunoer
of the man and make a sketch of tiie place where lie ms found, so that they
could be shown to have been shot escaping. In this case no such formality t
was carried out. I consider it lil^ly that they bad an order to kill Mayer
from the oolitic.il dcparfer:ent of the oaig). She general policy was laid down
in Berlin" but the political department in the ca^p had authertty to kill
individual prisoners. The political departnen* ms under Obersturrafuhrer

Seport on Auschwitz:
I admit that from Ijkl the transports which, arrived at Auschwitz, among
which the women, children and old aged, v/ere condacted directly to the gas
chamber and then burnt in the crematorium.. All those persons unable to walk
were automatically passed to the gas chamber. The orders came directly
from Berlin. I admit that a transport of 4000 women and young people in
very good health of Czech nationality were all sent to the gas chamber on 9
March. There arrived day and night Hungarian transports of about 6000
persons who -were put in bloc lOj amongst these the twins and young girls
were taken away by the doctor for his experiments and the others were gassed.
The crematorium burned day and night. I admit all the brutal treatment
which the S.S. and particularly the Politische Abteiltmg imposed upon the
prisoners.
Report on Bergen Bel sen Camp
I arrived at Bergen Belsen with the rank of Eapportfuhrer. The
prisoners were very badly treated. They had no water and sometimes the
mid-day meal arrived at 11 and 12 0?clock at night. Many times the
prisoners w ere deprived of food by order of Commandant Kramer. I admit
that there was an average of 500 deaths a day. There were sufficient
rations in the stores but the orders were to let the prisoners die of
hunger. I received the order to conduct 9 girls to the crematorium and
to shoot them beforehand. About a month ago I received the order to go
and fetch from the prisonners camp the Englishman Meyer Keith, the only
Englishman and I took him to the Blockfuhrerstubs where he was assassinated
by the Haupispharfuhrer Bals, assisted by the Enterscharfuhrer Wolf. The
nest morning Meyer Keith was found in front of kitchen 11 with a bullet
in his head. I admit having killed with my own hands about 15 prisoners
while under the influence of drink, and even on the.day of the arrival of
the English having killed a prisoner who was rejoicing at the arrival Oi
the Tommies. I admit having also received the order from Commandant
Kramer, through Commandant Mayer to blow up the camp which was ruined on
tlie arrival of the English.

I Iisve been in the S.S. since 1938. Between 26. %. 45 and to-day 22.4.45.
I was at the "AUEENT1IALTSLAG-3SR" at Bergen Belsen. Uy appointiaent was
"MH’ORTFUIffiM1' ( ------- ) to replace the one who had been posted to a front
line unit. It was my job to make out the daily strength report, (men!; ~
womens' camp seperately).
Hen's Caiapt 6900
350 died in Camp.
1500 have arrived, 80 or 100 dead and 500 - 400 sick people who were
unable to walk, and who had in many cases been on the way from 8-14
days without sufficient food.
Women1s Camp;	26,660
173 deaths.
Inhabitants of the Camp: 7613
14 deaths.
Shortly before the Allied troops arrived at Belsen I was ordered with
2 other SS men to transport 6 women to the crematorium. (I learned later that
somebody wanted to poison them), fhey were JajTthere. The number of deaths in
Camp are caused mainly by bad and insufficient food. There was a complete lack
of sanitation and medical supplies. There was very little water as we had
no river.	There was hardly enough for the kitchen and the prisoners had
About a forthight ago I got the order to go to the Camp with one man
and the LA<rER A'Lri=rr£ and to fetch a prisoner (an Englishman) and to hand him
over to the Commandant at the Block fuhrer's office. The man who wes English.
end the only Englishman in the Camp wasfl&Cfc. The reasons for shooting him
unknown to mo. I cannot say who shot him as I was called away immediately after
I had handed him over.
tn documents and files were destroyed six days before the allied
troops arrived.
Bad clothing and shoes are also the cause of many illnesses and deaths.
Within the last two months 1600 people have died in this Camp for the
following reasons : little food, bad clothing, many batches of prisoners arriving
during the last few weeks half starved and ill. These prisoners Mtku* e free
camps which lied to be evacuated. As to medical care for prisoners, there were
no facilities at all, 0ceomodation was bad, no beds and there was no means of
making life any better for the prisoners in this Camp.
At the camps in AUSCHWITZ batches of prisoners case in continuously fran
1942 - 1944. It also happened then that prisoners from the camp were sent
to the crematorium. I as not well informed about the numbers of people killed
in Auschwitz but as on estimate I would say about a million. There were a so
several executions through shooting.
I was in AUSCHWITZ as "AEE®ITa)IEHSTPUIIE3R,! (official in charge of
work).
When "consignments” of Jews 01 ived. they were examined and accora.t.ng to
the result of this examination they were either admitted to the Csmp or sent
to tire crematorium where they were gassed. Usually they were women with
small children up to 34 years and. old men over 60. As far as I know^ 2 to 3
"consignments" arrived per day from all countries of Europe. A consignment was
about 2,500 strong of whom 550 men and 300 to 400 women were sorted out for work.
The remainder was dealt with as described above (Gas chamber)• This went on
from 1942 to 1945.	,.	.	.	.
The state of affairs in the camp in general was not particuiorly good,.
At the camp in BIBKBHAU people had to stand 3 to 4 hours on parade. ^ snitary
arrangements were insufficient end many people died as a consequence of this
Several SS men who were i/e of gangs of prisoners for work illtreated

And then he
went out
TWO months ago news reached
the mother and father of
Ordinary Seaman Keith Mayor,
21. Naval Commando, that he
was a prisoner of war. He had
been reported “missing” in June
1943.
They had been preparing, at
Margaret-road. Preston, for his
homecoming.
Now they have heard from the
Admiralty that their son was
shot by the Germans at Sachsen-
hausen concentration camp. En-
closed with the official letter was
another—reproduced above.
It was a last message from
Kei/th, written just before he was
t&ken out to be shot. And this
is what he said.
Dearest mother and father and
all. All my love, and having
you will not forget your only
son. God bless you all, and God
save the King. Yours ever,

I can give tills inforcu-tion about the concentration camp at
Gaclrsonhausec.. Wien I arrived at this camp there were about 700 Russian
Prisoners of War, I talked to many of these sen and I was told that they
wore the only Russia prisoners loft alive of an original hatch of 14,000
Russian prisoners of war taken to- the camp. According to all those I
spoke to the other 13,300 had all 'been Idlllod. it raie a £.;noral praotiee

most of whoa wore officers, including siz doctors. One of these officers
was taken out or bceb clearance and did not return, I was told that he
had been killed by sc uncsploded ’oamb tiiich he was digging out. Soon
after I aaaprtS at the t anp betw® n 35 —4-0 Suasian prisoners of war-, most
of whan were officers, were brought there from btalag 3B* I recognised
them as eoac of the roeu tortured bad acora.ed by KEAUSK, fheoe prisomrs
were isolated from the rest and I later saw them aaiched off to the cangj-
ozotnatoriunu they dll not all go at onoo, but in parties spread over
the year 1944. I did not sea them again after that. I was told by other
prisoners that they had bee; killed'and put in tlic cr-or; toritBa, After
seeing the prisoners marched to the cmaatorium I saw the .. guards return
without them. I do not know who was the CJornaandart of foohsanhscuaea
but one of those reponsiblc .lor those atrocities was the Cans) Leader

I was beam in Leipzig on 23. 7. I9IO (parents Wilhelm Wolf, agent,
and Maria Wolf, me Bei^mam). Ifiy father was treasurer of a freemason's
lodge, and my education \ma based on the ideas and ideals of this world-
wide organisation.
When I was 18 I had completed my training in the insurance agency of
ny father. I worked in the Foreign department there. Most of ny father's
clients were industrialists, owners of department stores and middle class
business people, most of them also members of the lodge. Partly through
business connections, partly through friendly relations with these people
ny philosoply, the seed of which was planted by my father, was greatly
strengthened. For a short while I led the youth movement within ay
father's lodge.
When in 1933 National Socialism caias into power I could get myself
only after years to find seme inner contact with the movement. I tried
to establish this contact by volunteering for sis months service in the
National Labour Service. Ibis service is very well organised an! demanded
first and foremost comradeship and service for the oomraunity. I knew
these clearly defined and clean ideas already fran the familiar philosophy
of the mason's lodges whoa had also mad© humanity and readiness to help
each other like brothers their first oenmand. I thought to find in the S3
an order comprising men who had iaade these ideas in their purest form
their law. I found these ideas with the S3, but only for our own people.
Later in 38, 41 and 45 during my time of service in concsentx-aticai ca2^>s I
found a hard and. merciless enmity against the Jewish people which I could
no longer reconcile with ny present views, all the mors as I got to know
and to appreciate Jewish people for decades, partly through personal
friendships during ny s chool term partly in the lodge and through business
contact.
But I could no longer leave the SS without being despised as a traitor
to the "fatherland". (Up to this day I have not yet been accepted into the
party). On 7* 11. 39 I was called sip into the "Waf en SS". I bed ny
infantry training in Berlin. My battalion was stationed in Lublin (Poland).
I was despatched with some of ny comrades (under the command of ny 2/ht.)
to'a place on '®hat was then the Hussian border, with the special mission
to settle the Seaman Nationals from Galicia aid Wohlynia there.
In 1940 I was transferred to Hie West* and towards the end of the year
went to Arahaisa in Holland. I was thenreleased and went back to Gemary
where I worked in the office of an aerodrome in Halle until 25. 2. 41. I
tried through my OG to get a release fraa the SS to Join the Luftwaffe,
but without success. I was called up	into the SS on 25*	2.	41, and	as I
was unfit for front line service owing	to a grave illness	in	earlier	days
I was posted as a guard to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. I served two
years as a guard, then sis months as assistant of the 0 i/c in the welfare
office (theatre, cinema, consorts, etc. for the troops)j then six months
in the Battalion Orderly Hocra. As the BSM kept on annoying me, I took
an opportunity which presented itself and volunteered for the "Sohutzhaftlager”
(esarp for political prisoners). There I was - in view of my commercial
experience - employed in Hie office and later as assistant Happortfuhrer.
I stayed there for one year until we evacuated the camp on 23. 1. 45* whan the
Russians were approaching. I went to	Dachau on 7. 2. 45	in	an administrative
capacity and was transferred to Belsen	on 18. 3* 45, where I	arrived	on
23. 3. 45. Here I was employed for the first fortnight as Blockfuhrer in
camp No. 1, and in the labour office.
As to ny experience in concentration camps and ny attitude towards
them, I must say that unless I had seen it and lived through it myself I
would not have believed such injustice and inhuman cruelly as you find it
in these camps possible. With sane of my comrades I tried repeatedly to
get away by volunteering for service at Hie front, but tne Lamp Coranandant﻿.2.
pointed out that he needed eveiy man and that we would have to do our duty
whereever we were put.
It struck ms as one of the greatest injustices that people who weze
in for political reasons or even people who had remained faithful to their
country (e.g. Poles, etc) who should have been in a respectable internment
camp, war© put in concentration camps with criminals as "Blockaltesta",
capos, etc. (i.e. as a sort of senior'tsoner in charge of them). The
affect of this measure was that these decent prisoners were beaten up,
deprived of their rations and otherwise tortured by the habitual criminals.
In my capacity as a guard of working parties I always interfered and
stopped such things going on. Once for instance I succeeded in saving
the lives of 15 Jewish prisoners who were to be shot in a line working
party in a forest near Hadostowita (Upper Silesia) b cause they had taken
apples from a tree anl had been discovered by Blookfuhrer Ernst Groh. This
was extremely quick tempered and had beaten the prisoners and then drawn
his pistol and put the safety catch back and was actually aiming at one of
them. Knowing him as I do he would have shot them. They were all
people who were in a concentrati n camp only because they belonged to the
Jewish race. I could not keep ray temper and jumped towards him, yelling
at him to put the pistol away. Through my interference he calmed down
and did not cany out his intentions.
I succeeded together with the 4 other guards (all decent old. comrades,
reservists over 30 who had themselves a family and home) to get the 15
prisoners of our ''cojairsando’' decent treatment and decent food. I spent
six months at this commando, and whan my Gotapany fetched me back to
Auschwitz and 1 saidgood-by© to the 15 prisoners in their barracks there
were tears in eyeiT as they feared that as I was leaving somebody else
would come in ray place. But as Blockfuhrer Groh had been aken away
before and there was a decent Blockf. in -command aid ay old comrades as
guards the work of the ,,ccGIluando', was carried on in the manner I had
Initiated. On the whole, I have gained the in^ressicn from my activities
in oensentration camps that it depends to a great extent on the comandant
and leaders down to the "Happortfuhrer" and "Blockfuhrer" whether the life
of the prisoners is bearable or not. During my time et Birkenau.
concentration carap this camp was commanded by 3S Stbf. Hart gens tein, who
mad® life easier for the prisoners in many ways and to whom the prisoners
were very much attached.	He enforced the order of the S.F.S.S. (Himmler)
that it is unworthy of an SS man to beat a defenceless prisoner.
What was psychologically unbearable and also got me dam physically
in these last two years were the repeated murder of Jews which have bean
known to the world for a long while. Though I had nothing to do with it
directly, I felt partly responsible as a German. Explanations Aose
who said that these were reprisals for raids on inhabited quarters of
towns which were said to have been engineered by responsible leaders of
international Jewry I did not think sufficient.
In my position as deputy Bapportfuhrar I succeeded in saving many
individual cases and also one© a whole group of 80 Jewish children frem
fheresienstadt from that fate. I simply transferred these children and
sent 60 of them to Braunschweig, to an apprentice school for prisoners.
As these children had already been destined for that dreadful fate, doing-
’ this could have been the end of me if it had been noticed. We succeeded
by extreme cleanliness and continuous delousing and medical superexeno*
as well as good food to keep the male oanrp at Birkanau free from infectious
diseases and to reduce the death rate to a minimum. % 1st Happortfuhrer
(o/Schaf) Polotzek, was also in favour of tweeting the prisoners well, and
I have never seen him beat a prisoner. I found that my activities, which﻿﻿Of the others I know neither the name nor their appointment. According
to statements from other commies 3 or 4 az-e supposed to tie missing. I
have not yet ascertained the names. Whether they left in civilian clothes
or in uniform with the aid of the others or without I cannot say. Neither
can I say whether they left on thair own or with the aid of any organisation,
or where they were making for.
The reason why Belsen camp was handed over to the English is that
neither the Getnaans nor the English wanted the diseases in the camp (spotted
fever* typhus, etc.) to spread, or that both the German civil population
or the British soldiers should be .infected. Shat would have happened
if the camp had bean left without a guard evanonly for a day and all the
inmates would have left it in masses and mixed with the civilian population.
Therefore the German guards had to stay till the British guards took over.
The reason why 1 hid in civilian clothes within the o£*ap at the last
minute on 17. 4» 45 was that I was in the camp when the other SS men were
arrested, and therefore knew nothing about all that. As I was told that
all SS men were being arrested 1 wanted to go and give myself up at the
■'Kcm^andatur" (Gamp Commandant*s Office), On iqy way I saw the hearse
with the SS men and realised the state they wore in. To avoid this
shameful treatment which I had not discovered by the way I have lived and
behaved up to now and to keep at a certain distance freta the others, I
all of a sudden made up my mind to hide in civilian clothes and to pose as
a/f^lSner. I got myself same civilian clo hes, but was detected after
a few hours, that is to soy I was given away by a prisoner. The pistol
which I carried is my private property. It has been in my possession for
over six years and could not get myself to abandon it.
About Kramer*s short period as Goasaandant of the concentration camp
Birfcenau before ho came to Belsen 1 cannot say much as we did not see much
of him in the men’s camp. He concerned himself mostly with the women's
camp. We called him our first Blockfuhrer because hwias so concerned with
petty details. He noted numbers of prisoners who were drunk on working
parties and demanded punishments, mostly of a petty nature. In most of
the cases he did not concern himself with the execution of the punishment
so that 2 nearly always had an qpportaiily to destroy the numbers.
U/Schaf. Eadduk in Auschwitz end Strm. Weiss in Birkenau were known
for beating up prisoners continuously*
I would furthermore like to mention that in Auschwitz 1 had never
taken part in an execution. In case of need volunteers were always used
for this purpose. During fee short period of ny assy here I know of no
executions.

At Saclisenhausen there was a German prisoner named LT1I8T SIEGEL
who acted as an interpreter. He was about 36 years of age, height 6ft 1-2 ins.
stout build, blonde-,hair, round face,, red complexion, grey eyes and athletic
appearance. At the beginning of .February 1945 at the time, when the Russian
armies were on the' river Oder about SO Russian prisoners of war were called out
on parade. I heard that they were paraded in the camp and that SIEGEL was
present. He was dressed as an S. S. man in uniform. He told these 80 prisoners
that Germany needed educated persons for key positions and that they had been
selected. They were then taken to Block 58. This was about 10 o'clock at
night. About half an hour later these prisoners were marched out of the
camp and I never saw them again. 'Shortly .afterwards I heard shooting outside
the camp and I was told by other prisoners that the 80 men had attempted to
escape because they were going to' the Crematorium and had all been shot by
S.S. guards. I was told by other prisoners that they had seen the clothing
of the men brought back into the camp. Later on thaij night 96 other prisoners,
including British prisoners of war (about six- or seven other ranks), about
30' Luxemburgers, French and Russian prisoners, were marched out of the camp.
At about 4 a.m. I heard more shooting and I was told later by other prisoners
.that these 96 men had also been shot. The 98 prisoners included a number of
my friends and I have not seen any of them since that night. 'When I first
arrived at Sachsanhausen there 'were eight or nine British soldiers there who
told me they had been captured at NARVIK in Norway. One of them I knew by
the name- of MAJOR.. These British soldiers were made to run round the camp
all day and "every day testing the wearing qualities of German boots. Six 01-
seven of them were among those killed vrhen the $6 .prisoners were marohed from
the'camp. The other-two British soldiers, includin MAJOR, came to Belsen
with me. Included in the 96 prisoners that were shot that night were the
follwoing Russian prisoners all of whom I knew:-	->
•Major General SEMION TKATSOHENKO, Doctor-BORIS TQKARTSQHOK, and Lieutenant
NIKOLAI NASAEOW.
After we arrived at Belsen one of the British soldiers was sent to
Stettin. MAJOR, who was ill with typhus, remained in the camp.	I_remember
one morning, shortly before British troops arrived in the camp-, seeing
Doctor HORSTMANN, who had come from Sachsenhausen to Belsen, examine MAJOR.
I have previously described Doctor HORSHAANIi. He took MAJOR'S tdaroerature
and made a brief examination! He thraTwrote down MAJOR'S particulars. That
same evening MAJOR was taken out of the camp Hospital.
MAJOR was in the next Hospital Block to the Hospital in which I worked,
and when he was moved I heard the voice of S.S. man EMMERICH. Alter that
I never saw MAJOR again. Many prisoners in the camp told me that be had been
shot by EMMERICH. Until that day I have never seen Doctor HORSTMANN examine
any patient in the camp and. in view of what happened to MAJOR in the evening
I consider that llORSTMANN was, in some-way, connected with his death.___________„﻿SKTRACT of statement made by imtOLAJ SCffidJ-AKOW (Male) late of

I can give this information about the concentration camp at
Sachsenhausen. When I arrived at this Oamp there were about 700 Russian
Prisoners of War. I talked to many of these men and I was told that they
were the only Russia prisoners left alive of an original batch of 14,000
Russian prisoners of war taken to the camp. According to all those I
spoke to the other 13,300 had all been killed. It,was a general practice
at the camp to make prisoners work on the bomb clearance, in the Berlin area.
I arrived at the camp in company with 13 other Russian prisoners of war,
most of whom were officers, including skc doctors. One of these officers
was taken out on bomb clearance and did not return. I was told that he
had been killed by rir uneirplodefi bomb' which he vras digging out. Soon
after1 I arrived at the camp between 35 and 40 Russian prisoners of war, most
of whom were officers, were brought there from Stalag -3B. I recognized
them as some of the men tortured and accused by KRAUSE, .These prisoners
were isolated from the rest and I later saw them marched off to the camp
crematorium. They did not a.11 go at once, but in parties spread over
the year 1944. I did not see them again after that. ' I was told by other
prisoners that they had been killed and put in the crematorluin. lifter
seeing the prisoners marched to the crematorium I saw the 3. S. guards return
without them. I do not know who was the Camp. Commandant of Sachsenhausen
but one of those reponsible for these atrocities was the Camp Leader
S.S. HaupsturmHuhrer KOLB who I would describe as aged about 45-50 years,
height 5 ft 9 ins., broad build and brown hair.
On Wednesday and Criday of each vreek about 10 to 13 prisoners were
called on parade at Sachsenhausen.	I saw these parades frequently.
Before being marched away their teeth were examined by an 3. S. dentist
and gold teeth and' gold fillings were noted. Then the prisoners were
marched away out of thq caap and,I never,saw them again. I was told by
certain prisoners .who had witnessed the incidents that they were shot
and after death their gold teeth and fillings removed.
I worked as a Doctor in the Camp Hospital. Hospital 2, Room 51,
was reserved for experimental work. -Seven or eight Jewish boys aged
between 8 and 19 years who had been brought from Auschwitz were kept .
in this room. A Wehmaoht doctor whose name I do not know came to see
these boys "oeriodically. He was about 40-45 years ox age, height 5
9-10 ins., medium build and short blonde hair. The Jewish boys were all
perfectly healthy when they arrived at the camp. When the doctoral have
described visited the camp he gave them injections. I was told this by
a young prisoner who had cleaned that broom. Then the patients were ill
for a time with high temperatures. When I lefft the camp these Jewish ooys
were still there still being experimented on. Another' room apparently
used for experimental injections was a room of the Hospital A.5 B.
was told by a number of prisoners that patients in that room received ^	«
injections which made them very ill but I heard of no deaths. ^ I myselx
was not allowed in this room. The doctors who practised in there ana
are alleged to have given experimental injections axe :- 3.3. Doctor
Hauptsturmfuhfer H0RSTMAHN, aged 30-35 years, height 5xt 9;il1's» j ^s-Lim build,
blonde hair and wears glasses. S.S. Doctor Unterstumfuhrer GiJJERIiE, aged
about 40 years, 5 ft 9 ins. , slim build, dark hair 'and eyes. This man
is a Sudeten German and speaks Czech.
When new arrivals came to the .Camp sometimes all of them were marched
off toward the crematorium and at other times only part of them were sen*,
there. I saw this happen frequently. On one occasion I remember seeing
64 -orisoners arrive. They had .come from Stalag 3B and I recognised many
of them. 22 of the prisoners, including 8 doctors whom I knew personally,
were separated from the rest and marched off toward the crematorium. Aa
on other occasions I did not see those who went to the crematorium again.
There was a factory near the crematorium and workers from there who were also
-orisoners told me that they had all bee killed. Prisoners arriving from
Stalap 3B were accompanied by a list from whica their particulars were read
on arriving at Sachsenhausen. Though I am not in a position to prove 1
I firmly/.﻿-2-
finaly 'believe that the list was prepared hy KRiiUSE and gave some
indication of those he suspected as Jews etc. There is no doubt
in my mind that whatever was said on the list decided the fate of the
prisoners.
At Sachsenhausen there was a German prisoner named E3NET SIEGEL
who acted as an interpreter. He was about 36 years of age, height 6ft l-2ins.
stout build, blonde hair, round face, red complexion, grey eyes and
athletic appearance. At the. beginning of . rebruary 1945 at the time •
when the Russian armies were on the river Oder about 80 Russian prisoners
of war were called out on parade. I heard that they were paraded in the
camp and that SIEGEL was present. He was dressed as an S.S. man in uniform.
He told these 80 prisoner's that Germany needed educated persons for key ■
positions and that they had been selected. They were then taken, to Block 58.
This was about 10 o'clock at night. About 'half an hour later these
prisoners were marched out of the camp and I never saw them again. Shortly
afterwards I heard shooting outside the camp and I was told by other prisoners
that the'80 men had attempted to escape because they were going to the

of war (about six or seven other ranks), about 30 Luxemburgers, French and
"Russian prisoners, were marched out of the camp. At about 'n. a.,xn., i heard
more shooting and I \ms told later by other prisoners that these 96 men
had also been shot. The 96 prisoners included a number of my friends
and I have not seen any of them since that night. When I first arrived at
Sachsenhausen there were eight or nine British soldiers there who rolo.
me they had been captured at ITarvik in Norway. One of them I knew oy^name

and every day testing' the vsearing qualities of German boots. Six or seven
of them were among those killed when the 96 prisoners were marched from the
camp. The other two British soldiers, including MAJOR, came to Belsen wifn
me. Included in the 96 prisoners that were shot that night were the
following Russian prisoners all of whom I knew:-

•
sworn before Major S.G. CliiilviPIOlT, R.A. Legal Staff, I'To.l iar Grimes
Investigation Team on 2 Jun 45.
V/hen I arrived at Sachsenhausen I was told by Russian prisoners
of war there that many thousands of their number, all Russian prisoners of war,
had already been killed or had died of starvation in the camp. There were
seven or eight British prisoners of war at this camp and they told me they had.
been captured in Norway, during one of the raids made on Norway by British
forfies. At the camp they were dressed in civilian clothes having been deprived
of their uniforms by the Germans. I knew one of them by the name or MAJOR.
These British soldiers were made to run round the caiip all day and every day
often carrying heavy packs on their-backs. This was done to test the quality
and wearing of German boots. The men covered 42 kilometres daily. At the^
camp at' this time were also a number of Norwegian prisoners who told me that
they had been in prison for attempting to escape to England from Norway. The
Norwegian prisoners were able to get mail, Red Cross parcels etc. ana British
battle-dress which they sore was also sent to them. The Brutish soldiers
were not allowed any such privileges and nor were most of the other prisoners.
The Norwegian prisoners therefore helped the British soldiers to sustain
themselves by sharing their Red Cross parcels with them. Jithout that extra
food the British soldiers could not have stood the strain of running each day,.
The S.*S. discovered what was happening and then foifea&e the sharing or Red
Cross parcels.
I remember that one day about the beginning of February 1945, just
before I was moved to Belsen, many prisoners were shot. 8p Russian prisoners
were called for at about 10 o'clock at night, they were taxen out oi the
camp and shot by the S.S. Later the same night a further 9f prisoners including
all the" British soldiers except two, Russian and french prisoners, were also
taken out and shot by the S.S. ' "I ’was told this by the air raid warden for
the camp, a prisoner named'MASCIffiS, who said that he accompanied the men to
the gate; At the time of these atrocities the Camp Commandant was:-
S.S. StunriSuhrer KEBEDL, aged now about 45 years, 1.70.metres
height, medium build.
As Camp Commandant he was responsible for orders and was’ therefore
responsible for the shooting, though I do not know who actually shot the
prisoners. Of the two British soldiers who escaped the shooting, one was
in. Hospital at the time, and. the other, known to me as,jlAJOR^. was m a
different part of the camp. They may have been overlooked. I never saw the
other British soldiers again.
The two British soldiers I have just mentioned came to BELSEN with me.
One of them moved on and I was told he went tb, Stettin. MAJOR who was ill with
typh .sstayed behind. One night shortly before Britisn troops entered cne
camp MAJOR was taken from his bed and carried away oil a stretcher. 1 was •
informed of this immediately by another prisoner. MAJOR was a popular man with
all those who knew him and everyone knew at once that he had been taken out.
I never saw MAJOR again after that and according to what I was told by many
other prisoners he was shot dead that same night by S.S. man El-lSRICH ana his
body was taken straight to the crematorium. ' I did not seq him killed.﻿EJCLmOT of statement made 'oj

inis is a c mp fer pelitio 1 priseners, criminals and civilian
internees. Shere ere peeple frem all the fennerly eccupied
oeuntries, including many Jews frem Hungary, Hell md and Peland.
fhe criminals are mainly (Jerman and there are a few German
pelitical prisoners. They did net send SUrweglans er preminent peepl
here, as peeple were snlv sent te die er put te death. The
Serwegicns were leeked afte* by the Swedish Bed Cress whe prerented
much ill treatment. Our Dutch led Cress efficials were laeis
.and did n»thing. leperts did net get threugh.
j£r mer has been cemmandant ever since I arrived.
There were 4.6.000 prisoners in the camp when I arrived.
The daily ratlen ef f«ed in my part ef the camp was 1500 grams
»£ bread between six persens and 3 pints ef seup fer each persern.
The chief ®f the bleck generally issued 180 grams ef bread and
2 pints ef seup made frem reets such as turnips fer each persen
ret iaing the rest. The full rntien was issued by the ceekheuse.
W# were at th t time 1000 in the larger buildings and 500 in the
siftjftll. This made it necessary’ ftr three persena te sleep in each
bed.
The enlv medical aid we had was frem priseners whe were decters
•r nurses. The capacity ef the hespital in the men’s camp was
200 - 300 persens. There were in January abent 2 2 te 3 theuaana
sick. There were ne medical supplies previded. The water fllewed
pel' day fer the typhus cases was 200 litres fer them all. There
were 1200 persens' suffering frem typhus.
Twenty-five percent ef the priseners died each menth. That is
abeut 4000 deaths each week. When I gfirst came, the bedies were
burnt in th® crematerium. At the time ef my arrival there were n
1700 cerpses waiting dispesal eutside the
increased te 4000 and they started ts bury them. Iheybe*ante
be left abfeut the camp. It was especially bad ih the week befere
the British came.
As leng as peeple slept in their nermalbarracks.they had t.
be breught .ut fer cunting eace er twice e.oh day. I. they
c»uld net walk, they were dragged eut by the ethers.
We never had enough water t# wash er t® deal with eur excrements.
They made us -erk 12 er U hours a day. There was an iaterva! f®r
lunch each day, but we seldem get the slice ef bre^d	.
suppesed te have. The respite was fer the benefit ef the *Uc.ras
whe ceuld net make us w4rk all the time.
We saw men beaten te death every day. The peeple were se hungry
that they stele petatees when *t werk in the fi«1
back they were searched and these feund with apetatee were ;,iven
-five strikes with a cat ®r a heavy stick. The beating was
generally applied t# the kidneys sptd they either died immediately

ramained tlierc until ID Depteifcer 194V. I have never witnessal any
aiocutione nor liaro I noticed ca\; other irregularities in tliis ciiiup; on
the omtiaxy it mis clean and 1 thought it was well run.
On tho 10th aeptenfecr 134V we got the order to evacuate that oaop.
I packed ctoat I oould of tto emtoen goods and loaded it all on a railway track
with which I wont to the Concentration Ota© in BSCiSM.

1945 daring .which period I had to repost tlirea ttaes to Stbf* BOKGETA at the
ahovenaaed office .In Orcaieiibm'g,
Up till then I belonged to the staff of the W - V.W.U.A. In January 1345s
however, I was transferred to the adrainistrativo staff of	Osh©. Krota
%
the 15th January 1345 owmrvis I was employed in the %*arter |aster’ a Stores.
I was in cliar:;® of olotliing for the prisoners and another 3.3. b.0,0,
(Unterscb-arfuiisrer CAfSGHfflSIS).
I ;;or|£od fe the QK Stores till m ibb 45 at ..nidi nato 1 took a
"coneigwmt" of prisoners to BRS3LHEI and spent two days at hotao* Durlat; these
two/,....﻿t .O days our house viraa botabed and I did ©t return till 22 Ml 45.
On sqy return I v/as told that I had. to Oicoontinue i-jy job in the stores.

peiE&tted the p*4oon®rs to cook it in tlie stores

I have never seen anybody killed, neither by diooting nor haogteg, nor have

The prisoner was tall and broad shouldered and wore dark trousers and
a dark long ooatj I cannot tell whether it vms a civilian suit or a uaifora.
On liis head he had a dark cep, I think it was dark blue and it was what its
describe as a sailor*® cap*
I cannot give miy maK9 details as it was pretty dark and I could not
see Ills face. We then returned to the guard room with the prisoner,
the only piece of conversation on the way which I can ransuber was scoetliiag
about the prisoner being trsasferred to another oaop* I was surprised that
tills should take place at tiiat unusual hour of tl» night. &im m left

that wo can go iioms”. After that WM end WMmmi disarspaearod and after a
short while I heard a shot. to their return KIdB:j asked "Is it done" and.
they replied- :xes it’s dono*. I am not sure of that, however, it is
possible they cay have said straight away "All rlfjit it’s dene". Then \to

He that an order had arrived that doy from BSHUBT ordering the execution
of that prisoner who was believed to have been a Russian Ocffilosax.
He then showed a© blood stains on his trousers aikl 1 gave lisa soae hot water to
remove tliesa. I took it that ihtae blood-ataias oeao from the a:ooutia» of the
prisoner but I did not ask him.
I never enquired whether tills was a rightful execution or not, tho
fact that the order was given by tho R»d*li.A* Berlin satisfied rae cocpletoly

STATEMENT
Pinn MOLVIG
Linstowsgate 4> OSLO
Clerk
Born 21/2/22
I came from SACHSEMiAUSEN concentration camp to EELSEN
concentration camp on the 11th of February 1945*
Here I met an English soldier, Keith MAYOR, who had
arrived at the camp a few days before me, also from SACHSENHAUSEN.
Keith MAYOR stayed in BELSSN the whole time I was there, for five
weeks, and he was quite all right when I left. I cannot remember
the exact date.
Some days after I arrived at BEI£EN there came another
British soldier, Alfred ROE, who was nicknamed 'Tubby*. He also came
from SACHSENHAUSEN. I did not see him myself but I heard from good
Norwegian friends that he was there.
This is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the
truth.

I have never been a member of a political party, also not of the NSDAP.
I only was a member of the ArBeitsfront.
In May 1944 I was called tot the ranks. (I have been in de first world-
war 1917-18. )My unit was Landesschutz at Pruisisch Holland.I was there Oberfeld-
webel.Because I was unfit for the service in the field they told me and °th®rs
of m age that I was incorporated in the SS.My rank there ms Hauptscharfueh-
rer.On 20-7-44.1 was consigned to the Concentrationcamp at V U G H T (Holland?
I was charged there with the administration (bookkeeping)of the cantfasn until
10-9-44.1 did not know any prisoner.I remember that in the S3 canteen a Belgian
with the name Jo was a servant. There was also a Dutchman of whom I d°n't
her the name. I only know, that he was a farmer in the neighbourhood of E IN Ji-
ll 0 V E N .1 do not know anything of cruelties.When I was there I heard ri I
reports and I know from posters am the camp that people have been shot,but 1
have never seen the shooting.Whether these people were innocent I never rea-
lised,becouse I thought and I had to assume,that when people were shot,they
would have been tried in accordance with the law,for committing crimes,wich
with a view to the war,were punished with death.	„ IT m -n r p
I was not allowed in the compounds of . the camp. A certain HUAI i 1 ^
was then oommandant of the camp.	..	_	.	.	-
I knew hardly ana other German.The only man,with whom I came in touch ra-
ther frequently was Hauptscharfueh*rer R A UN. He was in charge of the sales
of the canteen.He was also a compulsery member of the SS,like me.
On 10-9-44 the order was given to pack.We then went away with 19 railway-
wagons to Germany. In my wagon were 4 other men; Hptschf. R A U Oberschf.
DISK MANN jUnterschf.S E T Z E R und 0b ersturmbamif uhrer Dr.F ISO H-E K ,
the camp-doctor. The latter left the train inNIJMEGEN.
I don't know anything about this people.I did not know then before^I came
into the camp and I had not the opportunity to watch them while at work. .
In the beginning of October I arrived at B E L S E N .First I was not in
the compound of the camp but in the officerbuildLngs. I was in charge there
with the distribution of the stuff we brought with us from V U G H T, among
6 camps.I did this job until 15-1-45.It took such a long time because of the
traFi^ri^1-45Cimtil37-2-45 I have been in charge of the clothes-store.After
I had gone on leave on 7-2-45 I was dismissed from the clothes-store,because
I had been to friendly with the prisonens.	,	,	, ^	^
I was then put at the disposal of the chief-guard,who bad no employment for
me.because he had hid own men whom he had brought with him from A U S C H
W I T Z .So I did verry little.Only in the last week of the capture or tne
camp I have been Arbeitsfuehrer (Labour leader).
I never heard anything about gas-chambers.I know and I have seen that pri-
soners, among whom ill onesjhave been fiercely beaten.I caanot say whether among
these prisoners were sane Dutchmen.	_ . .	. , .
About KRAMER I have nothing else to say «.han that he arrived in the
beginning of December 1944. He came from AUSCHWITZ and °ro^tt^S °^
mi with him. To my opinion KRAMER cannot be held responsible for the over-
population of the camp.This had accommodationforeOQOpeopieand notfor
44000.1 know that K R A M E R had wired to and had telfonecalls with BERLIN,
to ask not to send more prisoners to the camp.	....
I will not defend KRAMER and I will assume that he, although he acted
on orders, camnitted atrocities. The organisation of the camp was bigKLy ineffi-
cient of course. E.g.not all the boilers to prepare food were used.The conse-
oiSe was that the distribution of the hot food started in the morning and
ended at night.In the beginning (December)the nourishment was net so bad later-
on however it became worse and worse as a consequence of the overpopulation
and the transportdifficulties.Of course,it was horrible to see the prisoners
starve and be ill-treated,but we could not do anything to alter the situation.
The names of the people who have the prisoners fiercely beaten,are;
Rottenfuehrer FINK (originating from RUMANIA)
Blokfuehrer Unterscharfuebrer M U L L E R (to be well distinguished
from MULLER of the stores.)﻿SECRET.
Unterscharfuehrer HAMER.
I don't know the surnames of these men.These people and more of the SS-men
1 w«*came from AUSCHWITZ fled before the capture of the camps. About their
present whereabouts I do know nothing.It is quite possible that they hide them-
selves as P.O.W.'s in P.O.W, camps.
The Dutch men(prisoners)whom I know,are:
Barrister M A R X and his wiffeThev were Jews with a Palestine certici-
cate. Both have been forwarded toTHERESIENSTADT although Mrs.
MARX was ill at that time.The transport toTHERESIENSTADT
has been heavily fired at in the neighbourhoud of C E L L E .1 don't know,
whether this people still live.I would Mr.M A R X was still alive,he than
could state that I have behaved nyself always decently to the prisoners.
Miss T R U D E .also a Jewess of whom I don't know the surname,She was
a verry nice girl.She was said to have been in her girlhood a friend of the
Princess Juliana.
JACK Kapo in the Campstore.Also his surname I cant remember.
In the store people who worked there were nearly all Dutch (+ 15).I don't
know their names. When names and incidents come back to my mind I will,write
them on the list wich Capt.Stwfcrt ordered me to compose.
I don't know why I have been sent to this camp.I have done nothing.Proba-
bly someone atEDDELAK has betrayed me saying that I have been a member
of the SS.At present I am accused of having murdered an Englishman who was in
B E L S E N .Probably the Oberscharfuehrer EMMERICH has said that I mur-
dered the man. I did not do it. There are 3 men only who could have done it. One
of them is EMM ERICH ,for he and another man went away with the Englishman.
If they only would confront me with EMMERICH it would be absolutely
clear that I could not have done it."
GENERAL IMPRESSION.;This man is dull;a weak character who is probably
not able to commit any atrocitie,but also would not oppose to cruelties"when
committed in his presence.A real German.I don't believe that this man knew more
than he said at the time of the interrogation.He is verry much afraid that it
cannot be proved that he is unguilty of the murder of the Englishman.﻿u O	^

1.	I am 27 years old and have been in Concentration Camps since October
1942.My only crime was being a Jew. My husband died in a Concentration Camp
with me on 10th January 1944. I came to Belsen about January 1945-
2.	All the time I have been at Belsen I have been what is known as a
Block Chief. There were sometimes as many as a thousand women in a block.
3.	A woman called Milhan whose married name was Volkenrath came to Belsen
17. 3/M. fLabieit) as	oberaufseherin, that is used head of the women's section at Belsen. She
had held that position at Auschwitz.
4.	She frequently used to come to my block and take away our cigarettes,
clothes and bread and other food.
5.	It was a habit of hers to get girls to go to her house or office where
the women chiefs lived and compel them to 'make sport'(Sport machen). Ihis
meant exercises and took the form of making the girls run round fast and fall
down, get up again and repeat the process. This lasted from half an hour to
ON HIS	"	. „
-------an hour. I myself was made to do this three times in March 1945 for no reason

6.	There was in the Camp a girl we knew as Stenia who was a prisoner and
acted as Chief of the Camp among the prisoners. She was friendly with all the
S.S. women and especially with Volkenrath. She was, I think, about 27 years
of age, although it is difficult to tell ages in Camp, very tall, slender and
dark haired. She was suffering, I think, from T.B. About the beginning of
April she drank something that made her ill but said that she had been poisoned
by cakes sent from the kitchen. As a result the chief woman cook, her sister
and a kitchen hand were shot. They disappeared and their dresses were sent
back to their room which was the custom when women were shot.
7.	The chief of the kitchen at No. 1 Camp was a man whose name, I think,
was Traur. In the last week before the English came I saw three women ask
him for drinking water which was very short in the Camp. They were in a very

1.	I am 21 years old. I am a Jewess of Czecho-Slovakian nationality.
"33IAH3S 1
I was arrested by the Germans in March 1944 and taken to AUSCHWITZ camp.
In February 1945 I was transferred to Belsen camp and I was employed in the
kitchen. I had been employed in the kitchen at AUCHWTTZ and did not sleep
with the ordinary prisoners. I saw persons put in the gas chamber but by
being in the kitchen I escaped the beatings and the starvation which the
other prisoners endured.
2.	About seven weeks ago the SS. women ELLERS noticed a ring and a locket
I was wearing. I had previously hidden these. She took them from me and
took me into her room where she made me undress. She questioned me as to
where I had got this jewellery but did not believe me when I said it was
r lw. w«., mine and I had brought it with me to HELSEN. She beat me with a stick about
the head and back until blood came from nose and eyes. I then dressed
and was ne.de to run behind the bicyde ridden by ELLERS to the SS headquarters.
Whilst I was being interrogated by ELLERS two other SS women were present
and took part in the beating. Their names are GGLLA3CH and VOLGENRAT.
I was questioned in the presence of these three women by two SS wmen
whose names I do not know but whom I could recognise. They beat me about
the shoulders with a rubber truncheon. I was then put in a cellar xn a
house by nyaelf and only given bread and water every three days. My sister
managed to smuggle extra food to me. After three weeks and daily
questioning I was taken out and made to work in the Latrines, ^ter six
days I caught Typhus and I was in hospital when the camp was liberated.

1.	I am 21 years old. I am a Jewess of Austrian nationality. After being
expelled, from Vienna and taking refuge in Prance I was handed over to the
Genaans in 1940 and I have been a prisoner since that date until AELanh cai®
was liberated.
2.	I came to BELSEN camp in November 1944* It is divided into three parts.
Carro 1. was for prisoners, Carcps 2 and 3 for the prison staff.
3.	Every day at the camp a roll call was made under the command of the S.b.
women warders. All women, including the sick, had to stand in the open for
an hour and sometimes longer. I, myself, had typhus three tines and notwith-
standing this was forced to attend these roll calls. If any person novea
she was struck by one of the SS women with a stick . The result of this
treatment combined with insufficient clothing and food was that the great
;<AIS3fVW mjority of woroen died after a few months. Thus, I arrived with a party
of 3000 and only 20 of my party are now alive.
^ The women 33 warders selected workers for work which included the carrying
of big logs of wood. Women were selected irrespective of their health ^
they were flogged if they faltered in their work.
5. The women were housed in huts and overcrowded. If they were not working
they were not allowed to leave the block for ary purpose whatsoever and were
beaten by the women warders if they did so. There was nn sanitary
accommodation in the blocksrfratsoever, there were no blankets issued. There
was no heat. A oup of tepid Ers^ coffee was supplied in the morning and

the only other meal was a cup of thin vegetable soup and a piece of breaB
6. During the three ^prior to the liberation of the camp we only ha
half a pint of turnip aoup once a day. We had no bread. Before this

of the Hospital there. One day T fiacTpaihs and couM riot stand UpfTgHt so sfie
beat me so severely that I was in Hospital for three weeks.
3i At Auschwitz in December 1942 I had a French girl-friend whose mother was
selected for the gas chamber. My friend asked to go too but Elnmerich said
"You are healthy." He then, however, proceeded to beat her so that she became
ill and he sent her also to the gas chamber.
4.	At Auschwitz an S.S. woman whan I identify as Bormann (photo 19-3) used
to be in charge of women prisoners working outside the Camp. She used to have
a large dog (? wolfhound) which she used to set on the women if they became
weak and unable to work properly. Many of them were taken to Hospital and died
01 blood-poisoning. Hany others were sent to Block No. 25 which always meant that
they went-to the gas chamber.

cook whom I identify as Jenner (photo 24-4) deliberately fire a rifle from the
road into the windows of a living block (No. 222) and shoot dead a Hungarian
nurse called Anna Kis, aged about 30 years. She had done nothing and the only

198 block. At first there were about 400 women in this block who as they were those in
the best health worked in making equipment for the German Army. Later about 800
persons were housed in this block and gradually deaths increased. I estimate that some
300 persons died whilst I was block leader from starvation and typhus. There was no

internees were persons who were unable to work and they stayed only a few days in the
block before being sent to the gas chamber. I helped ANNA STERN as block leader
We were so employed for about a year and during this time I calculate that over 25000
people passed through this block’ to the gas chamber. In fact the block was used
for four months out of the year for housing sick persons and not as a prison prior to
the gas chamber. I nanaged to assist a certain number to escape and was nyself detailed

(photo 22 - 6) was first of all a prison wardress in that camp for about a year
I was told that she had beaten three women to death there.
4.	A woman called MANUEL was first of all chief of the prison block at
Ravensbruck and later of the camp. I was myself in the camp for about eleven
months frequently saw women beaten over a period of two or three days.
They were then taken to Hospital and if they did not die they wqye given an

of the Staff of the Judge Advocate General to the Forces,
1.	I am aged 23 and am a Jewess of G zecho-Slovakian nationality.
I	^irn Sudetenland in September 1938 aad went to Czecho-Slovakia. I
was arrested by the Germans in Prague and on 23rd. October 1941 was sent to the
Ghetto in Poland. Ly mother and baby sister were gassed <S«i:e -&hefc*o and I
with the rest of the family was transferred to Auschwitz. In August 1944 njy
father having been gassed at AUSCHWITZ I and my sister were transferred to 3HL3EK
Concentration Camp.
2,	At AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp there'was a Doctor named LHLGELE.
When ny draft arrived at the camp we were made to parade in front of him. ::e
sorted out the fit ones and all others, old people, sick people, pregnant women,
and every child were sent straight to the gas chamber. The rest after having their
hair shaved and being washed were examined naked and further selectidns were made
# for the gas chamber. From then on similar examination took place every few days.
Any person with visible sigiyk of illness, disease or anything else was sent
straight to the gas chamber. A woman named DHEXLER also took part in making these
selections.
%	X was one of the first batch of a thousand girls to arrive at
BELSEN. Previously only mle prisoners were kePt at BELSSH. I was employed as
a clerk and it was ny duty to record the number of deaths of women in the camp each
day. In the first few weeks the figures were low. As more internees arrived
deaths increased. In Januaiy, 15 to 20 died daily. From then on deaths increased
until the last day of March on which day the number of deaths reported was
three hundred aid forty nine. This figure was not accurate since all deaths wei*
not reported and bodies uncounted were lying in the open. In April the daily
dealbs increased but I can give no figures as I then went ill with typhus.﻿•• -2-

4 hours the girl could no longer hold her arms up and this S3 woman went to her and
beat her on the head, back and legs with a rubber stick. The girl was not unconscious
and no one was allowed to assist her. She lay there until nightfall and and I do not
know what happened to her afterwards. I would add that I have seen this 33 woman
often beating sick girls usually when "Appelle" was on and on one occasion in March
I was struck across the face again and again with a rubber stick for havin, iqy coat open,
another occasion I saw her striking a girl on the groudd with a stick and kicking her.

guilty of great cruelty. When she was on "4pelle" duty she always made it last as long
^possible and often it lasted from 6 am until noon. Sick and dying women-were forced
to attend and many of them collapsed.

the ages of 15 and 20 were subjected to experimental operations.

I myself assisted in the escape of Sjt.Bomber Jonnie Dix, RAF, and his Pilot Officer
whom I only knew as Jim. I also assisted in the escape of an American Officer

identify as No. 4 on photograph 12, kick very severely a Polish woman who was too
weak to walk to the latrine. This happened outside a block and the woman was
left lying on the ground. I do not know if she died but I never saw her again.
i also name SS woman BINNS who was in charge of the woman's camp
at RAVENSBHDCK as responsible for many deaths by beatings. I was told by
prisoners who had been there for several years that this woman had herself shot
and ordered the shooting of prisoners though I have no personal knowledge ad to
this.
She was also responsible for the very brutal punishment of women
who attenpted to escape. Thus, such women were stripped, beaten with ruboer clubs,
had their two front teeth knocked out and their hair cut off. The women always
had to be taken to hospital. In addition the whole block would be punished by
being kept on parade from 4 to 6 hours and on one occasion for as long as 14 ho rs.

DEPOSITION OP MISS LIDIA SUNSCHEIN, Polish, late of Lodz, sworn before me
Major Geoffrey Smallwood, Major (Legal Staff) Judge Advocate General's Office.
1.	I am 24 years of age and was first arrested in September 1939 as a
political prisoner. I was released after a year and re-arrested on 11th
November 1942 as a Jew. I was in Auschwitz for a time with my mother and
brother. They were both sent to the gas chamber there. I came to Belsen
on 3rd January 1945.	u- .
2.	I know WEINGARTNER (photo 12 - l).	At Auschwitz he was Bloekfuhrer
of my work party of which I was foreman.	He made me beat people there and
when I didn't want to and protested he put me into another Koramando where the
work was so hard that I got T.B.	t »
*4	v
3.	He was also employed at Belsen	where I was employed as
kitchen foreman. The prisoners always wanted to get anployed in the kitchen
because they got extra food and one day there was a clamour by many of the
people to get taken on the kitchen staff. WEINGARTNER fired a shot in the
air with his rifle and I said that I did not want to remain working there but
would go back to the block. He said that was sabotage and proceeded to give
me 15 strokes on the head with a rubber truncheon. I was a week in Hospital
and it affected my heart and I am still ill.
4.	On the same day that he beat me he beat another girl on the arms with a
stick so that they became swollen.
5.	Although he was sometimes violent himself he more often forced his
prisoner leaders to beat the other prisoners. He was a very hard taskmaster
#
and one time in the winter’ he made women repair river banks for very long
hours at the time standing up to their knees in water. At one time he had
as many as 1,000 women under him.
6.	At BefeB^Hae^liad about 20 dogs which he used to set on the prisoners
from time to time.
7.	I also knew HERTZOG (photo 12 - 4) . He was one of the cruellest of the
S.S. and used to carry a large stick. He was one of those in charge of the
water arrangements at Belsen. Every day he used to beat men and women so
badly that they mist have died. He often used to beat the girls from tre
kitchen. On one Kfk occasion he knocked two mens' heads against a wall
8/ s﻿-2-
8. I knew an S.S. woman at Belsen called Frau AMFER.	She was tliere for
about six weeks in March and April 1945. Her description is: age about 40
years, blue eyes, nose a little to one side, fat and tall, blonde with some
grey in her hair and a Hitler fanatic. For the slightest reasons she used
to beat men and women with a rubber tube or stick.* She used to taken them
into a small room in the kitchen ancj beat them until they fainted. Two of
them whom she beat were called Rosa Agrest and Bela Rrancke. >~>he was very
friendly with HEUSKEL (photo 9-2) who also was very cruel and was always
*
beating people.

DEPOSITION OP RAYMOND DUJEU, late of PARIS, sworn before me. Major Geoffrey
Smallwood, Major (Legal Staff) , an Officer of the Staff of the Judge Advocate
*
General to the Forces.
*
1.
I am 22 years of age. I was sent for forced labour in 1942. I was
arrested in April 1942 for returning to France without permission. On 1st. May
1942 I came to BELSEN. At that time they? were	200 Russians in the
*	A
camp. I have worked in the kitchen all the time I have been at BELSEN.
2.	I knew THEODORE HEUSKEL (Photo 9 - 2 ). He was a very cruel member of
the SS. At the beginning of April 1945 there was a crowd of people trying to
force their way into the kitchen to get potatoes. He shot six of them dead in
my presence.
3.	On one occasion he forced me to take a woman and hold her down between
Try legs while he gave her 15 strokes with a rubber tube/ she was between 25 and
30 years of age.
4.	Every day he used to give men beatings, up to 25 strokes if he caught
them taking potatoes and he used to take women by their hair and knock their heads
against a wall.	(	’
5.	I also knew FREDERICK HERZOG (Photo).2 -4). I think that he was the
worst of the lot. On one occasion I had wet feet and no socks so I took a
handkerchief and tore it in half and bound the halfs round my feet. A German
saw this and reported it so HERZOG made me bend down with my head between a
Germans legs and he gave me 25 strokes with a thick stick; it was terrible.
6.	Some two years ago some Russians escaped from the camp. HERZOG
tried to get information from some of their friends who stayed behind but failed
to get what he wanted. I saw him take four of these Russians behind the
crematorium and I saw him come back alone. I never waw tfiese Russians again
and I am certain he must have shot them.

7•	On the day that the English came, 15th. April 1945» there wer^ some
women in the kitchen who had come to take their fcoup and one of them took a

with a piece of wood that was lying nearby.
8.	I knew SHMIBZT OSKAR (Ehoto 7 - 2), and although I never myself saw him
beat anyone my friends have told me that he often beat them.
9.	I also knew an SS man called KARL ELRAZICH( Hub to l-5)He was an exception
to the ordinary guards and was always kind and never beat anyone.
10.	I also wish to mention an SS woman who was working in the kitchen
for three weeks before the English came. I have been given a description of a
woman who is in an hospital at Schwarmstedt,**her name is Gisella Koblischek
* .
and her description corresponds to an SS woman I knew and she was always kind
to everyone.

IN THE MATTER OF ’.VAR CRIMES
AND
THE GAS CHAMBER AT AUSCHi/ITZ
I'URTHER DEPOSITION OF ADA BIMKD (Female) late of SoanovrLtz, Poland, sworn
before Captain ALBRED JA1.IES FOX, General List, D.A.P.M. 86 Special Investigatic
Section, Corps of Military Police.
1.	In the Berkenau section of Auschwitz camp there were five brick
buildings. These five buildings were similar in appearance and ftifferent
from all other buildings in the camp. They were commonly known by all the
prisoners in the camp an crematoriums. When selections were held I saw the
condemned persons driven to these buildings in lorries. I did not see the
persons actually enter the buildings and it was not possible to get sufficiently
close to do &o. Both men and women were in the parties taken to these
buildings. Usually the eondemned women were ordered to undress and leave
their clothes behind in Block 25, and sometimes they undressed at the gas
chamber. Occasionally they were allowed to take blankets with them to
the gas chamber, but this was all according to the S. S. man in charge.
Hospital blankets were used for this purpose. The crematoriums and gas
chambers were in an area of the caup known as BRZSZINKI.
2.	One day in August 19V)- I was able to visit one of these buildings.
The visit was pre-arranged with an SS Unterscharfuhrer (name unknown) who
belonged to the medical staff and who agreed to show me round.	I met him
near the building. We agreed to say that our visit was in order to fetch
blankets if anyone stopped us. The S. 3. man took me in a door of the
building and inside we met a Polish prisoner named Josef Goldberg. I
know this man1 s name because he carries from my heme town. He was enroloyed in
this building. I do not know his present whereabouts. The door through
which we entered the building led into what appeared to be an undressing room.
There were hooka on the wall and the S. S. man told me that it was an undressing
room. This was on the ground floor. From this room there was another
door. We walked through this door which led us into another room which had
the appearance of a ahowerbath room. I noticed that there were five or six
rows o^ spray*fittings in the roof, with about twenty sprays to each row.﻿The room was about 4-8 ft.
The' floor, walls and ceiling were made of concrete,
square and 10 ft. high. One thing I noticed was that there were no
drains, so that if water came through the sprays it couM not drain away,
i'he floor being on the same level as other rooms this would mean that water
would flood right through the building. The S.S. man told me that this room
was the gas chamber,
3#	waiving through the gas chamber room we went through another
door which led into a passage pointing directly ahead. It was rather dark
in there at the time and I could not see the far end of the passage. There
were two rails leading from the door of the gas chamber down the passage and
on these rails was a flat-topped waggon. The S.S. man told me that the
waggon was used to take the dead bodies from the gas chamber to the crematorium
at the other end of the passage.
4^	We then walked back through the gas chamber and undressing-room
to the door where I had entered the building. Near this door were some stairs,
y/e went up these stairs and came to a room above the gas chamber. Across this
room were two pipes each about three inches thick. I did not notice whether
there were any branch pipes leadingflrom them. The S.S. man told me that the
pipes, which were on the floor, were connected to the spray fittings in the gas
chamber below. In a comer of the room were two large cylinders but I did not
notice whether these cylinders were connected to the pipes. The S.S. man told
me that the cylinders contained gas which passed through the pipes into the
gas chamber. I then left the room.
With reference to the gas chamber there were also hooks on the
walls in this room. The S.S. man told me that they were there to hang towels
on as condemned prisoners were led to believe that it was a shower room, and
were given towels to deceive them.

DEiOClTION OF i\NITA LUKKR of SR iJLAU, sworn before i.e Major P, Incresa Bell, an Officer
of the Stiff of the Judge Advocate General to the Forces,
1,	I am aged 19 and am a Jewess of German nationality, I was arrested in
%
September 1942 for being in possession of false identity papers which I had ho ed to
use to enable me to escape from Germany, I reirtfiined at Breslau prison until December 194-a
m +1 was transferred to AUSCHWITZ. I was finally transferred to BELSHN in Nov, 44,
«
2,	I was a member of the caiq? band at AUSOH.TTZ and the block in which I
lived was only about 50 yards from one of the crematoriums.
3,	I wish first to give a description of the mass murder of internees by a
gas chamber and by fire. When batches of internees arrived selections would be made
at the railway station of persons to be killed. Further selections were made in the cam
proper and at the hospital. I have frequently seen such selections made and whilst
women and children, particularly the siek,were first taken, indWaoriminrte selections
were Iso made in order presunably that the required nmabers should be exterminated,
p- « dead were burnt in the crematoriums of which there were several in the c j®.
4,	I recollect in particular the arrival of a number of Hungarian prisoners in
May 1944. The oamp could not aeco modate them end thousands were sent to the
crematoriums. Bven the crematoriums were insuflicent so large numb rs were thrown
into ditches in which fires were burning. I did not nyself see ;-ny living person go into
the fires but I did hear the cries and screams of children at night and I was told
frequently that maiy were burnt alive. This particular phase lasted from 5 to 6 weeks.
I Tftig in a position to witness many of these murders because I was a i cmber
of the band which played for the ,i3 and we were often utilised whilst the selections
of viotixa was being oa.xied out and todies being burnt in the crematoriums,
6#	Iri January 1944 I was in hospital suffering from typhus I was exon ted

1.	I am 3^ years of age and of Czecho-Slovakian nationality. I was a .
manufacturer in Prague and was arrested for failing to produce good and
sufficient quantities for the Germans. I was arrested December 1943 and
finally sent to DORA CAMP NOHDAUSEN on 11th. May 1944. This carp worked
underground making electrical parts for V weapons. The conditions were
very bad. The average Number of prisoners was 18,000 and whilst I was there
many died from starvation, beatings and overwork.. There was no water readily
available and the average day's food was one litre of soup, ^ffigms of bread
ard 20 grms of margarine. The Red Cross parcels of the French prisoners were
stolen on the orders of Franz HE3SLER. The prisoners only receiving the
biscuits. Most of the people at the camp were french.
2.	The responsible officers were the Commandant FEBSCHNER or FORSCHNER,
S3 MOSER and the said FRANZ HES3LER.
3.	On 4th. April 1945 10,000 workers were transferred to HELSEN.
The journey took about 5 days and over 100 died due to the conditions and a
number were shot on route. Attached to thetrain was an ambulance wagon
in which the sick were carried. There were still 9 of these/wien we arrived
at BERGEN station. Whilst I was there the S3 man HESSLER came up and gave
instructions that the 9 sick persons were to be shot. I did not see them
shot but I never saw them again.

1.	lam 1+0 years of age and I am of G zecho-olovakian nationality. I was
arrested by the Germans on 28th* April 1943 for refusing to go to work and after
* -■'•ng in scarious prisons and working camps, I was sent to KLEIN-BQDUI\1GEN about
iWw^
July 1944. On 9tb. April 1945 I v/as sent to Belsen.
2.	At^ the beginning of I,.arch 1945,	S3, man Rapportfuhrer WILHELL- DC2
1
whom I identify as No.6 on Photo 7 caught too prisoners hiding in the cellar
where potatoes were stored* He ordered three other prisoners to kill these two men
on promise of extra rations. The three prisoners in rry presence beat the too men
with pieces of wood on the heads until they died. The Doilies were ouried in the
\
factory grounds and I could point out the ourial place.
3.	0n April 5th. 1945 I was one of a party of about 650 prisoners of mixed
nationalities who set out to March to BELSEN. SS.man FRANZ STCI’EL whom I identity
as No.3 on photo 7 was in charge of the party, the second in charge was the said
SS man DOR. There were also about 40 other S3 men. The march lasted,! think,
until the 9th. April and we travelled through Herzberg, Braunschweg, peine and Celle
4.	On the evening of 5th. April near a stable somewhere between Herzberg
and Braunschweg I saw the said DOR shoot too of six men who had escaped from a
party of prisoners from Nordhaused. The bodies were buried near the stable .
5.	Next morning the said DOR shot the other four men and their bodies
were left underneath some straw in the stable.
DOR
6.	Prom that time onwards the said/began to shoot all stragglers. AH
the prisoners had been able to keep the pace for the first too days but by this
time some had trouble with their feet and were being given lifts in hand drawn
carta. Whenever the said DOR caught them doing so or straggling behind he shot
them usually just off the road, in a wood or apace and left the bodies were they
were shot. I cannot remember exact details of each individual sliboting but I saw﻿/
-2-
V	t*
him shoot at least IJo prisoners in all. The other 3S men did not take part in the
shooting nor did the said STOIEL though he did see DOR shoot the ■ytfi. soners and made
no objection. The only prisoner^ I can identify was a Frenchman named l-hhCELLI
who came from Paris.
7.	On arrival at Bergen station nine prisoners were caught in the act of
stealing swedes. One of the men shot was a Pole named Ladislav Stolpe. The 33
man was a Slovak, he was aged 22, 1.7 metres tall, medium build, long fair hair
brushed straight back, fresh complexion, broad nose and blue eyes.
8.	I calculate that some 65 men in all were killed during this march,
5 e«caped. If I was taken along the route I followed I think I could point out
the various places at which men were shot by DOR and where their bodies can oe found.

DEPOSITION OF KLARA LEBOWITS of GERTIS, CZECHOSLOVAKIA, sworn before me. Major P.
Ingress Bell, D.A.A.G., Legal Staff, an Officer of the Staff of the Judge Advocate
General to the Forces,
I am 31 years of age and a Jewess of Czecho-Slovakian nationality. I was
sent to AUSCHWITZ in April 194M and transferred to BEISEN on 4th, January 1945.
2,	I worked in the kitchen and though I was dismissed from "AHEELIS" after
a few minutes in order that I night go to work, Whilst working in the kitchen I could
see what happened at the "AEFELIS".
SS. woman GRESE was in charge of the "APFi'LIB" which took place twice a day
these lasted at least two hours and more often three or four hours. If a mistake was
in counting the internees they were made to stand until the missing one was iound
and this often meant all day. No time was allowed for food and people used to fall
unconscious as a result of this. When the woman GHESE attended these AgHELLS she
often made the internees go on their knees for hours on end or hold stones in their
hands high above their heads. If an internee did not stand upright because *e was
weak or for aitf other reason she would beat her with a rubber truncheon sometimes
until she was unconscious. She would kick persons lying on the ground and mary
people were taken to hospital as a result of her treatment. The internees were not
allowed to cany arything in their packets and the woman GHESE would often stop
aikl search internees whom she would beat unnercifully if she found anything
even a handkerchief.
4.	I have often seen the woman GRESE with Dr. 1'ENGSLE selecting people for the
gas chamber and for forced work in Germany. If the woman GRESE saw a mother and
dausht^- or sisters t^iAg to Bet tosether ir selection, for forced «>rk in Oen^ny

of 1942 when a fire broke out in one of the women's blocks and some of them smashed
a indaw in order to gst out of the block the said TAUBER arriving on the scene
shot three girls dead with a pistol and made the remainder kneel down outside the
block for the rest of the night. I was once detailed by him to keep those selected
for the gas chamber on parade separate from the other women until they were required.
I refused to do this and TAUBER wrote dorm ny name and told ne I would be hanged next
day. In fact I heard no more about it.
^	In July 1943 i saw 33 SHULZ beat a Polish girl named CECILIA

X.	I am 25 years of age, a Jewess of F0lish nationality . I was
arrested in November 1942 and after 8 days at SZEBINE Concentration Comp was transferred
to. AUSCHWITZ where I stayed until I was transferred to BELSEN on 18th# February 1945*

the persons responsible • I arrived at AUSCHWITZ in a batch of 1400 a 1000 of
which were sent straight to the gas chamber. I name S3 GEISLER as being responsible
for beating a girl with a stick for taking a potato when she was at work collecting
potatoes. The girl was in hospital for two weeks as a result of her injuries.
x name a^Jo S3. EITSH as a person who I saw frequently hitting and
beating women with a stick until he drew blood. He once beat me because I sto ped
a women hitting an elderly women.
.	At AUSCHWITZ I was found trying to take food to a sick friend
and S3, woman ELIZABETH VOLKANRATH whom I identify as no. 6. on photo 22 repeatedly
hit me and forced me to kneel outside iry hut for three hours.
Ju3t before the British troops arrived at BELSEN I saw
FREDERICK HERZOG whom I identify as No.4 on photo 12 take a girl to a special room
nake her bend down and beat her 25 times with a stick. T^is was because she had
taken a shoe from a vehicle.
6/﻿'pvro clays before the British Arrived I saw COHEK a Hungarian who
worked for the SS. and wore the S3, uniform shoot a man about 30 years old because
he tried to take a vegetable from near the cook house. He afterwards came into
the cook-house laughing. The man was killed. COHEK was 5 ft. 10 ins., veiy slim,
black hair, black eyes, sunken cheeks, large hands and ears, red face, full negroid

1.	Reveille in Belsen Canrp v/as at 4 o'clock in the morning, and the
. signal was given by means of a whistle. The healthy and the sick intdrnees had
to parade for roll-call and no one was exempted. The internees were counted by
the blockleaders and they in turn reported the numbers at the 3S blockleader's room.
This procedure lasted about 1 hour. After this, parties were detailed to fetch
breakfast from the various kitchens and this consisted of low grade coffee, one
cup being allowed for each internee. There was nothing to eat. Breakfast was
over at approximately 5.30 a.m. and was followed by a further roll-call in order
to ascertain the daily working strength. Each block had its own roll-call and
no one was allowed to remain in the block during such roll-call. There were,
nov/ever, special sick blocks, and the internees in these blocks were excused
from the parade.
2.	Internees ware grouped together in various working parties such as ;
wood collecting, weaving, road repairing, digging, vegetable' and coal konmando^,
orderlies for the SS Blocks, Room orderlies, tailoring, clothing store, kitchen and
food stores. Sonje of these parties were employed inside the camp arid some outside.
Work cormenced at 6 a.m. and the parties moved off under their respective Capos.
In the outside working parties the working hours were from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. during
Vinter time and from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. during the summer months: there was a break
6f one hour for lunch. The working hours inside the camp varied; they all started
at 6 a.m. and in some instances the internees vrarked for 12 or more hours.
In the kitchen and food store, the working hours often totalled 18 hours per day.
A break of one hour was allowed for lunch for the inside working parties.as well
Lunch was brought to the outside working parties in containers but the parties
inside the camp fetched their food from the cook-house. Those working outside
Ehe camp had their food by the roadside and those inside had their meals in the
locks. The meal consisted of 1 litre of turnip soup per head. On Sundays cabbage

checked at the gate by the 33 blockleaders and were marched to theUKlocks.
They were then allowed to wash provided facilities for washing existed;
many had to go without a wash. The Room orderlies brought "the su per anl
this consisted of 1 loaf of bread for seven people, sometimes it had to
be divided amongst ten people. In addition a hot drink was given out which
was a thin mixture of floor and water and the quantity allowed was -g-
a Iftre per head. There was a weekly ration consisting of 10 gms of margarine,
50 fps of sausage	30 gms of cheese and.20 gios of marmalade, per head.
After the meal the internees were Snowed to go to bed although proper
beds were only provided in some of the working blocks,/r£8st of the
people had to sleep on the floor.

4*	Gamp A, v/omenA camp consisted of approximately UQ blocks,
each block housing between 500 and 700 people. There were roughly the same
number of internees in the men's camp,bringing the total establishment to
over 50,000.
c
5.	The parties working inside the canp were dismissed from their
work by the 33 guards and the same routine .for ideals applied to them.
6,	The official tijjjs for'lights-out' was 9 p.m. summer and winter
although on many occasions we were only allowed to have the lights on
during the meals.	.	: ’fej ^
7,	In addition to the basic routine described above there were
numerous roll-calls, such as if an internee was missing or if any of the
prisoners had coimdtted an offence. When this happened either the whole
block or the entire oanp were called out and paraded during the evening arr
during the night* These parades were much more thorough than the morning
oarades and lasted between three and four hours.	-i
hax/
8,	A general procedure was laid down for the sick. They had t.
report to the block leader on arriving back from work and were supposed tc
sick the next morning. This was, however, not carried out as the block leoe;
had to provide a certain number for work and this number was always made ’p
by the inclusion of the sick people. Only the worst cases could get medica
attention or be taken to the hospital block.

1.	I am 34 years old and after a period of being in and out of prison vras
arrested for the last time on 9th January 1944 for being a Polish Comnunist.
After a few weeks in various camps I was transferred to a work camp at Baad-Saarow,
which is roughly 50 kilometres East of Berlin. I came to Belsen in January 1945.
2.	While at Baad-Saarow I knew a man called Willy Ihonnan who is now in No. 1
Camp at Belsen and I recognised him and reported him to the authorities. He was a
prisoner at Baad-Saarow as a result of crimes of homosexuality and worked in the
kitchen there. He is a German. Other prisoners used to come to the kitchen to
try to steal a potato and he used anything he could lay his hands on to beat them.
He used a good deal more than the force necessary to' stop them doing this. He
obviously enjoyed it and was a thorough sadist.

1.	I am 19 years of age and I was arrested on 12th. November 1941 together
with my father,and mother and brother. We are all Jews.
2.	With 12,000 other Jews we were sent to a Ghetto at Minsk. In June 1942
there was a general uprising in the Ghetto. There were reprisals and mary people
were shot including ny father and mother. The German in charge of the shooting was
,. Hauptscharfuhrer RUHBE. I would describe him as, height, 5ft. 10 ins. thick set,
Jewish nose, brown eyes, sallow complexion and dark hair.
3.	On 28th. June 1942 HUHBE was also in charge of a machine gun party which
killed, I was told, as many as 20,000 Russian Jews and 4,000 German Jews. These
were buried behind the Ghetto.
4.	In September 1942 There was an outbreak of typhus in the Ghetto. The
SS guards came into the hos ital and shot those who could not walk and took those out
who coraid walk into a gas car in batches of ten. I was in hospital nyself at the
tirne^awaiting an operation and saw these shot but for some reason or other I was not
shot nyself. KUHBE was in charge of these executions.
On another occasion I nyself saw a 100 children,aged between 3 and 6 years
shot by a party under Obersturbannfuhrer M&LLER. He was about 25 or 26, height 5ft.3ins
fair hair, blue ey*j, fresh conplexion. These children were omhans whose parents had
been shot in the reprisals.
In February 1945 I came to Belsen and was employed in a factory making
olothaa for the Gennan Amy and later in the kitchen. While in the kitchen I often
saw 33.woman GERTRUD SAUER,whom I identify as No.5 on Photo 19, hit li*1s with a

DSH5SITICK OF HENH? FL0SC2XK, late of Lareaalkowska, 69, Warsaw, Poland, sworn
befoi'e roe Major Geoffrey Smallwood, l ajor (Legal dtaff), an Officer of the Staff
of the Judge Advocate General to the Forces.
I am years of age and was arrested on 24th June 1940 because I vras
a professor of mathematics and had written a number of books. I was taken to
prison in Warsaw aid transferred to Auschwitz on 15th August 1940. On 12th
I arch 1945 I was transferred to Buchenwald and on 8th Je teniber 1943 to Dora
Gamp, KordHausen. On 9th April 1945 I came to Belsen.
2.	While I v/as in Auschwitz I knew an 3.3. officer, Lagerfuhrer ] AT3R,
whose description is as follows:— Height aoout 6it, round face, and well built.
He would call all the sick on Apell every evening and would ask them if they were
ill. When they replied ’Yes* he would have them beaten with a stick until they
fell down. On one occasion a Pole who was sick with dysentry came late to an
Apell and LAYER ordered him to be given 25 strokes on the back. ;ie died a few
days later.
3.	At Auschwitz Lagerfuhrer 3.3. Obersturmfuhrer later Hauptsturmfuhrer
FRITSCH was directly responsible for many people being beaten especially Jews
and priests of the Strafkoropanie. At Apell the dead would be brought on parade
by his orders and would be laid on the ground in front of those still standing.
Sometimes people received a card ordering them to report at his office and when
they reported they were shot.
Between 8th October 1941 and November 1941 about 10,000 Russians
entered the camp as Prisoners of War. They were ill-treated and only given
clothes for use at Apell aid whilst they were working. IMW died from typhus
and many were given injections of ihoenal (carbolic acid) so that they died
within a few minutes. By March 1942 only 500 of them were left. I know this
is true since I was then the Secretary to the Russian Hospital. Those who died
* from inceptions I was ordered to put doen as^havic^died fraa ’ 111	1 Vl	'

DEIOoITION OF KSLBI HALI-jaaiASCH of FOLUI), sworn before re, l;ajor Geiffrey Sjnallwooci,
I-ajor (Legal Stal*f), an Officer of the Staff of the Judge Advocate General to the
Forces.
1.	I am aged 25 years and a polish Jew. When the Germans entered Poland
I escaped to Hungary but was arrested by the Hungarian Police about the end of
September 1939 and taken back to Poland and handed over to the Germans. I was then
placed in a Ghetto at Stanislau and after two weeks escaped and joined iry parents at
Limburger Kreis where I stayed until the spring of 1942. After surviving a purge
uj. Jews in the spring of 1942 ’when some 30,000 to 40,000 were killed including ry
father, mother and five sisters I again got to Hungary but was arrested there.
Eventually I was sent to Auschwitz in May 1943 and transferred to Belsen in February
1945.
2»	At AUSCHWITZ I worked in the Leather Store and also had to attend a number
o£ selections for the gas chamber. I name the following as being responsible for
sending many thousands there;- KEAliPi, MENGELB, K0HIG, TAJ0EER, and of the women,
DHEXHISLER, HANDEL AND HAiSE.
3.	The Leather store in which I worked was controlled by Unteracharfuhrer Otto
'■’HAFF. His description is, about 27 years old, 5* 9" to 10" in height, slim build,
dark brown wavy hair, grey eyes, good teeth and thin face.
4.	During	afternoons G&AFF worked in one of the crematoria. He used to
boast over his work there, saying how he enjoyed watching naked bodies put in the
crematorium — espelcially women's bodies. He also spoke of working on the gas chamber.
He often told the women in the leather store that they would go to the gas chamber in
due course. He was fond of beating women with a stick and throwing them across the
store, and he would make women take down their clothes and beat them with a stick
giving them 25 strokes across the buttocks.
On one occasion during the auitmer of 1944 I aaw him beet a Polish
girl named karllla $ombroska (aged 19). He beat her across the head with an iron
rod and smashed her skull. The girl died on the spot and wns taken to tire
crem-toTium﻿crematorium.
Graff's assdstant at the store was Obersoharfuhrer Paul E?0H. He was
HA2>
about 30 years of age, 5* 6" in height, thickset/very blonde hair, fat round face,
very white skin, clear grey eye^, and good teeth. He used to work in the crematoria
and said he liked the work there better than in the leather store as he wanted to kill
as mary jews as possible in the interests of Germany. In the leather store I often
saw him beat and whip women. Several times he beat women until they could not work.
In the summer of 19h4- he beat a I-iench women ( a Jewess) until she could not stand
and he then kicked aid whipped her vdiilst she lay on .the ground. The woman died 2
v^eks later as a result of her injuries.
In the men* s section of the leather factory was a civilian S3 man named
GKEL3Q5, he was aged about 45, 6 ft in height, thick set and stout build/ olortie
hair, yellowish skin,grey eyes and always looked ill. Prom time to time I saw him
kill at least 50 male prisoners by beating them on the head with a stick. He had
two dogs and he also set the dogs onto his victims. He beat men,often killing them,
every day, for minor offences such as looking towards the women working
in the factory.
8.	On occasion,ah 3S man whose name I do not know - he was an Oberstormfuhrer
visited the factory. He was about 28 years old, 5* 5" in height, medium build, had
black hair, dark brown eyes, dark complexion and had a black moustache. He asked
araff aixl Pfor why more prisoners were not killed in the factory, saying that 5 or
6 should die every day. I have seen him beat both men and women with a rubber stick
for no reason.
9.	I have seen KRAMER when selections were made kick children towards tne
vehicle taking them to the gas chanber.
10.	<ta one occasion HBSWR (B>oto 9 - 1 ) ooCtt «	etealine
exnloaive Pc»d.r. H. had then ell haneed l„ the om* end wo» present at the hanoinc
himself. I and acme other, had to watch the h^nd. and HSiSUiR warned ns thst ^
we would meet the same fate for such offences.
1U	About th. em of March or beginnine of April whilst at BSL3EH a young
Jss^n woman was caught after eacmplng from th. camp. Oh. was hrou£iit back and I﻿-3-

fa...Tirnry (Hioto 12-3), VDIiQSmaH(Kioto 22-6) and EHLEHT (Hioto 22-5).
The woman was screaming in liussian and I do not know whether she died.
12.	I saw l&BXk LUKE (ihoto 25-5) beat a naked woman in the bath house wxth
a rubber stick.
13.	I have haivied to C.S.M. J.Liddle of the G.M.P. (Special Investigation Sector.)
a bottle marked "GLUKOSE"(produced) which I found soon after the British Troops
arrived in a closed German radical box, which contained other radical stores, in
jjo.1 Gamp Women* s hospital. It appears to contain petrol. I believe
the contents were used for injections. A nurse told ra at Auschwitz
that Klein kept"GLIKOSB" bottles and referred to than as "Corpus Delecti"

DEo0SITI0H OP ROMAN SOMPOLINSKI of WHOHJjA 13. LODZ. Poland. SWORN BEFORE:-
1. I was arrested in 1939 because I was & Jew. I am 22 years of age.
I was in rarious working oamps until I was sent to Ausohwitas at the end of
1943. I was transferred to Bel sen in December 1944,
2* Whilst at AUSCHWITZ I worked for three months on general duties in one
of the gas chambers and crematorium at Auschwitz, aaployees on this job
got better food than the rest of the prisoners due to the nature of their
work» At the end of about 6 months, however, they, themselves, would die
in the gas chamber because the S3 tiled to keep the occurrencies in the gas
chamber secret. I escaped this fate because I contracted Typhus and was
femoved to hoppital and later to Belsen. The following is a description of
this particular gas chamber and crematorium and the event enacted therein.
Those selected would be told they were going for a bath. They would enter
the first room of the building there they would undress and be given towels
and soap. This room would hold about 500 people. They would then enter
the second room which gave the appearance of a shower-bath room with stone floor
and wooden duck boards. Hanging from the celling ware sprays. Once inside
the gas would be turned on by an 33 man in a control room underneath the
"bathroom". The people would scream and shout in thfeir agony but the noise
was drowned to anyone outside by a brass band playing outside and a wireless
inside. Those in the chamber would be dead in about three to five minutes.
Ventilators would then be operated to clear the gas from the room. As soon
as the room was clear of gas the workers, including myself, would enter it
from a door at the far end of the room and collect toe corpses. Theadmcfcdu
bodies would then be put on a chute which would drop them into a subterranean
room agaoent to the crematorium ovens. In this room the corpses would be
recetved from the chute by a tipper trolley on rails which would hold about
6 bodies at a time. The trolley would then be wheeled by a worker to a platform
from which the corpses would be loaded onto a metal stretcher. The base of
this consisted of three metal bars. The stretcher would than be wheeled

the furnace by the operator of the stretcher, who manoeuvred leavers which
opened the metal bars downwards. The bodies would be destroyed in about three
minutes. The fuel for the furnace consisted of 'ood and petrol. The S3 nan

C- in charge of uy party on -this job was lluuptuWmfuhrer MOLL. During hie ^ee
months I was working on this particilar gas chamber and crematorium I estimate
that a total of about 20,000 people met their deaths this wajr.
2.	I recognise LADISLAW GRJHA. No.l on Photo 7 as being SS man in charge of
a group of prisoners who collected corpses from the streets and blocks of
Baisen comp. This was between the 11th April 1945 up to the time the British
came on 15th. April 1945. During this time GURA was responsible for many
deaths and beatings which I was able to see from my block. GORA app«ently
was not satisfied with the speed at which this undernourished prisoners collected
the corpses, so he would beat them on the head, and body with the butt of a
rifle. The men would b e left as dead and their bodies would be collected
by other prisoners and taken to the burial pit. About 20 to 25 were killed
each day between the dates I have mentioned in this way at the hands of GURA.
3. I recognise GEORGE KRAFT as No.5 on photo 7 as an SS man who used to
guard the bread and ration store at Bel sen.	About the 12th. April 1945
I saw several prisoners crawl through the holes in the wire surrounding the
store and try to reach through the window for food in the store£^

1.	Referring to my Deposition and Further Deposition both sworn
• on the Slfth day of May 1945» I desire to make a correction in regard to
OBERSCHARFUEHRER MOLL, I was wrong in saying that he was in charge
of my party, I was told at AUSCHWITZ that he had been in charge before
I was employed at the Gas Chamber and Crematorium.
2,	Whilst I was working at the Gas Chamber and Crematorium
S.S. MAN HOESSLER was in charge.	I identify him as No 1 on Photograph
9. I am quite certain this is the man - there is no doubt whatever.
3»	S.S. DOCTOR TAUEE made selections for the Gas Chamber and
accompanied the people so selected to the Gas Chamber. There he handed
over to S.S. MAN HOESSLER. I was not present at any of the Selections
but I was present and saw S.S. DOCTOR TAUBE on many occasions arrive with
prisoners and hand them over to S.S. MAN HOESSLER. I never saw S.S.
DOCTOR TAUBE inside the Gas Chamber at any time.

f.C Moy/r	f?. A. (Af+fS/Zfl■ A/o / ^
GIaas***^*^ ^ 28 years of age and was arrested on 19th. May 1941 at Lublin,
I was arrested because I was a Jewess, my husband who was an Aryan and a
Polish Officer having been arrested in 1940* He was taken to Auschwitz where
he died. The reason nry husband was arrested was because he had married a
Jewess. On my arrest I was taken to Lublin prison where I remained for one
year before being sent to Auschwitz, I was taken to Auschwitz in company wd th
:her Jews who were said to be partisans. On arrival I was made to have a bath
id had my hair cut off and was then placed in quarantine for 6 weeks.
At AUSCHWITZ on 24th. December 1942 I was paraded in company with about
9,000 other prisonlra^ Present on parade were Doctors miGELE and KCKIG and
*	a.	<n/ti /f, coo
aportfuhrer TAUBER. I was one of 3,000 prisoners picked out^by the Doctots
md taken to our huts where we were stripped naked by other prisoners and our
slothes taken away. We were then taken by ' Tipper-type* lorries to the gas
chamber chute. They were large lorries, about 8 in all and about 300 persons
an each lorry. On arrival at the gas chamber the lorcy tipped up and we slid
.
down the chute .md wo^t through some doors into a large room. The room
had showers all round, towels and soap and a large number of benches. The ^
were also smfilwLndowZ high ur	near the roof. ~/sat down
on the benches provided and immediately afterwards the doors of the room were
closed. My eyes then began to water, I started coughing and had a pain in my
chest and throat. Some of the other people fell down and others coughed and
foamed at the mouth. After being in the room for about 2 minutes the aoor
was opened and an SS man came in wearing a respirator. He called my name md
then pulled n# out of the room and quickly shut the door again. When I got
outside I saw 3S man FRANZ HESSLER whom I can identify as No.l on Photo 9.
He took me to hospital where I stayed for about 6 weeks receiving special
treatment from Dr. MENGELE. For the first few days I was at the hospital
I found it impossible to eat anything without vdndting. I can only
think that I was taken out of the gas chamber because I had an Aryan husband
and therefore was in a different category from the other prisoners who vw re
all Jews. I now suffer from a weak heart and have had two attacks since being
all Jews.﻿2-
^el sen.	I do not know the names of any persons who went into the gas qhamber
with me.
3* After recovering I worked in the kitchen at Auschwitz add whilst there
I often had to undress other people who had been selected for the gas chamber.
I left Auschwitz in November 194k and went to Breslau where I stayed for three
months working in a munitions factory. After leaving there I went to various
places working in similar factories until I came to Bel sen in March 194-5*
A. Whilst at Belsen I saw HBHTA EHLEHT whom I identify as No.5 on Photo 22

DEPOSITION OP ALEXANDER KUROk'/ICKI (Male), late of 36 Prosta, Warsaw,
sworn before
•J \ '*) ^
1.
in January 1941 on political grounds i.e. for corresponding with Polish
people in England. On arrest I was placed in prison at Warsaw and in
October 1941 was transferred to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. I was kept
there until December 1944 when I moved to Hgwrthausen and in January 1945
I came to Belsen.
2.	About a fortnight ago whilst I was in Hospital Block
No. 32, Belsen Camp, I saw through the window a man whom I recognized as
a German S.S. man whom I knew whilst I was at Auschwitz. I ^now know
that man to be called HEINRICH SCHREIER though I did not know his name
before. I saw him several times in my hospital block dressed in .’/ermacht
uniform assisting in distributing food for patients. SCHREISR was at
AUSCHWITZ from about November 1942 until ,the middle of 1943 during
that time he worked as Blockfuhrer for No. 22 Block, in which I was living.
I saw SCHSEIER frequently ill treat prisoners at AUSCHWITZ. As Blockfuhrer
he held Appels twice daily and it was during thise Appels that he beat
prisoners. I have seen him beat prisoners every day either with his fists
a rubber stick, a wooden stick anS his revolver. On numerous occasions
I have seen SCHREIER knock prisoners to the ground and kick than and beat
than on the ground. He has often beaten prisoners until they were
unconscious, kicking them with his boots on the head and stomach and. other
parts of the body. I have seen the victims carried away unconscious
to the hospital afterwards, and many of than were .bleeding profusely fran
the head and looked to me as though their skull s had been fractured by the
kicking they had received. Though I am unable to prove that they died
a result of their injuries, I believe many did die because many who were
taken away were never seen again. It was not possible to go to the
hospital and find out what happened to than. SCHREIER beat these prisoners
in the manner described for trifling offences. On Appel we had to remove
our caps when 3CHKEISR camfe on
i the scene and those who did not raise their
-1-	x cfrlt'tOj﻿hats quickly enough, as a sign, of respect for him, were beaten by hii;:.
Also thtose v/ho did not stand up straight or were not in line with other
prisoners received similar tre^nypt*. ^^^cmem^cr one occasion about bay
or Jvme 1943 w!ien 3CHH3IBR beat a man''unconsciou^ It was a very hot
day and men of my block, including myself, were on Aopel of .vhich iCHRET-13
was in charge. One of the prisoners, a man about 43 years age was a little
faint and swayed a bit owing to the hot sun. Just at that moment Rapportfuhrer
STIBITZ looked towards the men of our block. STIBITZ shouted something to
SCHKEIER who then went up to the men who was faint and punched him in the
face and the stomach with his fist. The man fell to the ground. I then
saw SCHREIER kick him again and again with the heel of his boot. He kicked
the man as hard he -oduld in the'
i, front and back of his head and
<»
other parts of his body. The man whose head was bleeding profusely then lost
eohsci$us^&.VViiW<ter tlieApell was over I saw two other phisoners pick up
the unebnSodbhs man and	him into the Hospital. From the treatment which
he received from SCHREIER and from the injuries I saw to his head I feel sure
that the man died. I never saw this man again after his admission to
Hospital. I am quite sure that the man I saw in Belsen canp dressed in
Jehrmacht uniform^is in fact the S.S’. Afth SCHREIER.

DEPOSITIOK OP RSrEE EHflAN (Female) late of 80 Rue des Kenilmonartre, Paris,
sworn before;-
A
ff
/^/V.	~ •V'.
1#	I am 31 years of age and was arrested in Paris in April
1943 by the Gfermans because I was a Jewess, I was then taken to Drancy
Prison in Paris and «n 20th July 1943 I went to Auschwitz, I was transferred
to Belsen on 25th January 1945.
• %
2.	iVhilst at Drancy prison there was an 3.S. man named
BRENNER in charge. This man was responsible for many deaths. In my
presence I have seen him beat, kick and throw stones at prisoners for no
»
apparent reason apart from the fact that they were Jews. I know that two
prisoners at whom this man threw stones died as a result of the injuries they
received. I called at the Hospital on one occasion to see some friends and
I was told by than that prisoners admitted the day before,suffering from head
wounds inflicted by this man, were dead. I cannot state whether they were
men or ^omen who had died. It was not an unusual occurrance to see persons
severely wounded by this man’s brutality.
j.	On arriving at Auschwitz I worked as a nurse in the
experimental laboratory in Block 10. I was present on many occasions
when S.S. Doctor WEBER experimented by taking blood from wdmen for soldiers
at the front. This process was often repeated	the person became
very weak. He also took blood from a woman o\ one blood group which he
injected into a woman of a different blood group. This often caused very
serious illness. In one case a woman died in the laboratory due to this
operation. This Doctor also carried out experiments in rheumatism and I
know that one woman lied 45 injections the Doctor measuring the change of
her heart. This made her very ill. Persons coming into Block 10 were
always the fittest and sometimes up to 300 were in this block. They
were kept whilst a course of experiments was carried out and then sent away.
I should state that the camp in which this experimental block was situated
was a men’s carp and women were only brought there for experimental purposes.
When they left this block they were sent to Berkenau where a selection was﻿to find
made/art those fit for v/ork. Most of the people #10 left this experimental
block were not in a fit condition for work. I have been told by friends
that these sick people were always sent to Block 25 which meant that they
subsequently went to the gas chamber.
4,	I also knew a Doctor SCKOKAKN (7SCHULM6HN) who
exi^erimented on young Greek girls (virgins) for sterilization. These girls
were taken to another block where they were subjected to very strong
X-rays v/nich resulted in their igll ■in'ing Varnt on tne ptotiKioh.7 These
operations did in fact sterilize these girls and many of the weaker ones
died as a result of them. Those that survived were brought back in
batches of 10 to 12 for inspection. They were again operated on and the
female sex organs removed which resulted in their deaths in 4 or 5 days.
I did not myself see the actual operations performed but I did see the
results as it was my duty to dress the wounds of the women. The girls who
had these operations carried out on them only came to'block 10 after the
operation. The operations having been carried out in a different block,
I saw 4 Greek girls die as a result of operations by this Doctor,
5,	There was also an S3 Doctor \YIRTZ, He used to
experiment on women between the ages of 40 and 50 who were having their
Menopause, apparently looking for a kind of Cancer, i.e. Fibrom, He used
to take pert of the womb out for examination under the microscope. The
women became very ill as a result of this.	I did not see any of these
operations carried out but heard of them from patients who had been
experimented on, and nurses who were present at the operations. These
operations were carried out in Block 10 but not in ny part of the block,
6,	There was also another S3 Doctor by name Prof, GIXPKRG
who carried out experiments. This man was a famous Doctor from Berlin.
I have been present during his experiments and have seen him inject something
into the womb of women and then place an electric plate on their stomachs.
The current was then turned on. This was done while the patients were
still conscious and no anaesthetic was used. This experiment did not
take long but must have caused a great deal of pain to the person
experimented on becuase I have heard them shout and cry with pain. Many
found it impossible to walk afterwards and had to go to bed.

The object, according: to Prof. G-LOBERfr, ?/»s to sterilize but I cannot say
whether it did in fact result in sterilization. Most of this Doctor’s
^	,	V	'	x
experiments were carried out on the younger ai^d more beautiful women so that
when photographs were taken the best results were obtained. The photographs
were of the lower part of the trunk and it is natural that from an experimental
point of view theyVwould be- better on the young than the old. These 'photographs
were taken.24 hours after the experiment.
7.	Professor G-LOBSRfi vxas assisted by an S.S. Doctor GEBELS in
these experiments. GEBELS vre.s also responsible for carrying out similar
operationsy
g.	In the simmer of 1944 I T/itnessed the public hanging of 4
women under the supervision of 3.S. man HESSLER whom I identify as Ko. 1 on
photo. 9. At this time Block 10 had been moved from the men’s casp to a
women's camp nearby and re-named Block'women’s camp. KESSLER was in charge
of this canp. The persons hung were accused of assisting other persons to
destroy the crematorium. Some explosives had been stolen from a store outride
the camp and the four girls were the persons in charge of this store. They
were therefore held responsible for the loss and were hung.
q>	xn Prison Block 11 at Auschwitz were kept political prisoners
including women and children. I myself have seen on many occasions batches of
about 100 taken out naked and put against the wall and shot. The shooting was
done by S.S. guards on the orders of Commandant SCHWARZ.

1.	I am 28 years old and a polish Jewess. I was arrested cn 25th. Deoeniser
1939 as a political risoner and was sent to Auschwitz in July 1942. I was
transferred to Belaun in the aujianer of 1944*
GURA
2.	I recognise LADIBLAW/ (Photo 7~l) as being a Blovak and a block fuhrer
at AOBCHvyTTZ. One day in the suranar of 1943 I saw him beat a man on the face and
head with the butt of his rifle for speaking to a woman# The man's head was e ;lit
open and blood issued from his mouth and ears and his injuries a peered so bad
that I had no doubt that he was dead. On GURA's orders some prisoners had to tike
the victim, to the male quarters* On another day in the summer of 1943 I saw
from about 40 metres away $£0RGB KRAFT (ihoto 7 ~ 5) catch a man who also was
speaking to a woman. KR4FT battered the man's face aid head with a stick so that
his head was gashed and blood poured from his mouth and earsj. in ry opinion
the nan must have died since no one could have survived such injuries* I later
saw his body being taken to the male quarters by other prisoners.
3.	On 25th. December 1943 I was sick with typhus and was picked out at a selection
made by Doc toss UENGBLE and TAUBER along with about 350 other women. I w s made to
undress and taken by lorry to a gas chamber. There were 7 gas chambers at Auschwitz
this particular one was underground and the lorry was able to run down the slope
and straight into the chamber. Here we were ti pod unceremoniously on the floor.
Hie room was about 12 yards square and small limits on the walls dimly illuminated
it. When the room was fulla hissing sound was heard coining from the oer.tre point
on the floor aid. gas came into the room. After what seamed about 10 minutes
some of the victims began to bite their hands and foam at the mouth and blood
issued from their ears, eyes ami mouth and their faces went blue. I suffered
from all these symptom* together with a tight feeling at the throat* I was
half conscious when ny number was called out by Dr. MENGELE and I was led from the
chamber. I attribute my esoape to the fact that the daughter of a friend of nine
who was an Aryan and a Doctor at Ausohwitx had seen me being transported to the
chamber and had told *y mother who i mediately appealed to Doctor Mongole.
Apparently ho realized that as a political prisoner I wnVmare value alive
than dead and I was released.	V

chamber would he from 15 to 20 ndmtee,
5* I was told that the staffs of the prisoners who worked in the gas chamber
and crematorium next door changed every 5 months. The old staff being taken
to a villa in the camp to do same repair work. Here thaf were locked in the
rooms and gas boohs thown through the window. I estimate that in December
1943 about 7,000 people disappeared from Auschwitz apparently by way of the
gas chamber, and crematorium*

tworn before Major SAVILE G03FFREI CHAMPICN, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
Further to my deposition ssorn on 26th May 1945*
2.	I first met HELENA K0FPER when I travelled from Auschwitz to
Belaen in the summer of 1944. During the time that we were in Belsen Can?)
KQFFER t<rM me that her husband and soryi were both members of the S.S. and that
she from Cracow. I first heard that her husband was a German from other
prisoners in order to find out the truth I told KOPFER that my husband was
a German. It was then that KDPPER told me the story of her own husband and son.
At Belsen KDPPER acted as an assistant Block Altester, Block Alt ester and for a
while a can® policewoman. She was well favoured by the S.S. and it was generally
known throughout the women's can5> that she worked as a spy for the S.S. KDPPER
reported to the S.S. the names of women who were in possession of valuables etc.
and the S.S. then came to those women and deprived them of that property. Viomen
found in possession of valuables were often beaten by the S.S.
T)t	KOPFKR was Assistant Block Altester of Block 27 in the women's
camp at Belsen and I was in this block whilst she was there. KOFPER deprived
women in the block of their proper share of what food there was because she kept
more for herself than she was entitled to have. The food that she saved this way
she exchanged with other prisoners for margarine. KDPPER frequently beat other
women prisoners in the block for caning to her for more food. She beat them
across the head and all parts of the body with a wooden stick, sometimes three or
four times. As far as I know KOPPER did not inflict any aarious injuries on
those she beat but there was no necessity for the beatings.
^	I have also seen KDPPER beat women prisoners outside the block
in the camp. As a camp policewoman she checked prisoners for small offences
such as being outside the block when an alemt had sounded. For these trifling
offences she beat prisoners with a wood* stick and on one occasion she beat a
of	Ithout roaoon. I did not ... th. Hold-* **«.*.*>*,
friend who had a black eye.
-5-﻿5.
In Belsen KOPPKR used to keep coopcuqr with one of the S.S.
hut he used to visit the block to see her and bring hear
packets of food. When he came other prisoners used to clear out of the way.
KOFFER became pregnant according to other prisoners, and they all said that the
S.S. man was responsible. Then one day in March 1945 S.S. woman EHLERT came to
the block to search for jewellery but she was unable to find any as the women
had hidden it. It had been reported to BHLERT by KDFPER that other prisoners
were in possession of jewellery and when she did not find it she struck KDFPER
and told other prisoners to set about her. KDFPER was hated by the other
prisoners and they all began to beat her. KDFFER had to be taken to Hospital
afterwards and I was told by other prisoners that she had a miscarriage when
about four months pregnant,
I identify No, 3 on photograph 37 as an S.S. woman who was
an Aufseherin in Kitchen No. 1 at Belsen. I knew her by the name of JLSE
FORSTER. I often saw FORSTER beating other prisoners with a thick stick
in the kitchen. She struck male prisoners across the head and wcmen across
the backside but sometimes she hit women on the head too. I hare seen FORSTER
beat many prisoners until they were unconscious and they were then left lying
bleeding on the floor. These beatings were inflicted in a room within the
same building as the cookhouse and I saw the beatings through a window of the
room. These beatings were given because prisoners aaked for food or because
they took food from the kitchen. I have seen unconscious prisoners who had
been beaten by FORSTER taken away on a wheel-barrcw to the Hospital. I dd not
know whether any
of them died as a result of their injuries but many were covered
with blood.

DEPOSITION of Regina. BIALEM (Faaala) late of 16 Squadowa, Lodz,
Poland, sworn before Captain Ronald Percy BETJTHAM-GREEN, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
X.	I am a Polish Jewess, aged 28. I was arrested in December,
1939, in Warsaw by the S.S. I remained in the Police Prison in Warsaw until
the middle of December, 1940, from where I was transferred to a Concentration
Camp at Lublin. In December, 1941, I left Lublin and went to various
Camps, arriving in December, 1942, at AUacUMCH, where I remained until
November, 1944. In November, 1944, I came to 3ELSEN.
2.	I knew the accused. Use LOTH, in Belsen. I met her about
two months before the Camp was liberated. She was a Capo in charge of
the agricultural woricing party. I was myself working in kitchen No. 1
in the Men's Camp. I saw LOTH every day and I never saw her beat anybody.
The other Capos used to take food away from the internees for their own
purposes. LOTH never did that - in fact, she often asked me to get her
something to eat as she herself was so hungry.
There is nothing more that I can say about her as I had no
dealings with her outside the kitchen, but judging by her behaviour, I find
it hard to believe that she would have treated the girls badly.

DEPOSITION OP IREI'!E LOPPLER (Female) late of 1, Agnisnieszki, Cracow,
Poland, aworn before

^.4.'^**/,	&	/C&z1/ a/
1.	I am 24 years of age and because I am a Jewess I was
ordered by the Germans in March 1941 to live in the Ghetto at Cracow.
In January 1943 I was transferred to Plaschau labour camp, which later
became a concentration camp. In October 1943f I was transferred to
Berkenau and in the same month to Auschwitz. In January 1945 I came
to Belsen.
2.
Hefirn £»^£R7~	22,,
I recognize IujUMI	(No. 5 on Photo 2?, as being

an S.S. woman who was at Plaschau.	On 14th May 1944 many of the children ,
sick and aged were being evacuated.	I saw TallF^ on this day pxck up a
child of between one and two years, grasp it by -the calves of the legs
and with all her strength stretch the child's legs wide apart. She did
this two or three times and the child's legs were stretched far beyond
any normal position. It is my opinion that no child could survive such
treatment.
3,	During mg stay at Blaschau I saw Lagerkanmandant GETH
commit many murders details of which I now give. One day in March 1943
I saw the following incident. A friend of mine whose name was OUTER,
aged 26, and whose home address was Mielec, was ordered by GET?’ to strip
to the waist. GETH had two big dogs which he ordered to attack my
friend OLMER. After QLMER had been bitten on the body for about two
minutes GETH recalled the dogs and examined OUTER. Not satisfied GETH
made the dogs attack CO.ER twice more and carried out two more examinations.
He then ordered OLMER to strip completely and turn round. When CUTER
did this GETH took out Ms revolver and shot him in the back of the head.
I then went to the de-lousing hut where I was employed. Five minutes
later the clothes of ny friend were brought in for spraying and de-lousing.
This is what happened to all clothing taken from dead people. In January
or February 1943 I was one of a labour detachment comprised of males and
females employed in the arduous task of filling wheelbarrows with sand.
^ /M>b -1-
-1-﻿
A boy of about 18 years tried to help a girl to fill a barrow when GETS
appeared on the scene. Without a word G1T5I pulled out his revolver and
shot the boy in the back of the head. Nearby was an open grave about
15 metres long where there were already 9 people lying dead. Prisoners
f
were ordered by GETH to carry the boy* s body to this grave and the 10
bodies were then burned with j/ood and petrol. A tMn layer of earth
was afterwards thrown over the bodies. A cousin of mine ESTHA 7/EIZ
aged 20 years, lived in the same quarters as me at Plaschau. 2he girl's
mother lived about 10 minutes walk away in Oraoow Ghetto. One day in
January or February 1943 "the girl left the camp without permission to
see her mother and it was discovered at Apell that she was missing. The
following day the girl was brought back to the camp by the Cracow police.
At 4»p.ra. the same afternoon a special parade for all prisoners was ordered
at which I was presen*. On the parade ground gallows had been erected.
V-
My cousin and another girl guilty of some offence were brought before the
oarade and in front of the gallows. GETH then told all the people the
reasons for the two girls being there and said he was going to hang them.
My cousin asked for mercy and when it was ,not forthcoming asked permission
%
to be blindfolded. This request was refused. One of the prisoners
employed as a camp policeman was ordered by GETH to put the nooses around
the girls* necks.	The steps were then kicked* away and the girls were
hung. At the same time GETH shot them both with his revolver.
4.	I recognize KARL FLRAZICH (No. 5 on Photo l) as kitchen
chief at Bergen-Belsen. One day in February 1945 I passing the
kitchen store-room when a Russian girl in front of me stopped to talk from
the outside to a girl in the kitchen. Whilst she was talking FLRAZICH .
shot the Russian girl. I was working in the hospital at the time and
was present when the body of the girl was brought in. The Doctor with
whom I was working told me that the girl was dead.. I do not know the
gill* s name nor the name of the Doctor.

2^ m. &(a ^fccuiuL	C ^.fk-u^cc
1.	I am 22 years of age and I was arrested on l6th December
1940 at Lodz by the Gestapo. I was sent to a forced labour carp at
Frankfort on Oder and from there I went to Auschwitz in December 1942.
remained at Auschwitz until January 1945 when I went to Nordhansen and
in April 1945 1 came to Belsen.
2,	When I arrived at Auschwitz the transport, consisting of
several hundred people, was divided into two groups. One group consisted
of all the old people and the other the young and healthy people. Those
young people not lOQjS fit were included with the old people.	This latter
group were told that they were going to a camp where there was no work to do.
These people were then taken to the bath-house and ordered to undress. Then
the doors were locked and S.S. men placed the contents of live or six large
tins containing gas powder through a locker into the chamber. I kno>. -hi -
is true because I saw it. I myself was chosen for the gas chamber as I
was suffering from a bad leg. On arrival at the bath-house another
selection was made and all the skilled men were taken out. I do not knov,-
the names of any persons in charge of the selection. As I was a welder I
was one of those taken out. In company with a few others I was taken out
into a square outside the bath-house. Before this we had been stripped of
all our clothing and had to wait for our numbers to be tattooed on our left
arms. Whilst waiting I saw the first group of people who had entered the
bath-house about twenty minutes before, being relieved from the rear exit
of this bath-house dead. These bodies were placed on carts and removed.
Whilst I was waiting I saw a car arrive containing two or three officers
of the 3.3. These officers wore rubber gloves and I saw them empty the
contents of five or six tins into an opening leading into the bath-house.
As soon as this opening was closed from the outside I heard loud screams
from the bath-house. A few minutes later there was silence and a group
of S.S. men with an 3.3. Doctor put on respirators and went into the bafn-
house. I do not know the names of the* . . men or Doctor but I knov he
﻿ruMflfni
1 ^
was a Doctor because I heard him addressed as ' STAliDA-RTSiAhZT', Ai’ter
about five or ten minutes the 3.3. people came wit of the bath-house. The
prisoners who were at the rear exit had to remove the bodies. It was
strictly prohibited to speak to this working party and they were billeted
separately. They were called ’ SCKDERKOMMANDO*. This means’special task'.
These men received better food and were allowed liquor, I believe this
was for the purpose of keeping them in a state of intoxication. They
worked in two shifts and I know that these men were put into the gas
chamber themselves after a certain time. I was told this by a brother of
one of the men who was selected for this work.	I do not know his name.

1.	I am 38 years of age and a Doctor of Medicine.. I was arrested in May
1940 because-I was a Jewess and a-fter being at other places was taken to Flaschow
camp, Poland. I was transferred to Auschwitz on 20th. October 1944.
2.	whilst at FLASCH07/ SS Lagarfuhrer Hanptsturinfuhrer GET from Vienna,
and Obersturmfuhrer JOHN were to my knowledge responsible for shooting many
prisoners. About 60 prisoners were selected every Sunday under their orders and
taken to a mountain and shot. I have seen these SS men march these prisoners
up this mountain near the camp. There the prisoners undressed and some lay on the
•	’ 'l	*
ground and were shot whilst others were shot when they had their backs
firing squad. I was able to observe this quite clearly from the camp.
These two SS men also used to visit prisoners at their working sites and lif in
their opinion sufficient work had not been done or sometimes for no apparent
reason they would shoot one or more of the prisoners concerned. Again
these two men used to watch prisoners being marched along the road- and if, because
T
"<
the road was slippery, they were not marchin - quickly en°iKh^iey would shoot tnose
Kwho could not keep up the pace. My best friend Paula MS* was shot in ^	j
Whilst I was at AU3CHWITZ I was twice selected on parade for the £as
chamber but later took out of the batch because I was a Doctor. I have never
seen the gas chamber but it was common knowledge amongst all the prisoners
that parades were held to select persons for the gas chamber. Persons selected
on these parades were not seen again. On the second occasion I was selected
on the orders of KBNIG and was kept for 18 hours in the bunker amongst those
who had been selected. This was apparently purely to inflict mental cruelty
before I was finally reprieved at the very last moment and sent to Belsen
to assist in my capacity as a Doctor.

IN THE MATTER. OB’ WAR CRI’-'Eo
AND
ATROCITIES AT STARAChOWICE+
DEPOSITION OP RACHMIL CHAJTCff (Male) late of Starachowice, near Raxicm, Poland,
sworn Before Captain ALFRED JAKES POX, General List, D.A.P.M. 86 Section, Special
Investigation Branch, Corps of Military Police.
1.	I am 50 years of age and I was captured on 8th September 1939 «-S
a Polish prisoner of war. I remained a prisoner of war until February 1941 "■'hen
I was released. In October 1942 I was arrested and taken to a forced labour
camp at Starachowice. In October 1944- I was transferred to Auschwitz and I
came to Belsen in April 194-5.
2,	Obersturrafuhrer ALTHOP, a Sudeten German, was Camp leader at the
forced labour camp at Starachowice and I state that he was responsible for the
murder of many internees. During the first six months of my stay at this carp
ALTHOP would enter our huts about three times a week at about two or three o' clock
in the morning. He was usually half drunk during these late visits. He would
pull out his pistol and shoot at us in bed or alternatively he would order us all
outside where he would select a number of the parly, stand them in line -nd
shoot them. Their bodies would be left lying on the ground. The next morning
he would detail a working party to dig a grave and bury the bodies which

sometimes numbered as many as thirty-five to forty. I estimate that ALTHOP shot
about 600 to 700 men in this manner during the above-mentioned period.
abefore ALTHOP left Starachowice camp, he made a selection
of about 120 men and women. They were taken about 100 metres away from the
main camp buildings into a wood. Here ditches about two metres deep had been
prepared. A special party of UkraMan soldiers on ALTH0P's orders threw the
men and women into the ditches and proceeded to throw 6arth into them so that
the people were buried alive. One could hear muffled cries for help as this
process was being completed. All this I saw and heard personally. I have
been told since by Polish prisoners who lived nearby that the earth covering the
grave was heaving for about half an hour after the burial as those inside
struggled to get out. An Uncle of mine Nussan VTN0GRAB,aged 4-5 years, also a
girl named Kinda GOTTLIEB,aged 18 years, both from otarachowice were two of the
victinB of that day. I describe ALTHQF as agad about 4£, height 6ft., fat,
red face, fair hair and right lower arm deformed.
-1-﻿i
ALTH.OP was assisted at the above selection by 2.3, ObersturmTuhrer
^RKKR of tiie Special Branch, aho was a	of L'edicine. In the sa/iner of
1944 a snan escaped from the camp and was not re-captured, BB3EER called a
parade and selected ten men who were relatives of the escapee. These men were
ordered to dig a tranch and then stand in front of it. BECKEfi ordered .3. man
a SCHROTT a Sudeten German, to shoot them, and one by one they fell dying in the
fLl	J
trench which was then filled with e>ojth. „ The desciiption of'BBCKER is:- age

SC HUGH. The first was a native of Skarzysko and the other from Starachowice.
The bodies were buried in graves already dug on SCHROTT * s orders by two Ukranians,
As far as X know there was no reason for the shooting. I describe 'iCHRQTT as

DEPOSITION OP Lieutenant-Colonel JAMES ALEXANDER DEANS
JOHNSTON, R.A.M.C. sworn before me Major Savile Geoffrey
Champion R.A. Legal Staff No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I can .and 32 (British) Casualty Clearing Station and
Senior Medical Officer at Belsen Concentration Camp.
2.	I arrived at Belsen Concentration Camp about 0900 hours
on 17th April 1945-
I went round the Camp and found that it consisted of
one main camp which had been in use for a considerable time and
hutted. This was Camp No 1. On going into the entrance there were
huts occupied by the German Camp Staff. One then passed through
a gate in the wire where the main part of the prisoners' camp was.
This consisted of three Lagers, one male and two female.	There was
also a female Lager immediately adjoining on the north.	The
conditions which I shall describe applied equally to all the Lagers
in Camp No 1.
M.	Camp No 2 consisted of brick buildings and was in part of
the German barracks and lay about one mile fran Camp No 1. I am
informed and verily believe that Camp No 2 had only been in existence
for a few weeks.
c	'phe following is an account of the conditions I saw on
entering these two camps on 17th April 1945* It is quite impossible
to give any adequate description on paper of the atrocious, horrible,
and utterly inhumane condition of affairs.
Camp No 1	The prisoners were a dense mass of
emaciated apathetic scarecrows huddled together in wooden
huts, and in many cases without beds or blankets, and in
sane cases without any clothing whatsoever. The females
were in worse condition than the men and their clotiiing
generally, if they had any, only filthy rags.
The dead lay all over the Camp and in
piles outside the blocks of huts which housed the Worst
of the sick and were miscalled hospitals. There were
thousands of naked and emaciated corpses in various stages
of decomposition lying about this Camp. As far as can
be ascertained there were some 13000 dead lying unburied.
Sanitation was to all practical purposes
non-existent. Pits, with, in only a few instances,
wooden perch rails, were available in totally inadequate
numbers. The majority of inmates, from starvation,
apathy and weakness, defaecated and urinated where they
sat or lay, even inside the living huts.
inadequate.
Ablution arrangements were completely
There was no running water or electricity.
All water was brought in by British water trucks.
-1-﻿Camp No 2	Conditions in this camp were improved in
comparison with Camp No 1, but only in canparisam. The
conditions were, compared with any ordinary decent mode
of keeping prisoners, wile and evil. The inmates were’
housed in buildings, 600 to a building of 150 capacity.
The inmates appeared better clad and generally less
emaciated than in Camp No 1 but signs of starvation were
everywhere. I did not see any corpses lying in Camp
No 2.
Diseases Prevalent.
Camp No 1	Typhus, Tuberculosis and Starvation
Disorders were rife.
Camp No 2	Enteric, Tuberculosis, Erysipelas.
There was no Typhus in this camp.
6.	The conditions at both Camps, but more so at Camp No 1,
were such that deaths in very large numbers were bound to occur from
(i) Starvation. There was obvious evidence of extreme and systematic
starvation both in the living and the dead, (ii) Gross Overcrowding
combined with totally inadequate sanitation. In Camp No 1 things
varied to sane extent frcm hut to hut.but in every case the accanmocation
was grossly inadequate. It is a	general statement to say that
in Camp No 1 ten people were being accommodated in space reaso nably
sufficient for one person, v/hilst in Camp No 2 four people were being
accomraodated in spa ce reasonably sufficient for one p>erson. The
sanitation in Camp No 1 would have been quite inadequate even if this
oamp had housed only a reasonable number - say one tenth of those found
there. This state of affairs had led inevitably to the outbreak of
diseases, particularly Typhus in Camp No 1, the whole aggreivated in
Camp No 1 (but not initially caused by) failure to bury the dead.
7.	It is impossible to give exact figures, but I have no
doubt whatever that many of those who were lying dead and those who
afterwards died were killed from the effects of starvation pure and
simple combined with the appalling conditions under which the prisoners
were forced to live. Of those who died of disease it is fair to say
that the vast majority, at the very least, had been so weakened by
starvation as to have no chance of resisting the onset of disease.
8.	In my opinion all those in any way responsible for
ordering, or carrying out orders, which resulted in the state of
affairs hereinbefore described must inevitably have known that it was
bound to result in deaths on a gigantic scale, and that such deaths were
the only possible outcome of such orders and the carrying out of such
orders. In short, such orders and the carrying out of such orders
was mass murder.
The medical arrangements made by the Germans for the
succour of the sick were so grotesquely inadequate as to be fairly
described as ’Nil*. All those concerned in the German Medical
Services by failure to provide any adequate succour were making it
quite certain that none of the very large number of deaths arising
fron the state of affairs hereinbefore described would be prevented
and the German Medical Services must be held as responsible as all
others concerned, and as accomplices in mass murder.
10.	I cannot imagine any officer or other rani:, medical or
otherwise, male or female, obeying orders which resulted in the state
of affairs hereinbefore described and every such officer or other rank
engaged in any capacity whatsoever in the Camp must have known he was
taking part in mass murder.
11,	It is not possible to tell how long the state of affairs
had existed in Camp No 1 but it would appear probable that they had
existed for some considerable period and certainly for two months
before I arrived on 17th April 1945
-2-﻿12.	It has teen iapossible to obtain exact figures existing
at the beginning as the German Authorities at the camp had caused their
records either to be destroyed or removed. It would appear that there
were approximately 40,000 people still living in Camp No 1 but a n icber
of these were on the point of death from their previous treatment.
In Camp No 2 I was infomed that there is believed to have been about
15,000 people. The total number who are known to have died since the
British first entered the camp on 15th April 1945 is 13,099, the majority
of whom died within a matter of days and were from Camp No 1, but there
were a number of 'deaths in Camp No 2.
Again it is impossible to give exact details but it would
appear that in Camp No 1 there were approximately a ratio of two to one
as between female and male persons.
13.	There were as on the 2?th day of May 1945 in Hospital in
Belsen 11200 persons all of course being from Camp No 1 or Camp No 2.
The total number of deaths on the 27th May 1945 was 54. There are
bound to be a number of further deaths.
14.	Prom information hereinbefore given it will be seen that
at least 26,000 people have died counting only those whose bodies were
unburied when the British arrived and those who have died since/despite
every medical aid whichbe given. It is not known to me how many
thousands were killed in £his camp before the British arrived but I
have no doubt it must have been a very high figure.
15.	The figures given above are necessarily approximate and
subject to such final check as the British Authorities can make, but
they can be taken as substantially correct.
16.	Of those who survive a very large proportion will be
permanently injured in health through their frightful and inhuman
experiences and in particular Tuberculosis will be rife. Further,
a very large number of survivors will be, to a greater or lesser
extent, impaired in their mental faculties as the result of having
been in this horror carp.

Jugoslavia, sworn before Captain ALFRED JAMES POX, General List, D.A.P.L.,
86 Special Investigation'section. Corps of Military Police.
1,	I am 24 years of age and I was arrested on 3rd May 1943 because
I was a Jewess. I was taken to Zagreb prison, and transferred to Auschwitfl
on 13th. May 1943. I came to Belsen on 30th November 1944.
2.	Whilst at Auschwitz I was employed as a nurse. In February
or March 1944 I attended,in my capacity as a nurse, a parade in which selections
were made for the gas chamber. The parade was presided over by ii.S. man
TAUBER. It was the job of nurses at these selections to see that nobody tried
to escape or hide. TAUBER would stand on a stove which was about three feet
high and see that the persons paraded. On this occasion one woman was ordered
to get out of bed but she was too weak to do so. 3he was pulled on to the
floor on TAUBER’S orders but she was too weak to stand up. TAUBER then jumped
down from the stove landing with his jack-boots on her face and body.	The
woman was found to be.dead and her body was taken to the crematorium.
3#	x recognize ELIZABETH VOLEEt-ffiATH as No. 6 on Photo 22 and
remember her as an S.S. woman at Belsen. On l6th April 1945,(the day after
the English arrived) all the internees had been confined to their blocks, but
I was allowed out to collect rations for my block. Whilst I was out I saw
another prisoner who was in a very poor state of health and could hardJy walk.
VOLKENRATH approached this girl and asked her if she did not know that she was
confined to her block. She then struck the girl very hard several times with
her fist and the girl fell to the ground and did not move. VOLKENRATH then
went away leaving the girl lying on the Ground.

WALTER beat them with the' vrooden part of a spade and other woodan implements
across the head and on the face. When they have fallen to the ground I have
seen ALTER kick them. I once spoke to WALTER when she asked me a question.
I spoke in German which I cannot speak well. When WALTER spoke to me I told
her I could not understand what she said and she then struck me across the face

saw him a number of times whilst I was at AUSCHWITZ. I have no doubt
as to his identity.
2.	I	recognise from a batch	of photographs shown to me
Nos	22	and 23	on	Photograph QA/8.	No	22 is ANNA HEMEEL and No 23	is
GISELLE KOHLISCHEK. I knew both of these women at BELSEN. They were
both S3 Women employed in the Kitchen. I have seen HEMFEL beating
prisoners with a rubber stick for stealing or attempting to steal from
the Kitchen. On one occasion I saw her beat a very sick man and he
collapsed in a heap on the ground. I do not know whether he died of
his injuries. In regard to KOHjISCHEK, she was at times in charge
of cleaning parties in the Camp. I have seen her beating prisoners
with a wooden stick.
3.	I recognise from a batch of photographs Nos 2 and 3
on Photograph Z/lt/2, No 2 is IRMA GRESE and No 3 is HILDA LGHBAUER.
GRESE was the SS Woman Commandant of working parties both at AUSCHWITZ
and at BELSEN. I have seen her at both Camps when in charge of working
parties beating women and girls with a stick. Her favourite habit
was to beat them until they fell to the ground and then she kicked
them as hard as she could with her heavy boots. She fre<juently caused
blood to flow and in my	opinion many of	the people she	injured were
likely to die from such	injuries, but I	have no direct	evidence of
such deaths. GRESE was also responsible for selecting victims for the
Gas Chamber at AUSCHWITZ. I was present on such occasions. LQHBAUER
was not SS at all, and she was a prisoner at BELSEN. She acted for the
SS and was in charge of	working parties	under GRESE.	I have seen	her
savagely beat women and	girls with a stick. In many jrays her ill
treatment of prisoners was worse even than the SS Womim. Many of the
victims that she has beaten have collapsed and in my opinion were
likely to die of their injuries, but I have no direct evidence of such
deaths.
4.	Everything I have said herein except in regard to the
alleged ill treatment by SS Man SCHREIER is from what I have personally
seen.

1,	I am 2? years of age and a Medical. Officer of the Russian Amy.
I was taken prisoner by the Germans in the Smolensk area on 31 st July 1942.
Prom 1st August 1942 until May 1943 I was a prisoner in a P.O. . camp at Jelnia,
working as a Doctor amongst other Russian prisoners of war. 1rom 31st ■ ay 1943
until l6th June 1943 I was in a P.0.7/, camp at Smolensk when I was transferred
to an Officers' P.O.w. camp at Kalvarla, near Kowno, hefmm. I was kept t■ .ere
until 13th November 1943 vJien I was transferred to Stalag 3B which was at
Purstenberg an der Oder, Germany. On 5th January 1944 I was moved to Sachsen-
hausen concentration camp,near Berlin and on 7th February 1945 I came to Belsen.
2.	, I can give the following information about Stalag 33» The
Comnandant of the camp was an Infantry Colonel of the German ’(/ehrmacht.
not know his name but he was about 45 years of age and his height about 5ft.7ins.
He was well built. The food v/as very poor and insufficient. There were no
parcels and no mail for any of the prisoners. The Camp Commandant was
responsible for these conditions. He was also responsible, ins •much a. :e
cdntrolled the camp, for the atrocities committed there. At the camp there
was a certain Sonderfuhrer KRAUSE. He was aged about 50 years, height 6ft.,
slim build, aquiline nose, pale complexion, dark eyes, grey-white Hair nd
slight Jewish appearance although he was not a Jew. Tills nan wore ,/ehnaacht
uniform with two silver cords on each shoulder. According to his rank he
could not have been a member of the Tehrmacht as there is no such rank in it.
I was told and I am convinced myself that he mo a Gestapo agent attached to
he. ./ehrmacht. Whilst I was at Stalag 3B I "*aw KRAUSE pick out numerous
rlsoners of war who to his mind appeared to be Jews. T saw him take them to
room where thy were tortured. He dealt with hundreds 0/ prisoners in this
ray whilst I ms there. I saw prisoners enter the room in a fit condition and
saw them leave the room afterwards. Thy came to me .for medical treatment.

-1-﻿Those wIjo hed been tortured had such injuries -s'broken 'Brists, ciarks of
t severe beatings, punctured ear-drums and .marks of severe electric shocks.
They told rne that the' had been tortured in this way by KHAIT’E and by two
Ukranian prisoners, KRADSE accused their, of being Jews, and if they denied
it, whether it was true esc not, they were tortured. The two Ukranian prisoners
I have mentioned were themselves Russian prisoners of war. Their names and
descriptions are:- ALEXANDER JEBATIKSKI - aged 28-50 years, height 5ft.Jins.,
medium build, dark hair and eyes. NIKOLAJ IVANOw - aged 28-50 years, height
and general appearance similar to JEBATIKSKI. I knew these two men personally.
They acted as Gaum police and it was generally known by all prisoners that they
assisted KRAUSE in inflicting tortures upon other prisoners. I have also seen
these men beat other prisoners at the camp. Once I saw JABATIF'KI nearly kill
another man by hitting him across the head and body with a chair.
I can give this information about the concentration camp at
Sachsenhausen. When I arrived at this camp there were about 700 Russian
Prisoners of War. I talked to many of these men and I was told that they
were the only Russian prisoners left alive of an original batch of 14,000
Russian orisoners of war taken to the camp. According to all those I spoke to
the other 15,500 had all dither been killed.diud uf "h t»Lunruty* .	.
was a veneral practice at the camp to make prisoners work on the bomb clearance
in the Berlin area. I arrived at the camp in company with 15 other Russian
prisoners of war,most of whom were officers, including six doctors. One o_
these officers was taken out on bomb clearance and did not return. I was told
that he had been killed by an unexploded bomb which he was digging out. ooon
after I arrived at the camp between 55 and A0 Russian prisoners of war, most
of whom were officers, were brought there from Stalag 53. I recognized them
as some of the men tortured and accused by KRAUSE. These prisoners were
isolated from the rest and I later saw them marched off to the camp crematorium.
X-	4c	£~<x.,	^	.
Idid not see them ^gain after that. I was told by other prisoners tliat they
had been killed and put in the crematorium. After seeing the prisoners marched
to the enematorium I saw the S.S. guards return without them. I do not know
who was the Camp Commandant of Sachsenhauses but one of those responsible ior
these atrocities was the Camp Leader S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer KOLB who I would
describe as aged about 45-50 years, height 5ft.9ina., broad build and brown hair.
lf#	On Wednesday and Friday of each week about 10 to 15 prisoners
were called on parade at Sachsenhaur.an.
I saw these parades frequently.

-2'﻿Before beinp, marched away their teeth were examined by an . . dentist and
i
gold teeth and gold fillings were noted. Then the prisoners were raarciied av/ay
-»ut of the camp and I never saw them again. I was told by certain p -loaners
who had witnessed the incidents t'nat they were shot and after death their gold
teeth and fillings removed.
51	l worked as a Doctor in the camp Hospital. Hospital 2,Hoorn 51»
was reserved for experimental work. Seven or eight Jewish boys aged between
8 and 19 years who had been brought from Auschwitz were kept in this room.
A ./ehrmacht doctor whose name I do not know came to see these boys periodically.
He was about 40-45 years of age, height 5ft. 9-lOins., medium build and sj-ort
blonde hair. The Jewish boys were all perfectly healthy when they arrived at
the camp. When the doctor I have described visited the can?) he gave them
injections. I was told this by a young prisoner who had cleaned that room.
Then the patients were ill for a time with high temperatures. When I left
the camp these Jewish boys were still there still being experimented on.
a.
Another room apparently used for experimental injections washroom	of the
Hospital^ I was told by a number of prisoners that patients in t iat room
received injections which made them very ill but I heard of no deaths. I
myself was not allowed in this room. The doctors who practised in there and
are alleged to have given experimental injections are:- 3.R. Doctor Kauptsturm-
fuhrer HORSTMANN, aged 30-35 years, height 5ft.9ins., slim build, i.lonae hair
and wears glasses. S.S. Doctor Untersturmfuhrer GABEKLE, aged about 43 years,
5ft. 9ins., slim build, dark hair and eyes. This man is a Sudeten German and
speaks Czech.
’Then new arrivals came to the camp sometimes all of them were
marched off toward the crematorium and at other times only part of than were
sent there. I saw this happen frequently. On one occasion I remember seeing
64 prisoners sxrive. They had come from Stalag JB and T recognized many of
than. 22 of the prisoners, including 8 doctors whom I knew personally, were
separated from the rest and marched off toward the crematorium. As on other
occasions I did not see those who went to the crematorium again. There was a
factory near the crematorium and workers from there who were also prisoners
told me that they had all been kill«l. Prisoners arriving from Stalag 3B
were accompanied by a list from which their particulars were read on arriving
at Sachsenhausen. Though I am not in a position to prove it I finnly believe
that the list was prepared by KRAUSE and gave some indication of those he
suspected as Jews etc. There is no doubt in^ndB^^t pfi™, ™	A﻿on the list decided the fate of the prisoners.
7# ‘	At Sachsehiiausen there was a German prisoner named SR. 'T IBGEL
who acted as an interpreter. He 7/as about 56 years of age, height 01'v. 1-2ins.,
stout build, blonde hair, round face, red complexion, grey e;/es and athletic
appearance. At the beginning of February 1945 8-t the time when the Russian
armies were on the river Oder about 80 Russian prisoners of war were called out
jCqAS-CC
on parade. I s-nrr -tihet" paraded in the camp and ease that IBGEL was present.
He was dressed as an S.3. man in uniform. He told these 80 prisoners that
Germany needed educated persons for key positions and that they han been
selected.	They were then taken to Block 58. This was about 10 o' cloc '
at night.	About half an hour later these prisoners were marched out of the
canp and I never saw them again. Shortly afterwards I heard shooting outside
the caup and I was told by other prisoners that the 80 men had attempted to
es^^an^liadllf^een stot -^Ts^sTguards. I was told by other prisoners
that they had seen the clothing of the men brought back into the camp. Later
on that night 96 other prisoners, including British prisoners of war (about
six or seven other ranks), about JO Luxemburgers, French and Russian prisoners,
were marched out of the canp.	At about	4.a.m. I heard more shooting and	I	was
told later by other prisoners that these	96 men had also been shot,
prisoners included a number of my friends and I have not seen any of them since
that night. When I first arrived at Sachsenhausen there were eight or nine
British soldiers there who told me they had been captured at Narvik in Norway.
One of them I knew by the name	of MAJOR.	These British soldiers were	made	to
run round the caup all day and	every day	testing the wearing qualities	of
German boots. Six or seven of them were among those killed when the 96
prisoners were marched from the camp. The other two British soldiers,
including MAJOR, came to Belsen with me. Included in the 96 prisoners that
were shot that night were the following Russian prisoners all of whom I knerw:-
Major General 'SEMYON TKATSCHHTO), Doctor BORIS T0KART3CHDK, and Lieutenant
NIKOLAY NASAROW.
8#	After we arrived at Belsen one of the British soldiers was
sent to Stettin. MAJOR, who was in' with typhus, remained in th- camp.
I remember one morning, shortly before British troops arrived in the camp,
seeinm Doctor HORSTMAHN, who had come from achsenhausen to Belsen, examine
MAJOR. I have previously described Doctor HORSTUAHH. He took HATOR* s
temperature and made a brief examination. He then wrote down MAJOR* s ■
particulars. That same evening MAJOR was takwijn^of
1﻿
k'AJOR T/as in the next 'imam to mu - in the ospital^and when ie iaoved I he-.nl 'p •
' '
the voice of 3.3. man BigilSRICH. After that I never saw M/JOH a^ain. 5 ny
prisonei’s in the camo told rae that he had been shot by E? J’/ERICH. Until that
day I have never seen Doctor H0R3'J3IA1'JH exajnine any patient in the camp and in
view of what heppened to MAJOR in the evening I consider that HOR'rdl‘J3'I was, in
some way, connected with his death.

3.	VOLKENRATH at these selections would pick people out herself,
though sometimes S.S. men of a higher rank than herself accompanied her.
These selections, which were for the gas chamber, sometimes took place two
and three times a week. Those selected -would be told by VOLKENRATH to go
to Block 25 where all persons destined for the gas chamber were sent. Here
they would be kept for two or three days until a total of, say, a tnousand

DEPOSITION OP REGHiA PLUCER (Penile) late of 4, Lagowinska, Lodz, Poland, sworn
before Captain ALFRED JAMES POX, General List, D.A.P.M., 86 Special Investigation
Section, Corps of Military Police.
1.	I am J2 years of age and was arrested in 1941 at Gostinin near
Lodz because I am a Jewess. I was taken to Bruchemfelde Labour Camp where I)y
remained until August 1943 when I was transferred to Auschwitz. I came to
Belsen in January 1945.
2.	In October 1944 I was employed at Auschwitz 'with a party detailed
to dismantle the No. 1 gas chamber and crematorium. This dismantling was
apparently ordered because of the nearness of the advancing Russian army.
The vrork was done very carefully, various stones had to be stacked separately,
and doors,window-frames, fittings etc. were given numbers so that I gathered
that the building was to be re-assembled elsewhere. During these operations
I had access to all the departments of the building and I am able to describe
the interior in a general way. The actual method of operating the gas chamber
and crematorium was told to me by members of the Sonderkommando (special party
employed in the building when it was in use) .
-z)m	The building was surrounded by a wire fence over which blankets
were draped apparently to screen the events which took place therein from
outside view. A garden also surrounded it which was of considerable depth
and again assisted in the screening process. The building itself consisted
of basement, ground floor and attic. In the basement was the undressing room
access to which from the outside was gained either by a flight of steps or a
chute. The chute was used for sick and weak people but o. ten when lorry-loads
of victims came they were tipped directly from the lorry down the chute. The
un-
capacity of thq/dressing-room was such that I estimate it would hold about three
thousand persons. The second room in the basement was the gas cliamber itself
holding shout a thousand persons.
2^	The ground floor was divided into two compartments. The first
was the doctors' experimenting and vivisection room. In this roan I saw a
large glass container filled with some liquid in which were apparently human
organs. I took these to be brains and spleen. The second cormartr mnt
-l-﻿wfaioh was ixiuediately above the undressing room, contained 15 separate ovens
which were in line. They were about six feet long, six feet high and three
/
feet wide. The corpses v/ere conveyed from the gas chamber by means of an
elevator to tliis room, where they were loaded into trolleys .vhich ran on rails
parallel .<ith the ovens. The trolleys would be unloaded and the bodies placed
in the various ovens. The fuel used in the ovens was wood.
Im ediately above the gas chamber was part of the garden and iron
5
here ten small chimneys led down into the gas chamber. Each one showed above
the ear til about a foot and was about a foot square. Each was fitted with a lid.
Into these chimneys were put green coloured powders and some chemical action would
take place and the gas developed would descend into the gas chamber. The attic
was used as living quarters by members of the Sonderkommando. Up to the time
that the building was dismantled Oberstunnfuhrer MOLL was in charge.
I 'IEHEBY CERTIFY that, the said Deponent not understanding English, this.
Affidavit was translated in my presence to thesaid. Deponent before swearing
and I am satisfied that its contents were fully understood by the said Deponent.

for "being in possession of false papers and also for being Jewish. I was taken
to the local prison and on 7th July 1944 was transferred to Auschwitz. I left
Auschwitz in September 1944 for Belsen.
2,	I identify GERTRUDE SAUER, No. 5 on photograph 19, as an S.3.
woman 7/ho 7/as at Belsen Camp. Some time in March 1945 I witnessed the following
incident outside No. 1 kitchen of Belsen Camp. I saw SAUER beat a man, whose
name I do not know, about the head and body with a stick. The reason for the
beating was that the man had taken a meatless bone from the swill tub outside
the kitchen. The man received very severe injuries to the head and was
afterwards picked up by SAUER and thrown into a ditch. I am a fully trained
nurse and hold a diploma for this. It is 1117 opinion that the man must have
died from the severe injuries he received. I also received a beating from
SAUER because I was watching the above incident. %
I identify KAKL FLRAZICH, No. 5 on photograph 1, as an .3. man
who was at Belsen camp. In March 1945 I saw FLRAZICH shoot a woman outside
No. 1 kitchen in Belsen Camp. I can give no reason for this shooting, but
there were many persons outside the kitchen at the time it occurred. I gave .
first aid to this woman,who was shot through the chest and lung (left side),
by plugging the wound and giving an injection to keep the lieart beating. Tne
woman died in ny arms after about 30 minutes. I got the injection from Doctor
Klein' at the German Medical Store. I was not asked the reason for wanting this
as Doctor Klein knew that I was a trained nurse. I saw the body later removed
to the crematorium.

1.	I am 25 years of age and was arrested by trie Gestapo on 4th
April 1943 for working with the Polish underground movement, I was kept
in prison until 15th May 1943 when I was transferred to Auschwitz. On 24th
June 1944 I was transferred to Buchenwald where I left on 15th August 1944
to go to Ellrich lager (work camp) near Cassel, Germany. I remained there
until 4th April 1945 when I came to Belsen.
2.	I identify No. 4 on photograph 1 an an S.S. man I knew at
Ellrich Lager as Oberscharfuhrer KULES3A (Calesson). One day in December
1944 whilst at work I witnessed an argument between a male Russian internee
and a male civilian workman. The civilian worker reported the matter to
the Capo (name unknown) and accused the Russian of having assaulted him.
KULESSA ordered the Capo to beat the Hissian but the Capo refused to do so
whereupon KULESSA took a thick stick and gave the Russian a severe beating
about the head and body. The Russian was severely injured but in spite of
this was forced to continue working.

iar Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age and am of Jewish extraction. With ny mother,
two brothers and two sisters I was arrested in May 19^4 and taken to Auschwitz.
There till ny relatives were sent to the Gan Chamber. After three days I was
transferred to Buchenwald and again three days later to Dors. Camp, Nordhausen.
I stayed there for a month and was then taken to Erlich, Kordhausen, On ?th
April 1945 I came to Belsen.
2,	At Belsen I was employed in the removal of corpses from the
blocks, and during the course of this duty had to pass No. 2 Kitchen. One
day just before the English came I saw the Kitchen chief there, whom I
recognize as Ho. 3 on photograph 3, shooting at prisoners ho were attempting
to steal carrots from a pile outside the kitchen. I saw three fall down hut
cannot say whether they were dead or not. I am nor.' told that the man whom I
recognize as Ho. 3 on photograph 3 is named PRITZ MASSES.	On other
occasions from 7th April 1945 until the English came, whilst I have been quite
a distance away, I have seen MATHE5 shooting at prisoners for the same offence,
but I cannot say whether any were killed, or injured.﻿

witnessed the following incident. Several men prisoners tried to steal some
carrots piled up in front of the kitchen.	MATHES fired at the men with his

No. 1 V/ar Criines Investigation Team.
1.	I am 20 years of age and as a Jewess was arrested by the G-ennans
on 13tit June 192(4 and taken to Berkenau where I remained until I was transferred
to Belsen on 5th January 1945.
2.	//Mist I was at Berkenau an S.3. woman named IRMA GEESE was
responsible for many beatings, one murder and sending people to the gas
chamber. I identify No. 2 on photograph Z/4/2 as IHEIA GEESE. What I speak
of I speak of to my own knowledge.
In*^nn3a.ay 1914 I was working in the kitchen at Berkenau when I
saw a woman, whose daughter was in an adjoining camp, go to the dividing wire
in order to speak to her daughter. GHE3E, who was passing on a bicycle,
immediately got off, took off her leather belt and beat the woman with it.
She also beat her on the face and head with her fists and when the ■woman fell
to the ground she trampled on her. The woman's face became swollen and blue.
A friend of the woman's daughter took her away and the woman was in Hospi wl
for three weeks sidTering fhpm the effects of the beating. &)PH'St
^^haatTt Berkenau I have seen GEESE making selections with
Doctor MEHGELE of people to be sent to the gas chamber. On these parades
GEESE herself chose people to be killed this way. In ore oelnotion b
Au<nist 1941- there were between 2,000 and 5,000 selected. At this selection
GEESE and ?HAGGLE were responsible for selecting those « oi the gas ch-moei.
People chosen would sometimes sneak assy from the line and hide themselves
under their Ms. «** v„,1d go ord rind^oem^
collapsed and then drag than hook into the line ageing It »as general
knowledge In this oang. tl«t persons seleoted in this way went to the gas
chamber.
5,	Gome title in August or September 19H at one of these selection
parades, one Hungarian woman who had been selected tided to escape from the
line and join her daughter in another line which was for those not chosen.

IK THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
ATROCITIES AT DORA CAMP, NORDHAUSKN
FURTHER DEPOSITION of ALFRED KDRZKE (Male) late of
Frankehburg, Hessen, Germany, sworn before Major Savlle Geoffrey Champion
R.A., Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	Referring	to my Deposition sworn on the 4th day of June 1945
paragraph 4, I confirm that the man HESSLER whom I mentioned in the said
paragraph was an OBERSTURMFUHRER. I saw him again once in Camp No 2 at
BELSEN being the camp in part of the German Barracks. HESSLER was then
wearing the uniform of an OBERSTURMFUHRER just as he had worn the same on
all previous occasions that I have seen him. I know nothing about his
work at BELSEN but the work which he did at DORA Camp was that of an
OBERSTURMFUHRER. This rank is approximately equivalent to a First
Lieutenant in the Army. All ranks of STURMFUHRERS are the equivalent
of commissioned ranks and all SCHARFFUHRERS are equivalent to non.-
commissioned ranks. ^2v<<^Cu	cfl'yi**** to /+oSSL/:k
/tjt /3CLa**< yv\(X*-..	/ /
2.	SS STURMFUHRERS in Concentration Camps were very frequently
men of little education and were selected for promotion to STURMFUHRER
rank for outstanding brutalities committed against prisoners.
3.	in the fighting SS STURMFUHRERS were men of better education
and selected for reasons other than pure brutality.
4.	OBERSTURMFUHRER HESTER whom I also mention in ray said
Deposition is quite a separate person to OBERSTURMFUHRER HES’LER.
5.	I know OBERSTURMFUHRER HESSLER well and I have no doubt
whatever as to his identity with the man No 1 on photograph 9«

DTPO I':'IO! OP EDI Til IPIEGER (Female) late of k, Murarska Strasse, Presov, Slovakia,
sworn before Major SAVILE GEOFFREI CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 20 years of age and I was arrested by the Gestapo	on 20th March
1942	because	I am a Jewess. After	staying at Poprad concentration	camp, Slovakia
for two weeks I was transferred to Auschwitz where I remained until I came to
Belsen on ^>rd November 1944.
2.	At Auschwitz I knew an	S.S. woman by the name oi GAL3E	and I identify
her	as	No.	2	on photograph Z/4/2.	I have now been told that her full name is
TRMA GEESE. GEESE was at Auschwitz from about June 1942 until Jlst October 1944.
Until May 1944 GEESE was in charge of working parties of women but from that date
onwards until she left the camp she was a Rapportfuhrerin. I also saw GEESE in
Belsen after I left Auschwitz.
in August 1944 I saw this S.S. woman GEESE, at Auschwitz, shoot a
Hungarian Jewess who was aged about 50 years. I saw this incident from my block.
At this time a transport of prisoners was arriving at the camp by train and when
prisoners arrived all prisoners in the canp were confined to their blocks.
Hungarian wonan stood outside the block watching the transport arrive when GEESE
approached the woman on her bicycle. She stopped and got off her bicycle, asout
five metres away from the woman, and shouted to the woman 1 Get in your block*.
Then, without giving the woman an opportunity to go to her block, GEESE proauced
a revolver from a holster she was carrying, aimed at the woman and fired,
woman fell to the ground and stayed there unconscious. GEESE rode away on her
bicycle leaving the woman there. I saw all this occur from the distance o^
about 50 metres. After about a quarter of an hour the transport passed by and
GEESE disappeared from view. I then went to the woman who had been shot and
found that she had a bullet-hole through the left breast.	I pulled her clothes
open and saw the hole where the bullet had penetrated and left the body,
was a pool of blood on the ground and the woman* s clothing was soaked in blood.
The woman was dead. I am quite certain of this as I put a ndiror to the woman's
mouth to test whether she was breathing and it did not cloud over. After
satisfying myself that the woman was actually dead I returned to my block.
No one else came to see the body at that time as we were still confined to our
blocks.
-1-﻿The body lay in the road for another hour and then other prisoners came out •
and carried the body away to a spot behind a hut and covered it with a blanket.
I did not see the body after that.
4.One day in the beginning of October 1944 a selection to clioose people for the
gas chamber was made inside the block in which I lived. Selections v/ere sometimes
made outside ard sometimes inside the block. The selectors v/ere Comoandant
KRAMER, Doctor MENGELE, 3.S. woman DEECH3IER and 3.3. woman KAKDEL. Doctor
MENGELE was in charge of the selection. The woman GHE3E was present moving
about the block in tiie passage and round the door of the block. All the women
in the block had to undress. I was excused as I was a block-leader. Those
selected were taken to my room to await removal to the gas chamber and I was
ordered to keep those selected in my room. DKECK3LER stood near me all the vime
and I was made to stand in front of the doorway of ny room with my hands out-
stretched. The selected persons endeavoured to escape by passing under ny
arms and between ny legs. When an opportunity occurred I let them do so and
they ran out into the street. GREBE saw this. One or two got away, but
GRESE caught the majority and beat them with her hands and kicked them until
they were forced back into the room. All the girls were nakeo..
5.	i saw many selections in Gamp 'C at Auschwitz and GREGE was
invariably present. At the smaller ones I have seen GEEGE sort out the
weaker women and send them off for removal to the gas chamber. I have also
seen GRESE beating women prisoners at the camp every day, sometimes with her
hands, sometimes with a rubber stick and sometimes kicking 3ien.
3
g.	I recognize HILDA LOHBAUER, who I know by name, as Ho. X on
photograph Z/V2>	This woman was at Auschwitz from “arch 1942 and was still
there when I left. I later saw her at Belsen. LOIIBAUER was a German Aryan
who had been arrested as an undesirable element. At first this woman used
work as an assistant supervisor to parties of women prisoners going out of the
camp to work. Later she worked in the camp selecting prisoners i or working
parties. I have frequently seen this woman beat other women prisoners,
sometimes with her hands and sometimes with a wooden stick. Beatings by this
woman occurred daily. She would beat women for not lining up quickly on
parade or for any trifling offence. Sometimes she would beat other women
for no reason at all except that she did not like than. She was very sadistic.
During the day-time LOIIBAUER, after selecting working parties, patrolled the
can?, as a police guard striking women for small offences or because they did not
satisfy her. I have seen LOHBAUER beat women across the head, shoulders and
-2-﻿Itody often making them bleed. I did not see her kill anyone or knock anyone
conscious but I have been told by other prisoners that some of the victim
tuui to be taken to Hospital for treatment as the result of injuries inflicted
on them by this '.Toman. I cannot recall any particular incident as beatings
by this woman were a daily occurrance.
7.	I recognize ELISABETH VOLKS,TiATH, who I know by name, as Ho. 6
on photograph 22. I have seen VOLKENRATH at Auschwitz frequently beating women
prisoners on all parts of the body with a rubber stick. At selection parades
for the gas chamber I have seen V0LK3IRATH make selections herself of persons
who were to go. X myself was picked out by VOLKEHRA.TH on a selection par ode
for the gas chamber but managed to escape at an opportune moment. Others
selected by VOLKEHRATH were sent to Block 25 of Camp 'A' for transfer to the
gas chamber. Persons so selected and sent to this Block were not seen again.
8.	I identify No. 2 on photograph 37 as an S.S. supervisor of Kitchen
No. 2 at Belsen. I have now been told that her name is FRIEDA WALTER.	I
have seen this woman beating women prisoners who approached the kitchen
practically every day. I have seen her beat prisoners, usually over the head
and face, with her hands, with a hosepipe or anything handy at the time, and
sometimes kick them. I did not see anyone killed or rendered unconscious by

\C.
DSPOSITIOlJ eg	(Male) late of l6, Ranek. Belzice, Hear Lublto,
Poland, sworn before:- TYIcjcA'
M. It / £)Cm &a***>9	^
1.	I am 23 years of age and in February 1942 I was ordered by the
Germans to live in the Ghetto at Belzice. On 8th May 1943 I 'was arrested and
taken to Budzin labour camp which later became a concentration camp.
February 194f I was transferred to Lublin, in June 1944 to Laurahutte, on 12th
February 1945 to Hanomag and finally to Belsen on 7 th April 1945.
2.	On 8th May 1943 whilst at Belzice Ghetto I witnessed the following
incident. Thirty	working in shifts had to dig two graves two metres
deep, nine metres long and three metres vd.de. Then, about 500	the
majority women and children and a few elderly men, were ordered to undress by
Oberscharfuhrer FEIX (an Austrian), a section of them were then, order©' to jump
into the graves by-FS^^and as they landed in the graves shot them >«it;i nis
automatic pistol. More people were order©! to jurp on the top .of those •'Ire.' Gy
shot and they were shot in the same manner, the bodies piling up in the graves.
The last persons so killed had to stand on the zroi edges of the graves, they
were then shot and fell dying in the graves. My mother, two sisters and little
brother died in this grave. I would describe^	as aged about 36 years,
about 5ft. Sins, in height, slim build, red complexion, fair hair and grey-green
eyes.
3.	. On 5th April 1945, the day I left Hanomag for Belsen, whilst we
were all assembled on the parade ground, Obersciiarfuhrer K'.TAKE-.AK ordered -he
prisoners to be quiet and said that if they did not obey his order they vrotil^
be shot. The next moment he ordered one prisoner to step forward end made
lie on his stomach face to the ground. K.VAKIuAK then pulled out ir pistol ^ 1
and shot him in the back of the head. There was no doubt that the mn was .
killed.
lht	KJAKJNAK would watch the prisoners marched out for work in the
morning or at evening on their return. If he saw sick or weak people he
would give the order 'To the ablution room'. This meant that two Capos or﻿*
.S. men, under his orders, led the prisoners concerned to the ablution roam
.where they were killed by them by beating with spades, sticks etc. I was
never present when prisoners were actually killed	v.ry but very oite?'. 'aien
I entered the ablution room in the evening I saw the prisoners -,*o had been
called out in the morning or evening lying dead on the floor. I estimate tn, t
I have seen JO such corpses lying there during my stay in Hanora&g.
5,	Before we left Hanomag for Belsen we had a parade. KJAKIkAX,
vrho T/as in charge of the transport, told us that if anyone did not march pr-operly
'they TOuld be shot. During the following four days march K./AKINAK gave the
order for the shooting of more than JO prisoners v,-ho were too weak and sick
to march in line with the rest. Amongst the S.”. deputed for the shooting
I can name S.S. man REX, who came from Berlin, and Rottenfuhrer G-RAMS, a
Ukranian. Those who were to be shot had to dig their graves beforehand and
were ordered to lie in tham with their faces close to the ground. They were
then shot at the back of the head either with a pistol or carbine.
Also before we left 50 prisoners who were sick and weak were tota
by KXAXINAX that they could stay behind with three 3.0. men. vVhen these three
S.S. men later joined the main marching party between Hanomag and Belsen they
told the Capo, who in turn told me, that they had shot the 50 men. A f*>w days
before we left Hanomag a big grave had been dug by JO prisoners and it as possible
that this was dug to accoimiodate those people left behind us. ■> had dug
similar graves previously and these had later been filled by murdered prisoners.
x would describe Oberscharfuhrer KWAKENAK as follows:- a German
aged about J8 years, height 5ft. Bins., strongly built, grey-brown eyes, long
face, brown complexion, dark shaven and very stiff carriage as if wounded in
back or legs.﻿EXHIBIT 92﻿40li. . '	%.{-L'<Li ■ ( ■aim) late of adobo^ Ciwdh^awariU^ aawm

FURTHER DEPOSITION OF DOCTOR FRITZ LEO
SENT TO JAG, HQ, B.A.O.R.
﻿•?3'
IN THE MATTES OP WAR CRIMES
AND
ATROCITIES AT-VARIOUS CCSiCENTRATICN CAMPS.
DSPO IT1!OH 0^ DOCTOR Fritz LEO (Male) late of LuiLigsfelde, neux Tel
Va (cJ*
I am W) years of age and am a Doctor of Medicine. I was arrested
Ly the G-estapo on 3rd May 1935 on political grounds because I was a strong Anti-
Nazi. I was first detained, v/ithout trial, in a Nazi prison at Dresden for a
period of 13 months. In August 1936 I was tried by a Nazi political court in
Dresden and was sentenced to three years imprisonment. I was then sent to a
'ttt-u
long term prison at	Saxony, which ms for political and criminal
prisoners. I was kept there until August 1938 when I ms sent to Buchenwald
Concentration Camp where I remained until March 1942. On this date I was
transferred to Natzweiler Concentration Camp,hear Strassburg where I remained
until I ms transferred to Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp on 23rd. March 1944.
I came to Belsen on ?th February 1945. In all I have therefore been held in
custody for 10 years, three of which I spent in prison and seven in concentration
camps.
2m	Ror the first 10 weeks in Dresden prison I ms handcuffed with
my hands behind my back the whole of the time. Those responsible for this
treatment were:-
(1)	Gestapo agent 1ESER, age now about 5-0 years, 1.65 metres tall,
medium build, dark brown hair, round facej fresh complexion. Liver
in Dresden.
(2)	Gestapo agent GEI3SLER, age now about 38 years 1.65 metres tell,
small build, brown hair, small face, pale complexion and protrudin'
bottom lip. Also lived in Dresden.
During interrogation I was beaten, with the fist, and kicked by these two men.
Other prisoners there told me that they had also been treated in the same way
by these two men.
Many Russian political CormisBars and Russian Officers, prisoners
of war, were brought to Buchenwald Concentration Camp. Practically all of
them were exterminated. I saw between 80 and 100 Russian Officers ana
• Coranissara arrive daily and I estimate that between 6,000 and 8,<000 were killed
during the time I was at the camp. At first these Russian Officers were taken
in groups to the outskirts of the canp and shot. I Aid not see the shootings
itself but a friend of mine named ERICH FLEL3CHKR and several other friends told
■1-﻿me that they had seen these shootings and others had heard the shots fired.
Later a special room was erected inside a stable just outside the ‘camp. me
stable was in full view of the camp and I sot/ Russian prisoners taken to it
but I did not see them leave the stable alive. Often five and six times in
one day I saw a lorry driven to the stable and from the stable the lorry was
driven back through the carp to the crematorium, which was in the camp,
saw blood dripping from the lorry but it was not possible to see what it was-
carrying. For a short time after the special room had been constructed I
heard shots fired. The sound of these shots came from the stable in -which
the special room was built. Later on it was not possible to hear shots
, fired but loud music could be heard coming froma wireless in the stable.
A German political, prisoner named BENITO	was once sent to clean the
special room in question. This man, who was a friend of mine, was aged
about 35. I do not know his present whereabouts. He gave me the foil caving
description of the room. In one of the walls of the room a gun was fitted,
which was concealed in the wall and did not protrude. It was adjustable and
could be moved up and down. There was a height measuring instrument in the
room and movement of the top portion of this automatically altered the position
of the gun so that the gun pointed just below the sliding top of the height
measuring apparatus. The floor was grooved for drainage and sawdust was also
kept in the room, apparently in order to sprinkle on blood-stains. On tne
walls were layers of paper so that if the top layer was splashed with blood it
could be ripped off and still cleqn naper could be left showing. BIEDEL told
me that he had to clean the floor of the room which was caked with blood mixed
with sawdust. It was generally known by most prisoners in the camp, except
the Russian victims arriving there, that the room was used for killing and that
a Russian Tsarist Grand Prince named KUSCHMIR KDSCHNARSW was in charge of it.
This man was later killed himself by an injection. According to many of tbe
prisoners KU3CPNAREW dressed himself as a Doctor and represented the room to
be a medical room. He took Russian prisoners into the room inrlivadually and
apparently made some pretence at examination. Then, operating the height
measuring instrument, he fired the gun in some way so that the bullet entered
, the base of the skull and the victim was killed instantly. The wireless was
kept playing all the time ani tide apparently drowned the noise of the silenced
gun. As each victim was killed he was taken from the room and another
prisoner entered. After a time a special type of vehicle was employed to
go to and from the special room and the crematorium. The prisoners had seen
-2-﻿blood dripping from the ordinary type vehicle and the new vehicle was fitted
r/ith a ainc water-tight body. I saw this vehicle on many occasions and no
blood could drip from it.
2^	The building used sis a crematorium at Buchenwald, which I have
seen and was generally known by all in the camp, did not apparently destroy
«n the bones of the victims taken to it. According to many of my friends
some of the bones were found in a stream which ran through the camp. hy
friends told me that they had examined the bones and had discovered that bones
of the neck and head showed distinct signs of a bullet-hole. Prisoners
working in the crematorium later told me that when che f iniing oi the hone -
in the stream came to the notice of the d.3., a grinding machine was brought
to the crematorium.	Prom then onwards bones not destroyed in the crematoriui
were ground to powder in order to eliminate the possibility of prisoners
finding out anything more. Those who gave orders for these atrocities and
were responsible for the killing of the Russian prisoners in the manner I have
described were:-
(1)	S.S. Standartenfuhrer KOCH (Camp Commandant), aged now about 42-45 years,
1.65 metres height, small build, brown hair.
(2)	S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer FLORSTEDT, aged now about 45 years, 1.80 metres
height, broad build, dark hair.
(3)	S.S. Lagerfuhrer SCHOBERE, aged now about 45 years, 1.62 metres height,
small build, brown hair.
These three men were in control of the camp.
5.	On one occasion about 194D to 1941 all prisoners in the camp were
punished because a pig belonging to the 3.3. had disappeared. The prisoners
were made to stand on Apell for eight hours and for three days were deprived of
all food. For another three days the only/ food allowed was soup and a. lx ' tie
turnip. Consequently as they were all so undernourished 300 to 400 of them
I worked in the Hospital of the Russian camp at Buchenwald.
There was accommodation for/i® patients there and at one time there were
2,000 Russian prisoners in the camp. Between November 1941 and January 1942
there was an outbreak of typhus amongst patients in the Hospital where I worked,
On three occasions 12 patients (a total of 36) We taken out of the Hospital.
I saw them taken out and I did not see them again after that. I am convinced
that these men were killed and taken to the crematorium. The S.S. Doctors
responsible for these atrocities. They are:-﻿(1)	S,3. Obersturrafuhrer HOVSN, aged now about 37 years, 1.70 metres height,
,	' slim build, small face.	^
(2)	S.S, Hauptsturmfuhrea? Doctor )(_AX PLANCKE (fron. Dusseliorf) , ^gen na\:
about 38*years, 1,80 metres heigh*, broad build.
Doctor HOVSN once said in my presence ' Alien you have typhus there is only one
way, the crematorium'. That is why I am convinced that the 36 patients I have
mentioned did in fact go to the crematorium.
7<	I am satisfied, from my own observations as a Doctor, that Doctor
HOVEN made and ordered many injections resulting in the deaths of patients.
These orders were carried out by German prisoners working in the Hospital.
Patients brought to the Hospital suffering from long illnesses from wmch they
could not possibly die quickly did die suddenly and quite unexpectedly. 1
them die and found them dead. That is why I am certain that they had received
injections. Typhus cases always died suddenly and unexpectedly. The Hospital
ms visually full and other patients were always waiting to be admitted.
Tuberculosis patients were, I feel sure, exterminated by injections. A f^end.
of mine named KAKL FEIX, nor/ dead, told me that he had seen injections raven .
and that the man responsible for giving these injections was a man I knew as:-
3.S. Standartenfuhrer Doctor DING, aged now about JO years,
1,70 metres height, medium build, blonde hair.
8.	At Buchenwald there was a leader of the political section named:-
3.3. Ober - or- Unter - stormfuhrer FKEKECHS, aged now about 45 years
1,75 metres height, small build, small face, bala head.
I knew this man and I later saw him again at Belsen where he was also political
section leader. At Buchenwald I saw this man make selections among the
prisoners and those selected were, I am quite certain, sent to experimental
Hospitals at Buchenwald and elsewhere. % reason for saying this is as
it
follows. At Buchenwald there ms an experimental Hospital of which doctor
HOmi ms in charge. Prisoners selected by FRERICH3 and sent there were kept
in a special compound of the camn. I was able to speak to some of them and
they told me of the injections which Had been given and of the deaths that
followed. One of those who died was a man named STOECKEL whom I knew, .and
others in the compound told me of his death. Other prisoners selected were
sent to an experimental Hospital at .^r«nburg and .3. drivers who took them
there told me and described the place as a killing station. Local newspapers
from many parts of Germany were allowed at Buchenwald and in some of these
papers I nyself read of the deaths of men who had been sent to ]$-*iburg.
■nwy were reported as natural deaths. When the 3.3. learned that prisoners﻿were finding out about Berfnburg by .his means papers were banned for a i' e.
fhe deaths reported in the local papers (from where the various prisoners
originally came) followed closely on the removal of the men to er# bur .
There is no doubt, in my opinion, that the . . sent notification to t!_e
relatives of the men who died but always said that death was due to natural
causes. This applies to those who lived in Germany.
q ^	Another man at Buchenwald whom I name as responsible _or many
deaths was:-
S.S. SturmbancLfuhrer I?0DL, aged now 45-50 years, 1.75 metres height,
broad build, stout, brown hair. Bavarian appearance.
This man deliberately ma.de Apells last as long as possible, often as long as
eight hours, irrespective of weather conditions. „ The long standing caused
of those who were weak to collapse and die on the spot,
one hot day when BOOT, • was in charge of Apell, the prisoners were kept standing
for hours and I saw between 30 and fO men collapse and die through exhaustion.
10<	in addition to beatings a common punishment at Buchenwald was
to tie a prisoner* s hands behind ids back and then hang 1dm up, off the
ground, by ids hands from a branch of a tree. I have seen as many as 50 men
hanging in this way at the same time. This punishment was inflicted for
minor offences such as smoking. According to the nature of the o: enoe ?;nd
the temperament of the S.S. man responsible the length of time .'or such hanging
varied from half an hour upwards to as much as six and a half nours.
punishment was extremely painful and victims took weeks and months to recover
from the paralysis caused to their arms. I name the allowing . . men as
being responsible for atrocities of this natures-
fl) s.3. Untersturmfuhrer 11ACKMANN, aged now about 30 years, 1.70 metres
height, slim build, light brown hair. This man made prisoners work
very hard and inflicted the punishment mentioned on those who could
not keep pace with the others. I was told by other prisoners tint
they had seen HACKMAHN swing his victims to and fro as they hung thus
increasing the pain.
(?)	. . oharfuhrer CMCER, aged now about 38 years, l.T^fitres ird -ft,
J , brown hair,
He hunt- his victims on hooks in one of the "in	liters an- ^tt
many of then there until they died. I saw the dead bodies removed from
the «* ■■	shelter.
(3) S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer rf&TTIGH, aged now about 45 years, 1.80 metres
heiglit, slightly bald, very broad build, stout.
(4)	S.S. Lagerfuhrer ’CHOBBEC’. Previously described.
(5)	S.S. Sturmbandfuhrer RCDL. Previously described.
(6)	S.S. StandartenfuJirer KOCH. Previously described.
(7) S.S. Kauptsturmfuhrer PLOK'TEDT. Previously described.
-5-﻿All these seven men have either ordered or carried out this form of punishment*
I have actually seal this punishment carried out in many cases and I have'heard
.,iany of tlie orders /riven. Other prisoners, including some of the prisoners
on whom this punishment had been inflicted, also told me of the activities of
these seven .3. men in relation to this form of punishment,
11.	At Buchenwal^ all >.3. personnel inflicted ^floggings* consisting
of 25 strokes with a stick across the back. I believe that orders were
received from Berlin for these floggings to be carried out in many instances
as the 3,3. man inflicting the punishment often carried a paper and read it
before flogging commenced. S.3. men also flogged prisoners without any orders.
Victims have told me that for one minor offence in some instances a man has
received two floggings - first on the spot and then later on orders (supposedly
from Berlin). When floggings were ordered from Berlin the victims were first
taken before one or other of the doctors already mentioned and medically
examined. If they were fit enough to stand the punishment it was given at
once. Occasionally the punishment was held over, usually to allow a previous
injury to heal, but it was never forgotten. It was inflicted at a later date.
I witnessed many of these floggings myself.
P2,	Some of the prisoners were occasionally allowed to write letters
v/hich were censored by:-
S.S. Oberscharfuhrer SCHMIDT, age about 32 years, 1.78 metres height,
small build, blonde hair.
Often, because he could not read the writing, SCHMIDT would come to Apel and
call the numbers of the men whose letters he could not easily read.	he tnen
beat them with his hands. I myself was beaten by SCHMIDT because of this and I
also saw him beat others.
P3.	1 name the following S.S. man as being responsible for beating
many prisoners with his hands, a stick and by kicking. I have seen him beat
prisoners in this manner.
S.S. Scharfuhrer KIBITZ, aged now about 35 years, 1.80 metres height,
heavy build, dark hair.
15>	k friend of mine named ERICH EI3LER (present whereabouts unknown)
told me that the following 3.3, man was responsible for many beatings and
«
killings at Buchenwald:-
h Scharfuhrer ABRAHAM, aged now about 35 years, 1.78 metres height,
broad build, blonde hair.
On one occasion ABRAHAM was in charge of a party of prisoners who were
engaged in cleaning out a grease trap. He pushed one of ^the prisoners into﻿the filth of the grease trap end kept him in it until the man died. The other
29 prisoners returned to the camp. Some of them told ne v/hat ha/1 happened.
-JiRAHA}/ took the numbers of the 29 men.	In the subseouent days I heard some
of the men called to the gate by their numbers. I was told by other men that
all these 29 men were called. My friend ERICH EI3U5R told me tii&t they had.
all been sent to the aafl raid shelter, in the charge of . . Scharfuhrer
SOMMER (already described), and were killed there. I did not see their
dead bodies. I did not, however, see any of these men alive in the camp
afterwards. Other prisoners told me that the 29 men were killed because they
had seen their comrade pushed into the grease trap and suffocated.
14.	Another S.S. man at Buchenwald who was responsible for many
deaths and in fact was commonly known in the camp as 'The Killer of Buchenwald'
is:-
S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer EISELE, aged now about 39 years, 1.80 metres
height, broad build, blonde hair and wore Bavarian costume.
He was feared by all the prisoners in the camp. Many prisoners told me that he
was responsible for experimental injections but I did not see him make one
himself. He is alleged to have killed many Hospital, patients. . He also went
out into the camp and selected strong healthy men, took tnem to wie noopital
and gave them injections which killed them. This was done, according oo o -her
prisoners, in order to test the powers of his poisons as though they were a
novelty to him. This man later came to Hatzweiler concentration carp.
15.	X was one of a party of 400 prisoners sent from Buchenwald to
Natzv/eiler to build the camp there. The first Canp Commandant was S.S.
Hauptsturmfuhrer KHTTICH, whom I have previously described. He was there
until about May 1942. The second Commandant was:-
S.S. man ZILL, aged now about 40 years, 1,62 metres height, very
small build, blonde hair, blue eyes.
He was there from about May 1942 until about April 1943. The third Conmumdant
was KRAMER who was later Ckraaandant of Belsen Concentration Oanp. e was
at Hatzweiler from April 1943 an<* »till there when I left in March IWu
All t’nree of tiiese men'were responsible for atrocities committed at hatzweiler
Concentration Canp. '
16.	The canp was build in a mountainous region and the work under
iasilijijaKwns very strenuous. Of the 400 men from Buchenwald sent r build .1°
carp over 200 were killed or died of exhaustion and malnutrition. Killings
and beatings were common.

‘has man mo reoponsible for daily l)eatin»s. I ski him beat men with his hands,

18.
3,S. Lagerfuiirar SEU33, aged na.T about JZ 35 years, 1.64 metres
height, medium build, upturned nose.
I heard this man order many beatings which were inflicted op his orders by °tner
S.S. men.
19.
S.3. man FUCHS, aged now about 43“45 years, 1.70 metres heigho,
broad build, stout, dark brown hair, round face.
i l
I saw this man shoot and kill about six prisoners (not all at the same time) who
were working on the outskirts of the camp. He apparently shot them because they
ventured too far from the place at which they were working. He also took
prisoners out who had come from Alsace Lorraine and shot them. I was told this
by other prisoners and I believe the orders came from Berlin, otherwise there
would be no apparent purpose in shooting the men merely because they came from
Alsace Lorraine.
20>	Under ZILL a new road through the mountains was built,
prisoners were compelled to work at such a pace that many of then, died from
exhaustion. I was told this by a friend of mine named FRITZ PROLL (present
whereabouts unknown) and by other prisoners.
21n	when KRAMER arrived at the canro I believe he had come from
Auschwitz. At Natzweiler he sent many prisoners to the gas chamber. I
saw the gas chamber which was built just outside the camp and I spoke to
prisoners -who had been made to built it and they told me what it was.	On
three occasions I -was told by 3.3. men, whose names I do not know, that on
orders of KRAMER they’ had taken prisoners to the. gas chamber. I was also told
that on one occasion KRAMER and an 3.3. Doctor Obersturmfuhrer MlfflRR Von
SOTHMAHN had looked into the gas chamber through a small window while the
victims were being gassed. Gome of these 3.3. men also told me that they had
heard the prisoners crying inside the gas chamber and that they had loaded the
dead bodies on their vehicles and driven then to an anatomical institute in
Strasburg.
22-	Some tin* in 19« 50 anmen, the only -inner, ever to be brcusl't

-A—﻿out 'by:-
,S. Doctor 3EBGER, aged now about 35 years, 1.80 metres height,
broad build, blonde liair.
He came from Berlin specially to carry out these experiments and I had to
assist him. After the experiments were over the 30 women were taken to the
gas chamber and killed on KRAMER’s orders. ,3. men who escorted them there
told me the story. I myself saw the women drive in a lorry towards the gas
chamber and I did not see any of them again after that.
23.	Later in 1943	100 men were brought from Auschvdtz to Natzweiler
for experiment. These men were only X-rayed and I had to assist Doctor BEHOER
in X-raying them. Afterwards tlvy too were sent to the gas chamber. . . nen
who took then there told ne.
24.	A short time later more experiments were carried out by:-
Professor WIMMER (Luftwaffe), aged now about 40 years, 1.70 metres
height, small build, light brown hair.
This man came from Strasbourg University and I saw KRAMER select .12 prisoners
(all criminals) and send them to WIMMER for experiment. WIMMER treated the
12 prisoners with liquid gas on their arms. I did not see the treatment given
but the men told me and I had to attend to the blisters which resulted. Of the
12 men three died as a result of the experiment.
25.	. Soon after this another Professor arrived from Strasbourg University.
His name is:-
Professor PICKER (Luftwaffe), aged now about 35 years, 1.72 metres
height, broad build, dark hair, grey eyes.
• •
Ten prisoners were selected by KRAMER and sent to PICKER. The man PRQLL told
me that KRAMER selected them. These 10 men -were then taken to the gas chamber
after they had been given injections and tablets first.	They were then
compelled to inhale poisonous gas.	Though they were all ill afterwards none
of them died as the' result of the experiment which was to test the means of
combatting poisonous gas.	I was told all this by the 10 victims.
26.	At the end of 1943 about 70 to 80 gypsy men arrived from Auschwitz.
Those that got to the camp told me that other men had died on the way,
sen were wanted for exneriment but we	O be unsuitable owing to their
week condition. P7K3LL told me that he haiMrt KRAMET ———1"	^	thc

very weak ones. I saw the Capo, -1 nnrut.^mv	nmiu .1	* ««»«»«, give
A
injections of creosote into the hearts of 20 of the men and they died. The
remainder left the cam, and I do not know what happened to them.
-9-
/﻿27.	About the beginning of 1944 a further 80 gypey prisoners, all
,aen, arrived from Auschvdtz. They were in good physical condition.
Professor, whose name I do not know, arrived from Bacteriological Institute
of Strasburg University. The Professor injected 40 of the men with typhus
serum and a few weeks later he came again and injected all 80 of the men with
typhus. I saw some of the injections given and PSOLL saw some of hem given
and told me. I left the camp before the result of this experiment was known
but in ny opinion as a Doctor I believe that some of the men must have died.
I would describe the Professor as about fcJ? years of age, 1.80 metres in heignt,
■wOT build, grey hair, small face and pale complexion.
28.	At Natzweiler there was an 3.S. man named:-
S S. Untersturmfuhrer KERMAM CAMFE, aged now about 43 years,
1.68 metres in height, slim build, light brown hair. He came
from Leipzig.
This man forbade a convalescent block for sick.men to be used and he insisted
on all prisoners, sick included, working in cold weather -without sufficient
clothing. Consequently many prisoners died through exposure and weak condition.
29	There was an out-camp to Natzweiler which I visited.
of this out-camp was:-
0berscharfuhrer 3EUSS (brother of the other 3EU8S previously
mentioned. His age now is about 33 years, 1.80 metres in
height, broad build, blonde hair.
This man -was responsible for many beatings and frequently deprived prisoners
of their food. He also refused to allow medical treatment to prisoners who
were ill or injured until it was too late and they died. The prisoners
working at the camp told me of the conditions there as did those who were
eventually sent to me for treatment. Many of these prisoners came too late
for the treatment to cure them.
j0.	In the Hospital at Natzweiler there was the S.3. Doctor
Obersturmfuhrer FREIHERR Von B0THMAHN, already described. I saw this man
take the numbers of patients suffering from tuberculosis and later, on his
orders, I saw the Capo^Lnjact the same men with creosote and the men lied.
I In n""	^	''■ln r’,wu ",hn ,,nllfl n H	^ h”R r'iT1C* ,lied
lias since -lied.
I know of these injections because I saw them take place.
31#	About the end of 1942 a Russian Officer Prisoner of War who had
escaped from the camp was caught and was killed by an injection,
injection was given by Doctor FLANKE, already described*
given and I saw the prisoner, who was in reasonable good health before, die
shortly afterwards. The injection given in this case was Svipan {Narcotic. .﻿j2.	.Then I arrived at Sachsenltausen I was told by Russian prisoners
of vmr there t'nat many tliousands of their number, all Russian prisoners of war,
had already been killed or had died of starvation in the carp. There were
seven or ei"ht British prisoners of v/ar at tlds camp and they told me they Jiad
been captured in Norway, during one of the raids made on Norway by ritish forces
At tiie can?) they were dressed in civilian clothes having been deprived of their
uniforms by the G-ermans. I knew one of them by the name of MAJOR. These
British soldiers were made to run round the car?) all day and every day often
carrying heavy packs on their backs. This was done to test the quality am
wearing of German boots. The men covered L£ kilometres daily. At the carp
at this time were also a number of Norwegian prisoners who told me that they
had been in prison for attempting to escape to England rom Norway.
Norwegian nrisoners were able to get mail. Red Cross parcels etc. and Bn ci..n
battle—dress v/hich they wore was also sent to them. ihe British soldiers
were not allowed any such privileges and nor were most of the other prisoners.
The Norwegian prisoners therefore helped the British soldiers to. sustain
themselves by sharing their Red Cross parcels with them. Without that extra
food the British soldiers could not have stood the strain of running each a y.
The 3.3. discovered what was happening and then forbade the sharing oi Red
Cross parcels.
p remember that one day about the beginning ox February 1945>
just before I was moved to Belsen, many prisoners were shot. oO Russian
prisoners were called for at about 10 o' clock at night, they were taken out
of the camp and shot by the S.S. Later the same night a further 96 prisoners
including ail the British soldiers except two, Russian and French prisoners,
were also taken out and shot by the S.S. I was told this by the air raid
warden for the camp, a prisoner named-***?**, who said that he accompanied
the men to the gate. At the time of these atrocities the Gamp Commandant
was:-
S.8, oturmfuhrer KEMTDL, aged now about 45 years, 1.70 metres
height, medium build.
As Camp Orwnarvlant he wn.? responsible '*or criers and was therefore responsible
for the shooting, though T do not know wlio actually shot the prisoners. 0*’
the two British soldiers who escaped the shooting, one was in Hospital at 'he
time, and the other, known to me as MAJOR, was in a different part of the
c«mp. The)’ my have been overlooked. I never saw the other British
soldiers again.
-11-﻿34.	The two British soldiers I have just mentioned ceme to Belsen
i me. Dne of them moved on and X was told he went to Stettin. . MAJOR
who was ill vdth typhus stayed be’uind. One night shortly before British
troops entered the camp MAJOR v/as ttiken from liis bed and carried away on a
stretcher. I was informed of this immediately by another prisoner. ?14J0R
v/as a popular man with all those who knew him and everyone knew at once that he
had been taken out. I never saw MAJOR-again after that end according to what
I was told by many other prisoners he was shot dead that same night by . , man
EMMERICH and his body was taken straight to the crematorium. I did not see
}&jn* killed.
Further to ny deposition made before Major Cochrane on 7th tf-ay
1945/give the following explanation of various paragraphs as now mentioned.
Para. 1. In this paragraph I refer to the fact that there were three barracks
in Camp No. 2 provided for medical treatment. This Carp 2 is the second part
of the mends Canp in Carp No. 1 and is not to be confused vdth. Carp No. 2 which
lays about a mile from Carp No. 1.
The Doctor HOISTMA.M whom I mention in this paragraph is describee by
me in this deposition.
Para. 2.	S.3. Obergruppenfulirer POHL is about 40 to 50 years o± age, 1.75
metres in height, and broad build. He wears Ritter Kraix (Knight* s Gross; on
his uniform. A prisoner who was a carp leader told me this man* s name. I
also overheard 3.3. men mentioning his name whilst he was in the camp.
The remark by Rapportfuhrer EMMERICH 'Tomorrow we shall have a
procession* was told to me by a Carp Leader, whose Christian name was IDE who
said he overheard EMMERICH saj*- this.
The fact that the Forest Administration had not allowed wood to be „
taken for maJd-ng a pyre was told to me by .an 3.3. Carp Leader.
A more complete slory of the experiments made on Gypsies with typhus
injections is given by me in this deposition.
pr,r. t 3t The whole of the facts in this paragraph happened about two months
before I arrived in Katzweiler camp and were told to me by other prisoners.
Parft, 4, The Commandant mentioned in the first part of this para.^aph is
Commandant KRAMER. The women victims told me that they had been told they
were being transferred to another carp.
The fact that Commandant KRAMER and the Camp Doctor observer! the
effects of as by looking through a built-in window was told to me by an
■12-﻿>	tor who escorted the women to the gas chamber. In this deposition I liave
^ given the name of the Camp Doctor, Doctor BOTHMAJJN. I do not know the natop
^of the V . c- a tor.
Para, 5. I have given more details on this subject in ay'present deposition.
The fact that the prisoners went to the gas chamber was told me by the under-
mentioned S.S. man who accompanied them there:-
d.S'. man G-l^ShLACK, aged now about 50 years, 1.68 metres height
slim build, little grey hair, wears spectacles.
Para. 6, I saw' the apparatus mentioned in the first part of this paragraph.
I did not see the experiments carried out with mustard gas but I have to treat
the victims afterwards. I was told by 3.3. men that it was mustard gas.
I saw the three dead men and was present when Professor Y.IMIER
examined their wounds and photographed them.
Para, 7. The fact that an air-tight chamber with a window for observation
had been erected half a kilometre from Natzweiler camp was told to me by the
J saw ^ne protective tablets myself. They were made of white
powder and were in a glass phial marked Urotropin.
As I have already stated I myself made the X-ray photographs of
the men who were experimented on in the gas chamber. They suffered from a
severe form of catarrh and coughing. The men had been sent into the gas
chamber two at a time and each was given a different quantity of the antidote
tablet. I had to prepare records which proved that according to the amount of
the antidote given so the man could withstand a corresponding strength of gas.
This was apparently an important discovery. I have since learnt that nlTLEh's
personal Doctor who visited the camp to see the results of these experiments
was 3.3. Doctor Obergmppenfuhrer BRANDT. I have already described him to the
best of ny ability but I did not see him very closely and all that I can add
is that he was of medium build. He did see all the patients and tlien Icj. t
the camp with Professor PICKER who returned to the camp.
P ,rn. 8. The dead bodies I mention in this paragraph as coming in on the
transports were seen by me and I saw that they were mostly decormposed.

SECOND FURTHER DEPOSITION of DOCTOR FRITZ LEO
(Male) late of Ludwigsfelde, near Teltow, near Berlin, a German subject,
sworn before Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, R.A., Legal Staff, No 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team. .
1.	Referring to my previous Deposition sworn on the 2nd day of
June 1945 paragraph 34, I was told at the time by NIKOLAJ SCHEKLAKOW,
who was a Medical Officer of the Russian Anqy and an internee at BELSEN,
and who worked with me as a doctor at BELSEN, that DOCTOR HORSTMANN had
taken MAJOR'S temperature and made a short examination. Both DOCTOR
SCHEKLAKOW and myself thought this was extraordinary as we had never
known DOCTOR HORSTMANN to examine any other patient in the Camp. I
feel convinced that DOCTOR HORSTMANN was involved in the murder of MAJOR.
2,	In paragraph 35 of my said previous Deposition sworn on the
2nd day of June 1945, it states that DR HORSTMANN'S description is
contained in my said previous Deposition. By error such description
was omitted then^ropi and the description is Heighth 1.75 metres Age 35
or thereabouts	hair Normal figure Weaffhom rimmed spectacles
and when last seen was clean shaven. Fran his speech I definitely
thought that he did not come from South Germany. I am not certain but
I believe that his eyes were blue.

FUHmES DEPOSITION OF 3HJKHILDA MEfiMELSSBIN(Female) late of Udneralni Pranen,
Svalava, G zechoslovaJcia, sworn before LLJOR SAVTIjE GEO-'FSEI CHAMPICT, Royal
Artillery, Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	Further to cry deposition dated 5th, June 1945*
2.	During 1940 I was living in Svalava, Czechoslovakia, which was at
that time under Hungarian' occupation. During that year about eight Hungarian
Shopov/ners arrived in Svalava to take over shops belonging to the Jev/s.
They were all civilians. Money was loaned to them by the Hungarian Government
in order that they could purchase shops ovaied by Jews and this money bad to be
repaid in about 5 or 10 years. Amongst these Hungarians was a man named
LUKACS. This man was a relative of the/f overnor of the District,
Carpathian, in which Svalava is situated.
3.	Soon after LUKACS arrived in Svalava he arranged evidence against a
shop owner by the name of ZOLTAH GUTTMANN so that this man was arrested and
taken to a Concentration Camp. He procured witnesses, Hungarians, to say that
Guttmann was selling goods over the maximum price. The normal procedure
in a case of this kind,was a heavy fine or imprisonment of the shop-owner
concerned, the shop remaining with the family. In this case, as LUKAC
knew the Governor, he was able to arrange it so that instead of the shop
remaining with Guttmann* s family he, LUKACS, took the shop over completely.
The shop in question was a general clothing stores by the name of "SLOVANXA”
and was in HORTHI-MIKOLAS STRA3SE. This method saved LUKACS from the
responsibility of having to repay any money.
4.	After a while LUKACS found it was impossible to replace the stock
in Guttman’s shop owing to factories being engaged on producing war materials.
He then made up evidence against other shopovmers on similar lines to that he
obt ined against ZOLTAN GOTTM&N. As a result all the stores in these shops
were taken by the police and handed to IAJKAC>i. The .oalcoiving is a list of
the shops ani owners he dealt with by these methods

WEISS, Mayer's son and M.GUTTMANN were all inprisonedL JOSE? BI IffiAU]/., v.iio
was very rich, received a heavy fine. ' These shops were later carried
on by families with what small supplies could be obtained. JOSE-1 BIBBAUM
also reopened his shop and carried on in the same way,. A lot of the clothes
obtained by LUKACS in this v/ay were sent to Hungary because he could obtain
more money for them there than in Czechoslovakia,
5.	LUKACS continued to carry on GUTTMAN' s shop until 1943. Lilce
all Hungarians he drank heavily and was very fond of women, . He made a lot
of money but spent it as fast as he made it. Then in 1943» in order to obtain
money from an Insurance Policy he staged a fake burglary. What stores he had
were hidden and he broke a window in the shop and made all the appearances
of a real burglary. He then gave the name of two Jews, Czechs, who he said
were responsible. He said that he was in the shop until 10 pm and everything
was then alright and Hie burglary must have occurred in the night. At this
time the town was under Martial Law and all offences by Jews at night were
punishable by death. One of the persons whom he named was a young bey aged
19 years, by name of R0SEN3TEIN. The other, whose name I do not know, was a
Baker, a man of 30 to 35 years and the father of 6 children. Both these men
were arrested on the evidence given by LUKACS. I was told by the relatives
of ROSENSTEIH that he died in prison from the treatment he received. He was
allowed a lawyer and this lawyer told Hie family that the police were
torturing ROSENSTEM in order to make him sign a confession. The other
man, a baker, wa# later mr=g. The responsibility -for both these deaths rests
upon LUKACS who caused their arrest.
6,	Due to this fake burglary LUKACS was able to obtain money from the
Insurance C&rpany. Public opinion then became very much against LUKAOS and
even the police began to suspect him. So much so that shortly after Hiis he
was forced to leave the district.
7.	'	My sister lias told me that she has seen LUKACS in Belsen camp
and that he is now in the Hungarian Amy. I should describe him as follows:-
Age about 35 years, height 5' 5", dark complexion, clean shaven, brown eyes
and

• X am 20 years of age ani was arrested by the Gestapo on 20th May
1944	because I am a Jew. After going to Auschwitz and Hirschberg until l6th
June 1944 I went to Bunzlau where I remained until 10th i'enruary 1945 • I
then transferred to Dora camp, Nordhausen and remained there until 3rd April
1945	when I came to Bel sen.
2>	On 10th February 1945 in company with 600 other prisoners, all
males, I conmenced the journey on foot to Belsen. Dora Camp, Nordhausen was
used as a staging point on the journey, which took eight weeks. Scharfuhrer
S.S. man SCHULZ was 2nd i/c of the transport. On 15th February 1944 the
transport arrived at Florensdorf and there about 80 of the prisoners attested
to escape. SCHULZ recaptured eight of these men and ordered an S.S. trooper,
name unknown, to shoot them. I saw these eight men shot by the trooper and
fall to the ground badly wounded. Most of them had been shot through tire
stomach. SCHULZ then took a light machine gun and finished them by firmig
shots into their heads. I know they were killed as I had a look at them
afterwards/mnt one of the dead was a personal friend of mine, a Polisn boy
by the name of Lipschutz. The bodies of the eight men were afterwards buried
on the spot by other prisoners. I know where this grave can be found. I
would describe SCHULZ as aged about 32 years, height 5ft.Dins., black straight
hair, blue eyes, dark complexion, oval face, thin lips and high forehead.

Team.
At CELLE Jail on the 30th May 1%5 HEINRICH SCHREIER
being the man referred to in the Deposition of Alexander Kurowicki
sworn on the 26th May 1%5 and being marked Exhibit 64-, was put up ^ TV'3
for identification before the following SS Men then at CELLE Jail:-

OTTO CARLESSCN alias KDLESSA
OTTO WALTER
KARL EffilRSDORP
FRANZ HOSSLER
JCHANN BESEMER
ARNOLD WILM3CHEN
WILHELM DOR
STEREN KONRAD
The result was that all the said SS Men denied that
they had ever seen or knew the man save and except as hereunder:-
(i) KARL EGERSDORP stated
"I know this man. I have seen him somewhere. I
think at BERGEN-BELSEN. I know I have seen him
somewhere. I think it was after the English
arrived and he was working there. I cannot remember
exactly. I cannot think now whether he was at
AUSCHWITZ in 194-2 or 194-3* I nay be able to
remember more if I have opportunity to think.
ARNOLD WILSCHEN worked with me at BERGEN-BSL3SN.
I am in a cell with him here. I think he must
have seen this man. If I can think anything more
about the man I will tell the Governor of the
Jail.’’
In my opinion the said KARL EGERSDORP was in bad health
which may have impaired his memory. His mental processes appeared
to be slow.
(ii) WILHELM DOR stated
"I believe that I know the man and have seen him at
some date and place which I cannot remember. I
believe the man was then a prisoner in a concentra-
tion camp"
The said HEINRICH SCHREIER was also put up on the said
date at the said Jail before certain SS Women and there is now produced
and shown to me a Statement marked "S.G.C." signed by No 1304-177
Serjeant ERIC STANLEY, 86 Special Investigation Branch, Corps of Military
Police, and the list attached, to which the said Statement refers, and
which shows the result of such putting up of the said HEINRICH SCHREIER
before the said SS Women.
3.	The said HEINRICH SCHREIER denies that he has ever been

a﻿it*	I personally eranined the said HEINRICH SCHREIHR and found
tattooed under his am the letter "A" which I am informed was a Blood Group
Marking which was tattooed on all manbers of the SS.
5.	I have made enquiries as to whether any other person or

DEPOSITION OF imiA HERZFELD (Female) late of Lobsens, Kreis Wirzatz, Poland,
sworn before Major 3AVILE GEOFFREf CHAMPION Royal Artillery, Legal Staff,
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am 27 years of age and was arrested by the Gestapo in February
1940 because I am a Jewess and taken to the Ghetto at Litzmannstadt where I
remained until 21st August 19A4. I was then transferred to Auschwitz
Concentration Camp where I remained for three days before being moved to
Waldeslust Concentration Can^, Hamburen, Kreis Celle. I remained there
until being moved to Belsen camp on 4th February 1945•
2.	Waldeslust Concentration Camp was for women only and kOO Polish
women were kept there for work. Many of the women v/orked on night shift
in an underground salt nine. In the day time others worked on road
construction work carrying stones. The camp leader was an S.o. man named
Oberscharfuhrer HENRICH REEDDEHHA3E. I was chosen as Lageraltester.
REEDDERiIASE has ordered me on several occasions to beat other prisoners out
I always refused to do so. On one occasion he beat me across the buttocks
because I refused to beat other prisoners when he ordered me to. I have
frequently seen him beat other women prisoners with his rubber stick. we
struck them across the head and all parts of the body. One day in the
winter of 1944/45 one of the women prisoners was carried into the Ca.ip
Hospital unconscious and remained unconscious for three days. I saw her
each day and other prisoners told me that REEDDEHHASE was responsible for
her condition. She was suffering from internal injuries. I would
describe REEDERHASE as aged about 50 years, 1.70 metres in height, medium
build, bald head at front, hair on sides blonde, blue eyes and red face.
An Oberscharfuhrer named FRITZ BRAlIDnSS took charge of parties
of women employed in the salt mines where they were compelled to work from
7.p.m. until 6.a.m. I have visited this salt mine but as I was lAgeraltester
I did not have to work there. I have been told by the prisoners who worked
in the mine that this man frequently beat prisoners whilst they were working
in the mine for no apparent reason. I would describe BEANBKHS as aged about
40 years, 1.70 metres in height, slim build, dark brown hair, dark eyes, and
prominent cheek-bones.	J.i"
-1-﻿4.	An S.S, viomxi named ELLI RHINE took charge of parties of
prisoners engaged on road construction vroric. Prisoners employed on tlds
work told me that RHINE frequently beat them with a rubber stick whilst
they were v/orking. About November 1944 a woman prisoner about 30 years
of age, I do not know her name, was brought unconscious into the Camp
Hospital from a working party of which RINNE was in charge. Other
prisoners in the working party told me that RHINE had struck her across
the head with a rubber stick. The woman was unconscious for several days
after which she suffered from concussion and was unable so speak. I saw
her at the Hospital every day. Before she was better she was taken away
from the camp. I believe she was taken to Belsen but I have not seen her
since ny arrival here. It was the general practice to send all sick women
to Belsen in exchange for healthy women.

sworn before Major SAVUE GEOSPRET CIA1>TI®, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff
No. 1 War Crimes, Investigation Team.
1.	I am 24 years of age and because I am a Jevr in the summer of
1940 I was taken to the Ghetto in Plonsk. I was transferred to Auschwitz
in December 1942 where I remained until I was transferred XMgX Stutthof
in October 1944. Prom there I spent short periods at Teifinger and
Schanberg before being transferred to Belsen in March 1945•
2.	I recognize No. 1 on photograph 12 as an S.S. Blockfuhrer in the
women1 s camp at Auschwitz. I have now been told that nis name is Pn^ER
WEINGARTNER. In the jamccopc autumn of 1943 I worked with my brother
Hejnech Glinovjecki in the carpenters shop at Auschwitz. At that time
we were engaged on work in the women* s camp and were marched there every
morning. At the gate of the women*s camp all the prisoners were searched
for money, jewellery or any kind of civilian food. ueingartriejr iOund in
nry brother* s pocket one sausage, belonging to the S.o. stores, five rouoles
in gold, a ring and 240 cigarettes. WEHTGARTNER took all this away and
brought my brother to the Blockfuhrer* s room. In the evening WKINGARTNER
made a report to the Camp Commander, KRAMER, who gave orders that my brother
should be taken to the Strafkommando. As this order bad to pass through
various channels before it became effective, my brother was put ^o work
with me until such time as it reached the proper authority. About three
days later WEINGARTNER searched nrj brother again and found on him a ring,
and five roubles in gold which had been given to him by a girl to buy food
for her. Some 3.3. men used to give prisoners food in exchange for such
valuables. WEINGARTNER then took ny brother to a room where he had to
lie over the seat of a chair face downwards. tVEINGARTNER kneeled on his
neck with one knee and gave him 75 strokes on the bare buttocks with a
thick stick. My brother’s buttocks were lacerated and bled. The beating
lasted about 20 minutes and WEINGARTNER then opened the door and pushed my
brother outside. He oould hardly walk and after a few paces had to lie
down on the grouni. It was here that I saw ray brother and it was then that
he related to me the details just mentioned. V& brother was unable to move
-1-﻿and I had to go to v/ork that afternoon leaving him lying there. After I
had -inished v/ork in the evening I went to the place where he was lying and
with the help of friends carried him to his block. The same evening my
brother was taken to Hospital and three days later when I went to see him
the Warden told me that he had died. I vranted to see his body but was not,
allowed to do so.
3#	I recogiize No. 3 on photograph Z^/It/2 as an internee at
Auschwitz, employed as Lager Capo in the women's camp. I have now been
told that her name is HILDE LOKBAUER. She used to wear a black triangle
on the breast of her blouse. It was common knowledge in the caup that
before being brought there she was a prostitute. I have seen her assisting
Doctors MMGELE and TAUBER when those selected for the gas chamber have been
loaded into loiries from Block 25. It was known to all in the carp that
persons sent to block 25 went to the gas chamber. She also used to search
for those who tried to hide after being selected.
^	I recognize No. 8 on photograph VV3 a Senior Capo and
Lageraltester of Canp No. 1 at Belsen. I knew him by the name of ERICH
and I have now been told that his full name is ERICH ZODDEL. About 10th
April 1945 I saw ZODDEL beat a friend of mine named TE3SLE, during the
distribution of food in the camp. TESSLE pushed forward through the
group of waiting people to try and get his food quicker from ttie Capo who
was distributing it. ZODDEL beat TESSLE with his fists%on the head and
chest,and then kicked him with his jack boots in the testicles. TE , Li
fell down and remained there for about half an hour and appeared to be
suffering from terrible pain. I then took him to the Hospital where he
was detained. I visited him every day, and on about 14th or 15th April
1945, when I went to see him, the Warden told me that he was dead. I
could not believe it so I went to TESSLE' s bed where I saw him lying dead.

following Concentration Camps, Buchenwald, Sachsenhausen, Gross-Rosen, Stuttouf,
Talfinger and Schonberg. I moved to Belsen about the beginning of March 1945•
2.	At the time of nry arrest in 1940 nry mother, father, brother, sister,
brother-in-law and nephew were all arrested also because they were Jews. On
arrival at AUSCHdTZ my mother, father, brother-in-lav; and nephew were all sent
to the gas chamber.
3.	I identify No.8 on Photograph Z/V3 an a man whom I knew by the name
of ERICH and who was a vxffyyyTgiST** Lageraltester in No.l Camp at BEL JEN. I
have new been told that his full name is ERICK ZGDDEL . I frequently saw this
man ZODDEL beat other prisoners. ZODDEL always carried a wooden stick fixed
on the end of which was a piece of iron piping and ZODDEL beat prisoners with
this stick on the head and other parts of the body. As Lageraltester he worked
as an assistant to the 33 giving orders for working parties,etc. .
4.	One day about the middle or end of March 1945 I saw ZODDEL kill
another prisoner. At 7 a.m. oln the morning in question I was with a working
party waiting to move off to work. There was another v.-orking party standing
nearby. In this working party there was a very sick man, a Polish Jew whose
name I do not know. This sick man spoke to the Capo and said that he war
too sick to go to work. I heard the Capo tell him to go to the Appel place
and the sick man walked off towards the Appel place which was behind Block 2.
ZODDEL was walking in the opposite direction and when he reached the sick man
I saw ZODDEL strike him heavily across the head with the metal end of the
stick which he always carried. There was no a parent reason for this as no
word was spoken between than. I was only about 5 or 6 metres away when this
happened and I saw the sick man fall to the ground. The blows the man had.
tJr ^

-L﻿received, had spilt open the top of his head and he was smothered with blood.

The man was baj.d and I could see ids skull was broken and was split open about
inches. Other prisoners picked the injured man up and I saw them carry him
int4 the Camp Hospital. I was out working all that day and when I returned in
the evening I went to the hospital to which the injured man had been taken.
The injured man was not there. I spoke to one of the patients whan I knew,
I cannot remember his name, and he told roe that the injured man had been brought
into the bed next to his own. He said that die man had died during the day
as a result of his injuries and tsat his deqd body had been taken away.
When I saw this man beaten by ZODDEL I had no doubt he would die owing to the
way his skull was smashed in.

Staff, Ho. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
x am 2J years of age and because I am a Jewess I was arrested in
May 1941 by the Germans and taken to the Ghetto in Plonsk. I was transferred
to Auschwitz on 15th December 1942 where I remained until I came to Belsen
\
in February 1945.
2.	I recognize Ho. 3 on photograph 19 as an flufseherin at Auschwitz
and I knew her by the-name of BOEMAHN. I have now been told that her full
name is JTJAHNA BORMAKN. In the summer of 1944 I was one of a Strafkommando
of 70 women whose punishment was to stand in the same spot all day and strike
the ground with a pick. BOEMAHN was in charge of the party and would appear
on the job about four times a day. One day she was not satisfied wa hi the
work of a group of 10 girls, to which I and a friend of none belonged,
only knew my friend by her first name of REGINA. She was aged 18 years.
BOEMAHN always had a big dog with her and on tids day she ordered the dng to
attack our group. I was the first to be bitten, on the leg, and BORMAKH
then ordered the dog to attack REGINA who was standing next to me. The dog
bit her first on the leg and as she was very weak she fell down. The dog
then started to bite and maul her all over the body starting with her legs
and working up. BOSMANN urged the dog on and when EEGIKA+ was bleedin; all
over and had finally collapsed she ordered the dog to leave off and left the
working place. Four of the prisoners later carried REGINA to the Hospital.
I used to visit her every day. She was very weak and there were open -wounds
on her body which were never dressed in any way. I believe that her body
had become blood-poisoned because the rest of her flesh had turned a dark
blue.	During ny visits she was deranged and never talked sanely.	One day
about a fortnight after the mauling, I went to see her but the nurse told me
that she had died. I have no doubt that her death was due to tne mauling
received by this dog on BORS -lH's orders.﻿I HE.. fflfTT that, the said Deponent not understanding English, tAff-

imprisoned in Radom for two months. In April 1940 I was transferred
to tlie labour camp at Starachowicze and remained there until the summer

near Danzig where I remained for sis weeks when I was transferred to
Taflingen Camp, near Stuttgart. I remained there for six months and

2.	I identify No. 8 on photograph Z/V3 as an internee Lageraeltester
in No. 2 Canp, Belsen. I have now been told that his name is ERICH SODDEL.
He wore a green triangle on his blouse which denoted that he was a criminal.
He was very brutal and always walked around carrying a wooden stick with
v/hich he used to beat other prisoners. One day in March 1945> after the
food had been served in the open In No. 1. Gasp, Belsen, I tried to get a
second helping. ZODDEL was standing next to the food containers watching
the food distribution. When I approached the food containers he jumped on
me and -with the stick which he was carrying, struck me several times, very-
hard and mostly on the head. At first I did not run away and he kept on
beating me very hard. Then I started to run but being very sick I could
not go very fast. ZODDEL ran beiiind me through the courtyard of the carp
beating me the whole time. I was bleeding heavily and blood was running
nil over nxy head and face. I was later bandaged by the carp doctor and
had to remain in bed for three days as a result of this treatment.
On many occasions 1 have seen ZODDEL beat sick internees for
no apparent reason. I have seen them fall to the ground. Come of these
victims were merely unconscious but others, i know, died, as a result of
this brutal treatment, because I have later seen their corpses collected.

DEPOSITION OP DORA SILBERBERG (Female) late of 15 Gdnska, Lodz, Poland, sworn
Before Major SAVILE GEOIDREI CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 25 years of age and Because I am a Jewess I was arrested and
taken to Tamow Concentration Camp in OctoBer 1939. I was transferred to
Mogilno in May 19L0, to a camp near Poznan in May 1941, to Bilsko, Poznan
in August 1942, and to Auschwitz in January 1943. I came to Belsen in Inrch
1945.
2.	I recognize No. 3 on photograph 19 as an S.S. woman at Auschwitz.
I knew her By the name of BOEMAHN. I have now Been told that her full name
is JOANNA BOHKANN. On 15th June 1944, whilst at Auschwitz, I was working
with a working party outside the camp. Working with me was a good friend
of mine named RACHELLA SILBER3TEIN aged 21 years, from Lodz, Poland. On
this day she felt very sick and could not walk on her own to the worldng site.
We had to assist her and on arriving at the ’working site she sat down Because
she was so weak and suffered from very severe pains. BOEMANK, who was
supervising the party, ordered ny friend to go to work im ediately. Because
my frishd could hardly speak through pain I intervened and told BOHMAKN that
SILBER3TEIN was too ill to work. BOHKANN hit me'in the face with her ist,
knocking out two of my teeth and told me to go back to work.	As I moved
away she hit me all over the Body with a thick stick which she carried.	She
then ordered a Big dog which always accompanied her, to attack oILBEKiTEUI
who was sitting on the ground. The dog grasped her leg with its teeth r.
dragged her round and round until she "finally collapsed. BOHKANL then
ordered the dog to let go of ray friend. After about 10 minutes ELL'- i LIN
recovered consciousness but laid all day on the ground. I could see no
open wounds but the leg which had Been gripped By the dog Became very
swollen and Blue-Black in colour. I had the impression that it was Blood-
poisoning. //hen we arched Back to camp 'our girls had to carry SUBERSTEIM
and on her arrival they took her o Hospital. On the foil owing day I went to
visit her -and she was very weak. She could neither speak nor eat. When I
went to see her on 17th gcarri 1944 the ,'arden told me t,.at she had. lied.﻿He said tmt the dead body was in the yard and I went there and saw a
corpse covered with blankets, I lifted the blankets and recogiised By
dead friend.
3.	I recognize No. 8 on photograph VV3 213 ^ internee at Belsen,
eiiployed in the directing of labour. I knew him by the name of HRICIt and
I have now been told that his full name is ERICH ZODDEL. About three or
four days after the English came to Belsen Camp, that is about 18th April
1945 I was passing block 201 at about 9 o'clock in the evening when I saw
MARIA KCKATKEVICZ come out of the block with a boy-friend. MANIA was a
great friend of mine. She was aged 22 years and came from Lemburg, Poland.
The boy she was with I lenow vras a Russian but I do not know his name. The
bey friend left MARIA just outside the door and she was preparing to enter
the block again. At that moment ZODDEL appeared an - I saw him pull ids
pistol from his pocket and quickly fire at MARIA from a distance of about
three metres. I heard three shots and after the third shot MARIA fell
down. ZODDEL ran away immediately. I brought some water and washed
the blood off MARIA's body and covered her with a sheet because I could
see that she was dead. She had three wounds. One at the back of the head,
one between the shoulder-blades where the bullet had gone trirou.h the body
and out through the chest, and one about five inches lower down the back.
The body lay on the ground until the next morning when some German soldiers,
guarded by an English soldier, loaded it on to a truck already containing
corpses. MARTA had told me several times that ZODDEL wanted to :;o out with
her but she had refused to do so because she did not like him as he was a
German.

near a pile of turnips. When BASCH was about three metres from the girl he
fired two or three shots at her, from a pistol he was carrying in his hand.

I saw the girl fall to the' ground, with a wound in her head, and I saw blood
streaming from it. The girl did not move and in my opinion she was killed.
The only reason I can give for this shooting was that the girl may have
attempted to take some of the turnips. I saw another girl who had been
watching the incident cAiled over by BASCH. I heard BASCH ask her if she
was thirsty and the girl said she was. BASCIi then told her she could drink

1.	I am 33 years of age and was arrested at ELonsk in 1942 'because
I am a Jew, and taken to a Ghetto there. After siz months I was transferred
to Auschwitz - Buna v/here I remained for three years before being transferred
to Dora Camp. I was transferred to Belsen on 4th April 1945.

2.	I recognize No. 4 .on photograph 1 as one of the ... guards who
was guarding our transport when I travelled from Dora to Belsen. I have now
been told that his name is OTTO CALE3SGU (KULESSA.). About 4th April 1945, I
left Dora Camp by rail for Belsen, v/ith about 3,000 other male prisoners. We
did not get any food or water. On the third day out from Dora the train
stopped for a time and we got out to relax, but had to stay in the neighbourhood
of the train. Near the rails we found some carrots lying about on the ground
and several prisoners started	to pick	them up and eat	them. At this	moment
CALEBS®! appeared and shouted	'You are not allowed to	eat anything'.	e the;:
pulled a pistol out of his pocket and I saw him shoot at one prisoner whose
name I do not know. The man	fell to	the ground. In my opinion he	was dead
because he lay on the ground,	did not	move and nobody	attended him.	We left
tiiis place about two hours later and I then noticed that the body had been moved.
I believe that it was taken to a special waggon in which prisoners who died
during the journey were placed.
3.	CALESo®! was also an S.3. guard at Belsen. A few days before
the English a rived he entered my block. No. H, wearing a write arm-band. He
ordered all Jews to 0) outside and clean up the road. He then stood near the
door inside the block and as the prisoners passed him to go outside he beat them
over the head and body with a thick stick. As I was going outside I saw one
man collapse after being beaten by GALE 3®. I do not know the man’s name but
he was a Russian. I was told later by other prisoners that the man had died.
I never saw him in my block again.

near RADOI,!, POLAlffi, svrorn before Major SAVILE GEOPEW CHAMBIOK, Royal
Artillery, Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age. I was arrested in the summer of 1940 because
I am a Jew, and taken to the Ghetto at SIARACHOWICE. In the Sumner of 1941
I was transferred to a labour camp in the same town and at the end of 1943
to AUSCHWITZ. I came to Belsen in December 1944*
2.	I recognise No. 3 on Photo 5 a-s an S3 Kitchen Chief in No.l
Kitchen at Belsen, where I was employed. I have now been told that his
name is ANCHOR PICHEN. About three weeks before the English came, a
male prisoner whose name I do not know, was working next to the wire separating
No.l Kitchen from the Men* s camp at Belsen. I was in the kitchen at the
time and I saw PICHEN leave the kitchen. Ife went up to this prisoner and
searched him. He then returned to the kitchen with some foodstuff he had
found on the prisoner. He then accused the girls working in the kitchen
that one of them had given the stuff to the prisoners, but we all denied
having done so. PICHEN then left the kitchen again and went towards the
prisoner. When about 5 metres from him he ulled his pistol out of tie
holster and shot him. He fell down bleeding from the chest and I wcis of
the opinion that he was dead. PICHEN then ordered other prisoners to take the
body away and this was done. The next day I was told by some male prisoners
viho came for food that A man shot by PICHEN was dead.
3.	About 13th. or 14th. April 1945 all girls working in No.l kitchen
were ordered by PICHEN to leave the kitchen and wait outside whilst he
attended a parade of S3 men, which was being held in the vicinity of the
S3 quarters. There was only one S3 man left behind and he did duty at the
guard tower. Many male prisoners, who were starving, took the opportunity
of obtaining turnips which were wiled up outside kitchen No.l. After about
half an hour PICHEN and an 3^ Rottenfuhrer who workfed in the kitchen
♦
returned. I do not know the name of the Rottenfuhrer except that his first
name w&s J03EF. Then they saw the prisoners, who number'd about 50,
A**
/>*
﻿stealing the turnips, they ran towards them, firing as they ran. They opened
. fire from about 30 metres. I saw many of these prisoners fall dam. When
^they, PIQlHt and JOoEP, reached the kitchen JOtEF went inside, but PlCsiai
continued firing at the prisoners who were trying to escape. To escape
from the firing we, the girls working in the kitchen, went inside the
kitchen imediately it was open. I would estimate that a total number of
men shot by PICHEN and JOSEF was between 10 and 15. After about half an hour
I saw other prisoners take away those who had been shot. The prisoners
dragged those who had been shot by the ankles which was the usual method of
taking corpses away for burial.

I am 22 years of age and I \ras arrested on 10th March 1942 at
1.
the Ghetto in Cracow and taken to Plachau Camp where I remained until 14th
January 1945• I was then taken to Auschwitz Camp where I remained for two
days before coining to Belsen.
Every day during ray stay at Plachau camp I saw S.;„ Hauptsturm-
2.
fuhrer GOTT check people on Apell for various petty offences such as being
unshaven, not standing to attention etc. When he checked such people he
gave them no time to offer an excuse and just shot them out of hand. GOTT
always carried his pistol in his hand when walking round on Apell. Some
people he shot in the head and others in the body but he always shot to kill
and if the victims were not dead he refused to allow anybody to give them
medical attention. Also at Apells GOTT always had two trained dogs which
he set on to people and I have been these dogs maul people. . I am a trained
nurse and from my experience I am able to say that every person who was shot
on Apell died. The minimum number of people shot every day at Plachau Camp
by GOTT was-JO.
*
3.	In July 1942 I returned to Plachau camp with a working party
and I saw that the whole camp was on Apell guarded by about 100 U1 rani an
S.S. men under the command of GOTT. I saw GOTT walking round the parade
picking out people and as he picked them out they then had to go in front
of the parade and undress completely. They were then made to bend over
tables, which had been placed there for that purpose, and were beaten by the
Ukranian guards with heavy rubber sticks. I saw about 500 to 1,000 people
beaten in this way, the majority being unable to wall: afterwards. The very-
bad cases were taken to Hospital but the others were forced to carry on with
their work next morning. Wren any of the guards engaged oh the beatings
appeared to be tiring GOTT himself took over.
A.	GOTT was arrested by the Gestapo about the end of October 1944
for dishonesty at this camp. I was told by other persons in ny hut that
before he was arrested GOTT shot camp leader KELOVTTCH Vlbk, and his wife
-1-﻿MARI-jG: A.

height 6ft. 2ins., wei^vt 16 stone, well cade, dark
eyes, hair straight and dark, oval face, brown

Ho, 1 ./ar Crimes Investigation Team,
1.	Further to my deposition sworn, on ?th June 1945.
2.	The Ghetto at Cracow was under the command of the Gestapo and in
March 1942 they gave orders that the Ghetto was to he cleared. The person
* .
responsible for clearing this camp Ghetto ms liauptsturrafuhrer GOTT whom I have
referred to in my previous deposition. About 3,000 people were shot at Cracow
Ghetto whilst the remainder were sent to Auschwitz. I spoke to prisoners who
had been used to bury the dead and they told me of this massacre. My brother,
JAKOB, was in Cracow Ghetto and I ms told by the prisoners that he was one of
those who were shot. I have not seen him since and I have every reason to believe
that this is true. In December 1944 working parties were sent to Cracow Ghetto
from Plaahau camp, their job being to dig up the many mass graves there and bum
the bodies. At this time the Russians were advancing and the Germans wished to
destroy all evidence. Large fires were made by the side of the graves and the
/
bodies were burnt there. I cannot say how many bodies were dug up as it was a
job to get the prisoners who were engaged on this work to talk about it, owing to
the horror of it all.
On 14th August 1942 ny sister, MIRIAM 3PRIHGGUT, and ny btother-in-
law HEINRICH SPRXNGGOT, were members of a working party engaged on work outside
the camp at Plachau. There were altogether 56 prisoners in this working party.
At night when this party returned to camp they were all searched and some 01 them
were found to be In possession of food. Orders were given by S.b. Haaptcturmfulirer
GGTT that they were all to be shot. I was told by the internee cairn? leader about
tiiis and that they were shot. I myself heard shooting at about 7 o'clock -hat
evening which was about the time that the working-party was supposed to have
arrived back, and that the shooting took place. I have not seen r.y sister or hy
brother-in-law since that date.
Second-in-command to GCTT at Flachau Concentration camp was
Untersturmfuhrer LEO JOHN. I nyself have never seen this man kill anyone, but
in the camp he had a very bad character. I haVe been told that he was 01 ten
drunk and rode tlirough the caitp at great speed on a horse. If he saw prisoners
-1-﻿*
not working or eating food he just shot theta. In fact I have been told tnat
^0 oany occasions he just -ode through the cas^ .'irlng hir pistol indiscriih.tely.
He vra.3 a very bad man. I would describe LEO JO:31 as aged about 40 yeens, hei^t
ciich below average, fair hair, fat figure, round fat face, blue eyes and female-
sounding voice.

War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 20 years of age and r/as arrested by the Germans and taken to
tiie Ghetto in Warsaw in the stunner of'1941. I was transferred to Lublin-LCaidena
Concentration Camp in April 1943 where I remained until I was transferred to
Auschwitz in July 1943* I came to Belsen in November 1944.
2.	I recognize No, 3 on photograph 5 as an S.S. kitchen chief in No. 1
kitchen at Belsen. I have now been told t:iat his name is ANCHOR PICKEN. One
day at the end of March 1945 I was working, during the afternoon, in the clothing
store. I saw PICIESN step out of Kitchen No. 1 and shoot with his pistol a male
prisoner who was attempting to steal carrots and turnips which were in a pile
outside the kitchen. The man fell to the ground and I could see he had a bullet
wound in the temple which bled profusely. PICHEN was only about 7 metres from
the prisoner when he shot and in view of the place where the bullet entered I have
no doubt that the man was killed. Five to ten minutes later I walked past the
place where the man had been lying and saw that the body had been taken away. I
later talked to other girls who had seen this shooting and they were also of the
opinion that the man was killed.
3.	Male prisoners had to take containers of food to the female camp
at meal-times and PICrUN always insisted that these should be emptied quickly
and brought hack to the kitchen. If the men were away longer than usual PICIE3'3
would go into the female camp armed with a thick stick. If he did not take a
stick vdth him he usually picked one up when he got there. The containers were
transferred from the men to the women at the gates of the female carp and these
women had to carry them to the various blocks. When they were not quick enough
PICHEN used to beat them with the stick. Many of these women w ere very weal:
and would often fall dorm under the force of the blows, at the same time the food
would be spilt all over the ground.

I am 24 years of age and was arrested on 23rd October 1939
1.
because I am a Jew and taken to a Jewish camp in Biala - Podlaska.
I t/as transferred to Suchowola Labour Camp in June 1943 and remained there
until I was transferred in March 191^2 to Maidani - Tatarskie. Prom there
I went to Auschwitz - Buna in June 1942 and remained there until I was

April
(KULESSA). About 2nd/JGGa& 1945 I arrived at Belsen from Dora. In charge
of the transport ’.ms CALESS®. As soon as we arrived we had to parade in
groups of 100 men. At a distance of four or five metres from us were piles
of carrots. As we had had neither food nor water for six days luring our
journey some of the prisoners tried to run to the carrots. I saw CALECSON
pull his pistol out of his holster and shoot at one of these prisoners.	The
prisoner, whose name I do not know, fell to the ground shot in the leg.	I
heard C ALECS On give orders to the S.S. man who was guarding ny group of
puis oners to shoot the already wounded man. Immediately afterwards X heard
two shots. When vie had to inarch on I turned my head and saw the prisoner
lying on the ground. I have no doubt that he was dead because if he had
been alive we would have been told to take him with us. Ten other
prisoners who had died of thirst and hunger during the journey were taken
from the lorries and put near the dead prisoner. These were left lying

1.	I am 24 years of age and because I am a Jewess I was arrested on
16th January 1943 and taken to Auschwitz Concentration Camp where I remained
until I was transferred to Belsen on loth January 1945.
2.	I recognize No. 3 on photograph 19 as an .3. vroman at Auschwitz.
I knew her by the name of BOHMANN, and I have now been told that her full name
is JTJAIINA 30HLIANN. One day in April 1943 I was one of a working party af
Auschwitz detailed for work at a place about 7 kilometres from the camp. One
of the women prisoners, a Pole, had not been able to keep step with t a others
because of sore and swollen feet. She was also very weak. fnen we got back
to the camp in the evening B0EI.IA13. told this woman to wfer^ouoside ine ca.:_>

then pointed at the woman1 s throat and touched it, saying to the dog * -’his is
better'. The woman was then attack again by the dog which pushed her dorm
biting, mauling and dragging her along the ground. All this time 3011AI..
was urging the dog along. After a time the dog left off its attack and the
woman lay still on the ground bleeding, and with her clothes tom. BOHMAH
called to a passing S.S. man and pointing at the woman said 'This is my work' .
She then oid.ered'four women to take the body to the hut behind Block 25 ..here
dead bodies were usually taken. I have no doubt the woman died from the
terrific mauling she received.
3.	I recofyiize No. 6 on photograph 1 as an S.S. man at Belsai.
I have now been told that his name is WALTER MELCHER. About noon on 7th
April 1945 I was standing in the queue for meals outside kitchen j.o. f in
the men's camp. There was a lorry outside the kitchen full of turnips
waiting to be unloaded. Two Hungarian girls, whose names I do not know,
started to take some of the turnips off aj£ the lorry. At this moment
KaciISR came out of tile kitchen Mid sae them. He pulled out his pistol
mvI fired in the direction of the lorry without actually aitting. Eweiybody
nearhy ran auay including the tuo HunBarian giiO., who ran in the opposite

metres from them he fired t'.vo further shots at them. Then without gding to
look at them he returned to the kitchen. Ye had to wait an hour outside the
kitchen for food, and during that time four male prisoners came and took the two
bodies away wrapped in blankets. This v/as the usual way of taking dead bodies
away.

people* always men, with a long piece of wood. Particularly have I seen
him do this at Belsen. The Camp was very overcrowded and some amount of
shoving and pushing and even perhaps hitting with the hand was necessary
by the Capos to maintain order but this man went far beyond anything that
was necessary. I only once saw a man bleed as a result of beating by
SCHLOMOIVICZ. An elderly man on one occasion fainted as a result of a
beating. I have seen SCHLOMCIVICZ hit men including old and sick men
with a piece of wood all over the body and also across the head.

3,,-orn before MAJOR SAVILE GEOFFREY' CHAilPION, Royal Artillery, Legal
Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am a Czechoslovakian subject and a Jew.
2.	I was arrested by the Germans and have been at Laurahutte, Hanover
and Belsen Camps. In all three camps I knew IGNATZ SCHLCMOIVICZ who was
a Capo. He has come into the roan during my examination and I recognise
him.
3.	He treated the prisoners in a brutal manner. He frequently hit and
beat people without cause. I have seen him hit at least ten men, some
old and some young,and injure them to the extent of mddng them bleed.
SCHLOMOIVICZ carried out beatings with a rubber cable, except that at Belsen
he used a stick. The beatings at Laurahutte were towards the end of
last year, at Hanover about February of this year and at Belsen about
March and April up to the time that the British liberated the prisoners.
L. It nay have been necessary for the Capo to use his hands to keep
order but the beatings with the piece of cable and with the stick
were out of all reason, entirely unnecessary and quite unjustified.
5.	7/hen things were very bad at Belsen and a large number of prisoners
were dying daily SCHLCMOIVICZ showed great callousness and on a parade
of prisoners said "50 people died today, unless order is kept I will see
that 100 die tomorrow”. I have never seen anybody die as a result of
beatings by SCHLCMOIVICZ and this statement by him really had no meaning
but had a bad effect on the moral of the prisoners which was already very
low owing to the horrible conditions of the comp.
6.	In Hanover about February last a Dutch boy was beaten and so injured
that he had to be taken to the hospital. I was employed in the hospital
at the time. I was told that 3CHL0MCIVTCZ was the man who hod beaten
and injured the boy but I did not see this. I do not know exactly what
the boy’s injuries consisted of but I saw him carried in unconscious
with a blanket over his body and was afterwards told by a doctor that he
-1-﻿<#•

had had a bad bea zing and raight not recover. SCHLOllCIYICZ ctuae into the
hospital after the boy had recovered consciousness and in my presence said
to the boy who was looking very bad, " You scoundrel did you want to eat ?
you are going to die and I shall give your meal to somebody else".
7. I do not know v/hether the Dutch boy recovered as two days later I
left Hanover for Belsen.

1.	I am 18 years of age and because I am a Jew I was arrested by the
Gestapo on 11th November 192*1 ani taken to a Labour Cany at Skarzisko, Poland.
There I was cancelled to work in a munition factory. From there I went to
Buchenwald and about April 192*4 I was transferred to Dora Camp. I came to
Belsen on 11th April 1945 •
2.	I identify No* 3 on photograph No. 5 as an S.S. man who was at
Dora Camp when I arrived from Buchenwald. When I was transferred to Belsen
this S.S. man was also transferred. I have now been told that his full name
is ANCHOR PICHEN.
j.	I arrived at Dora Can?) from Buchenwald in a transport of about
a	male prisoners. It was very cold weather at this time* On
arrival at Dora we were all taken for a bath. PICHEN was in charge in the
bath house and he ordered all the prisoners to sing while they washed. We
took no notice and PICHEN then said ’Who* s the Rabbi?1 He received no reply
and then left the bath-house returning with a thick rod of iron. PICH32 then
pulled one nan aside and struck him several times across the head with the iron
bar. The man was CHEMIA ZAMOSKI, a Polish Jew aged about 35 years, who came
from the same town as nyself. After PICHEN had beaten this man several times
with this iron bar he gave him a final heavy blow on the head.	The blow
smashed ZAMOSKI • s skull open and he fell unconscious to the ground bleeding
badly from the head.	All this happened inside the bath-house. PICKS* then
ordered us all outside and he kept us standing, naked, in the yard for about
fifteen minutes. The injured man was left lying naked in the bath-house during
this time. I later heard that ZAMOSKI had been taken to Hospital and three days
later I went to see him. I was told that he had died. I have not seen
ZAMOSKI since and I have no doubt that the terrific blow he received on his head
did in fact kill him. The above incident was witnessed by many prisoners one
of whom I know by name. He is PKRGAMENT,RACHMIL, also a Pole.

DEPOSITION OP LUDVIG LEHiR.VEBER (Male) late of 197, Hauptstrause, Dollar, near
Giessen, Gertnarry, sirom before:-
lt	I am 37 years of age and a German national, I was arrested in
1936 as an Anti-Nazi and.placed in prison at Giessen, I ms lated moved to
Breungesheim, near Frankfort when I remained until 15th July 1937. ?ror; tiiere
I went to tiie prison at Freien-Diez where I remained until August 1939.	1 then
went to Frankfort prison, which was controlled by the Gestapo, and was there
re-examined as to whether I should be released or sent to a concentration camp.
After four weeks there I was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp and an April
1941 was transferred to Natzweiler. In August 1943 I went back to Buchenwala
where I remained for three weeks, during which time, a working party was formea,
of which I was one, and sent to Dora Camp, Nordhausen.	I came to Belsen m
March 1945. I have never at any time been tried for any offence.
2	From 1940 to 1941 there was at Buchenwald an h. >. 'joctor
Obersturmfuhrer EESELE. This man was feared by all the prisoners m tue camp.
If prisoners left their quarters at any time when it was not allowed he would
stop them and make a note of their numbers. Later that day their numbers
would be announced over the loud-speaker and they would be told to report to
the Hospital. There they were injected with a serum as part of experiments
carried out by EISELE. Nurses at the Hospital told me about these injections
and said they were experimental but I was not able to find out wnat they were.
At this time I was assisting the block-leader -and part of ny job.was to report
the whereabouts of prisoners in the block. In this way I knew when persons
,;ent to Hospital and in the event of their death in Hospital I was informed.
!>ny of those'people whose numbers were called out over the loud-speaker nd
who went to the Hospital were reported as dead the next by. The people .-cut
to Hospital were almost always fit so it is quite certain that their death
could not have been from natural causes.
3.	From the end of ,1942 until the middle of 1943 the Oonmanhmt
at Hatzreiler was auptsturmfuhrer KRAMER. In June 1943, whilst KRAIER
was there, four prisoners escaped. One of these men was recap mired﻿^ »11 the prisoners in the cary were paraded and raode to witness the }ianginr
„ this man. KMJ05R was on parade and told everyone that they would liave
th.e pleasure of watching the otlter three men hung within the next few >iays.
He said that they had been recaptured but this in fact was untrue. 'e also
warned everyone to take note of the punishment given for escaping and said
that in the event of any other escapes the prisoner's, when recaptured, would
be treated tire same way.
4.	At Dora camp there was an Oberscharfuhrer SHOT Who was responsible
for much brutal treatment and many deaths. r>ick people unable to ork and at
the same time afrsdd to go to Hospital because they feared that there they ’would
be killed -trere ordered out of their beds by 1dm. It was not possible, in many
cases, for them to get out of bed and he ordered a German prisoner by the name
of WERNER r’CillEDLIKG- to beat them.	He was never satisfied by these beatings
administered by SCHMIEDLING- and would beat them himself. At this time I was
*
working in the office at Dora camn and was responsible for the statistics
relating to working parties. I am therefore able to state tuat to ny own
kr.o'vvledge many persons who have been beaten by SIMQH have died after admission
to Hospital. So many died in this way that I find it impossible to give a
number. The beatings were usually on the kidneys. I would describe
as follows

WILHELM SIMON, (Nick-name .TILLl) age about 35 years, about 1.80
metres in height, fair thin hair, slim build, oval face, high
forehead, pale complexion and clean snaven. e came fro
Westphalia.
5.	In September 1944 at Dora Carp 50 prisoners were arrested and
sent to the prison at Nordhausen canp for alleged sabotage. Prom tnat dai.e
onwards more were taken,mostly in threes and fours, but there was ano^er batch
of 50 until a total of 200 were in the prison. There were Russians, Germans,
French and Czechs. On 23rd January 1945 I was arrested for the same reason
and taken there. I had not cornaitted sabotage and nor had most of the others.
There were 26 cells in this prison each about 1.80 metres by 2.50 metres and
from 8 to 29 prisoners were kept in each cell. There were 15 persons in the
cell in which I was kept. Whilst at the prison these prisoners, including
rryself, were taken away for questioning. If they failed to give the answer
required at these interrogations they were beaten so much that they collapsed.
The person responsible for these beatings was Rottenfuhrer BUSSING- or BORING.
I rryself was beaten by this man.	Ths usual procedure was to take the men
mwvy after they had collapsed, put them under the shower-bath and when they had﻿revived, take the* hack for re-eyvsinatl.on. Many ware l»ter taken to the
and were not seen aeain.
Wf	At the end of February 1945 nine prisoners of the 200 I mentioned
in the preceding paragraph were hung at the prison* Prom that day sojae were
hung almost every day, until on 4th March 1945 70 prisoners were hung at once.
I witnessed this hanging by looking through a small space at the bottom of the
window where the shutters, which closed on the outside, did not obstruct the vj.ew.
Obersoharfuhrer hIMQW was present, There were two gallows each with five ropes
erected in the square and ten persons were hung at a time. The hangings
continued until 4th April when there were only eight German people left out of
the original 200 prisoners arrested. All the other Germans with the exception
of myself were then taken out and shot., I saw them leave and later heard the
shots. I was told by a prisoner working in the prison that they had been shot.

No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1. A an 21st February 19A4 I v/as called up for service in the Mungarxan
Arny and put into an unarmed working battalion. On 2Ut'a IZpy 1944, -Mi--- 411 _
other Jews, I was discharged. I was put in prison at Szeged for one day and
then taken to Berkenau camp where I ranained until 29 th May 1944, when I was
transferred to Fallersleded camp. At the end of June 19A4 I was taken to
Phil camp, near Longwy, France and remained there until the end oi August 1944
when I was transferred to Demo camp. At the end of September 1944 I was
sent to Dora camp and remained there until I was transferred to Bel sen.	I
arrived at Belsen carp on 13th April 1945*
. 2.	I identify No. 2 on photograph 1 as an S.S. man at Dora camp. I
have now been told that Ms full name is THEODORE WAGNER. Just before I left,
Dora camp there was a parade and I saw 40 people on that parade beaten ana.
kicked by V/ASIER.	The people who fell to the ground he kicked in the back
and stomach. I was one who was beaten. WAGNER carried out the beating

with a rubber truncheon and beat me so badly on the head and body that I was
deaf in my right ear for three weeks. On the Sunday following tMs incident,
I saw another ?6 people who were on parade beaten by vVAGHER. He never gave
any reason for these beatings and so far as I know there ms none. I cannot
say "if any of these people who were beaten were seriously hurt.
3.	I June 1944, while I was at Fallersleded Camp, I saw an S.S. •	4
Oberscharfuhrer named iMB-rft, beat a Rumanian J engaged about 50 years,
used a rubber truncheon. After the beating I saw that the Jew was bleeding
from the mouth. He ms removed to Hospital where he was detained for a week.
The reason for this beating was that the Jew ms noisy at meals. An internee
Doctor, whose name ms JAEGER, and who worked in the Hospital where tMs Jew
had been sent, told me that the Jot would never recover from the beating he
had received from §$£? After I arrived at Thil camp I was told by a
Rmhel-
prisoner, I do not know Ms name, that ^5-^ had again beaten tMs Rumani an
Jot and that he had been admitted to Hospital. At the end of August, alter
the camp had moved to Demo, I happened to visit the Hospital and saw the﻿Rumanian Jew there. About six weeks after the camp had moved to Dora it
was officially announced by the S.S, that the Rumanian Jew had died.
I v/ould describe	as aged about 35 years, height 6ft., weirht 80 kilos,
straight brown hair, dark eyes, fresh cccplexion, round face, clean shaven,

DEPOSITICSJ OP RUTH LOWEJ|jTEIN (Female) late of 66 Friedenau Kaiserallee, Berlin,
G-ermany, sworn before Major Savile Geoffrey CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff,
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 25 years of age and was arrested in September 1942 by the
Gestapo because I am a Jewess. I was taken to Yagala Camp, Estonia where I
remained until December 1942 when I was removed to Revel Prison, Estonia. In
December 1943 I was sent to Ereda Camp, Estonia and remained there until August
1944 when I was sent to Lagedi Camp, Estonia. In .September 1944 I went to
Stutthof Camp, near Danzig and remained there until October 1944 when I was sent
to Oxenzoll Camp, near Hamburg. On 3rd April 1945 I left there and came to Belsen.
2.	While I was at Ereda Camp I worked in the Hospital. In February
1944 I was told by an internee, whose name I cannot remember, that Samtator ERKki
SC1IARFETTER had shot a Polish boy aged 18 years, through the neck. he had then
picked the boy up and put him in the tent where all corpses were kept. About an
hour later the boy who had been shot came into the Hospital and I saw him. Ouung
to the check kept on corpses I had to report the boy's presence at the Hospital.
I saw the bullet hole in the boys neck. Later SCLARFETTER came to the hospital
and took the boy away.	I pleaded with him to spare the bey* s life but 3CIIAHFET2ER
said that he must die.	He took the boy to the tent, into which he had previously
put him, ard then shot the boy in the back of the head. I was standing quite near
to the tent when the boy was shot. I later saw this boy's documents which
purported to show that he had died from the effects of Typhus. The reason why
the boy was shot was because he had excreted behind one of the blocks instead of
using’the latrine. I would describe SCHARPETTER as aged about 38 years, 5ft.lOins.
in height, weight 70 kilos, pale complexion, fair hair, grey-blue eyes, thin iace,
slim build. Hair was close cropped. His home was Danzig.
3	At Lagedi canp I also v/orked in the Hospital. I remember about
the end of August 1944 a Hungarian girl being brought in suffering from a bullet
wound in the face. In ny opinion this wound was caused by a 'Dum-Dum* bullet.
It had affected almost the whole of the right hand side of her face, including aer
eye. The girl's sister, whose name I do not know, told me that the reason for
the shooting was because the girl had wandered away from a working party to find﻿some potatoes and had been shot by one of the guards. Soon after the "irl had
been admitted to Hospital 3CHMiF2TTER came and was angry because she still lived.
presence he injected 'RIVAKOL' (a poison) into the girl's heart and sne
•died shortly afterwards. .Then SCHAHFETTER injected this girl with poison he was
assisted by Sanitator BAHR. I would describe BAKU as aged about 45 years, 6ft. in
height, 90 kilos in weight, ruddy complexion, dark hair' -ath bald patch on top,
dark eyes, thick lips, big fat face, double chin, very strong. He was a cabinet-
maker and lived in Schleswig-Holstein.
2^	‘ in November 1944, while at Oxensoll carip, near Hamburg, I saw
Lagerfuhrer THOMAS HSNNINGSCK shoot two Russian internees with a pistol. HHlilK&SGN
was about 20 feet away from them when he fired, hitting one in the leg and the other
in the abdomen. Both of these men were removed to Hospital. I was later told Dy
an internee that the man v/bo had the wound in the abdomen had died. HH3HIHGS0I.
was always practising shooting with his revolver and I can think of no reason why
these two men were shot except that they provided more practice for HEKNMG'XH.
I do not know the names of the two men who were shot. I would describe
as aged about 30 years, height 6ft., straight brown hair, small pig-like blue eyes,
pale complexion, round face, slim build. He suffered from Venereal Disease.
On 25th February 1944 I was working in the Hospital at Ereda Camp,
Estonia. On this date I saw six bodies brought into camp. All had bullet wounds.
I was later told by an internee, whose name I do not know, that these six persons
had formed part of a transport of 800 sick who had been taken to Kothla Station
for transport to Riga or Auschwitz. This transport included men and tiomen. On
arrival at the station fee people had had to jump from the lorry. These six
were unable to jump and had been shot by Obersanitater SATTKBS. I would describe
3ATTKU3 as aged about 50 years, height 5ft.l0ins., brown hair, round face, pale
complexion - yellow tinged, big built and corpulant.

1.	I am 29 years of age. In January 19¥) the Germans converted
Lodi, where I lived, into a Ghetto and I was held there until about June 1944
•♦•••••••eeeeseww
when I was transferred to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. After about a fortaig^it
at Auschwitz I was transferred to Belsen.
2.	I first saw HELENA HOTTER in Block 205 at Bel sen during the
winter of 1944/5• I lived in Block 205 myself and HOPPER was Block Altester.
All the prisoners from Block 205 including myself were later moved to Block 224
where KDFPER continued as Block Altester. A few weeks before the British
arrived HDEPER became a camp policewoman. I have heard from other prisoners
who have known HOPPER for some time that she is a Polish Jewess.
3.	i have frequently seen HOPPER beating other women prisoners
with her	or a wooden stick, both in the block and on Apell. One evening
in February 1945 I was sick and went to the Hospital to get some medicine.
I did not return to Block 205 until about S.p.m. It was dark at the time and
I Biased ny food issue. I went to see HOPPER in the Block Altester' a room
a»i asked her for ny ration. HOPPER said there was no food for me and I told
KOPPKT? that I had missed ny ration and wanted food. HOPPER then beat me on
the face with her hands and she gave me a heavy blow in the face knocking me
unconscious. I recovered consciousness about three hours later and other
prisoners then told me that HOPPER had been kicking me whilst I waa laying on
the ground. Since this beating I have suffered from frequent headaches and

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
A BLOCK LEADER NAMED HELENA KOPPER.
DEPOSITION OP HALINA PURSTENBEHG (Pemle) late of 29 Siantawicta, Plock,
near Warsaw, Poland, sworn before Major SAVTLE GEOFPBEY CHAMPION, Royal
Artillery, Legal Staff No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age and in autism 1942 I was moved with other
Jews living at Sientawicsa to Starachowice, a small town reserved for Jews
only. In autism 1943 I was moved into a labour camp on the outskirts of
Starachowice and made to work in a munition factory. In the late summer of
1944 I was moved to Berkenau where I remained until I came to Belsen in
November 1944*
2.	Whilst at Belsen camp I was in Block 2? and the assistant
Block Alt ester was a Polish Jewess named HELENA KOPPER, I was cleaner for
this block. We later moved to Block 205 and after that to Block 224; in
both these blocks I acted as a cleaner. KDFFER became Block Altester in
Block 205 and later in Block 224 can?) policewoman for a week, relinquishing
her job as Block Altester.
3#	i have frequently seen KOPPER beat other woman prisoners. These
beatings usually took place in the block round about the time that Apella
were being held. She beat prisoners because they did not hurry on to Apell
or because they hunried away to their blocks after Apell. She also beat
prisoners for trifling offences such as speaking or moving on Apell. She
usually beat prisoners with a stick but at other times a leather strap was
used, or she picked up anything and beat the prisoners on the head and all
parts of the body. When she picked on someone for a beating she beat them
nga-in ami again. On several occasions when an Apell was on she made old
woman kneel on the ground, usually for speaking or something of that nature.
rarely	a young person kneel - it was always old women. Apart from
the incident mentioned in paragraph 6 hereof I cannot remember any other
specific instance directly involving death due to beatings administered oy
KOPPER. i know, however, that KOPFER beat several other women, who
subse<*iently died, but I am not able to say whether the deaths were due to
beatings or not. I believe that the beatings certainly contributed to
death. The victims were starved and in ill health at the time of the

On one occasion in January 1945 during very cold weather
iFPSR made a Polish Jewess aged about 45 years, 1 do not know her name,
•	'f'o©wsshnu yrCtfj -)•:«,>» Atasittuo -r '	. jbe±%B»ae *
kneel on the ground for half an hour. This was because the woman had

spoken while on parade. Tiro S.S. women on the parade said, after the
woman had knelt a short time, that it was enou^i but KOFPER said 'She
must learn to stand at Apell' and made the old woman continue to kneel.
•	«
Sometimes when she was in a bed mood she came into the room and beat
women for no apparent reason.
• * »	..	'.A » ’ j
5.	• Once when KDFFKH was camp policewoman I saw other Block
Altesters beating her. I asked then what it was for and they told me that
they had beaten her because she had given information to the S.S. that they
were in possession of jewellery, even though they were not. This was
apparently an attenqpt to get them into trouble. I was told that the
S.S. instead of finding jewellery on the Blockleadera had found a gold
and locket on KDEPER and that they had told the Blockleaders to
beat her. She was later put in the bunker. The locket she wore had
a photograph in it of an S.S. man named BQMAN SV1STAL with idiom KOPFER
kept company. I have seen them in bed together.
6.	I remember an occasion when there was a Polish Jewess aged about
JO years sick in the block. I cannot remember this woman's name. This
woman missed her food one day and she went to KDFPER and asked her fat it.
Instead of giving her food KOTPER beat her again and again over the head
with a leather strap. When the woman fell to the ground unconscious
KDFPER continued to beat her. The woman remained unconscious for an
hour and after regaining consciousness kept lapsing into unoonaoiousness.
She suffered from concussion. Three or four days after she had been
beaten by KDFPER this woman died. I saw this beating, and I saw the
wanan die. I also saw other prisoners take the woman's dead body out
of the block..
7#	i saw at the office of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team
Belaen, on 15th June 1945, a woman whom I recognise as the said HELENA

Hi THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
A 3LOCKLEADER NAMED HELENA KOFER.

DEPOSn-IOI OP PAULA S^NGBER (Pemale) late of 46, Pilsudskiego, Staracliovdce, Poland,
sworn before Major SAVILE GEOPPHEY CHAlffiiai, oyal Artillery, Legal Staff, Ho. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
J}j^eoo
1,	I am years of age and because I am a J-onyr.ire I was arrested by
K nuz.
the Gestapo on 28th October	and placed in a labour camp at Staracncnvice
where I remained until Jhd July 1944. I v/as then transferred to Berkenau and
on 3rd October 1944 I came to Belsen.
2.	I first met HELENA KOPSR on 3i*d October 1944 when I arrived at
Belsen.	KOPER had travelled in the sarae transport as me from Auschwitz but
I did not see her on the my. Within about a month of my arrival at Belsen
KOPSR became assistant blockaltester in Block 2? of the women's section of
Belsen camp. I was in the same block. In December 194A KQFER became block-
altester of Block 205 and later at block 224. All the prisoners in block 2?
moved to blocks 205 and 224. I was a clerk in each of these blocks and Shared
the blockaltester's room vdth KQPER. KOFER became a lager policewoman about
the end of February 1945. She only held this post - or a few days.
^	X Saw KOPER beat other women prisoners practically every day,
usually with a leather belt but I have seen her .using a wooden stick. These
beatings usually took place on Apells and KOPER picked on those who did not
move quickly enough or who did not stand properly in line etc. When she
beat anyone she struck than again and again on all parts oi the body. I Have
often seen her beat sick women who were not fit to attend i^pell often because
they complained to her.
4.	I remember one day in January 1945 ^ °bd woman on Apell nns
sick and tired and could not stand properly. KOPER made her kneel down to
attention. It was very cold at the time and there was snow on the .ground.
An S.3. woman attending the Apell, I do not know her name, asked why the old
lady was Reeling and said that it was wrong to make her kneel. KOFER
objected and told the S.S. woman that the old lady must continue to Imeel
as she did not obey orders. The woman was left kneeling for about half an Hour.
I saw all this take place.
X heard from other prisoners that KDFER did excuse prisoners
from attending Apell but they had to give her food for doing so.
-1-
I have seen﻿KDF3K bring extra food into the room I shared vdth her and consume it herself.
I believe t	i^en to her by other-prisoners for excOAing them ffom
^Rending Apell. KOPdR was responsible for distributing the food fairly among
other prisoners in her block but I saw that she always kept - or herself more
that she was entitled to have. KDFER disposed of some of this extra food to
other prisoners in exchange for raargarine etc.
6.	I have been told'by KOPER that she acted as a spy for the i,3.
and it was generally known by most prisoners that this was so. She reported
to the 3.S. things she had seen other prisoners doing and such prisoners, if
they had :ione wrong, were then mmished by the 3.3.
7.	KOPER kept company with an 3.S. man named ROMAN SVT3TAL and this
man used to visit the block and sleep with KDPER in her bed. I had to sleep
in the'same room and saw them in bed together on many occasions. SVToIAL left
Belsen a few weeks before the British troops arrived.
7.	Since Belsen camp was liberated by the British 1 have seen IIELSI'A
KOPER in No. 3 Camp. I would describe KOPER as aged about 35 years, height -5ft.
5ins., broad build, stout, dark brown hair, full face, brown eyes. She has told
me that her father is a German Aryan and her mother a Polish Jewess. She also
said that her husband served with the German Amy and that her two sons were in

DEPOSITION OF EVA KHTSTTKA STOJOVSKA (Fanale) late of Warsaw, Poland, sworn before
Major SAVILE GEOFFREy CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team.
1.	I am 31 years of age and I was arrested on 17th May 1943* by the
Gestapo, because I belonged to a Polish Undergrcund organisation. I was confined
for six weeks in a dark cell in Warsaw prison and I was then sent to Lemburg
prison where I remained for fire months. I was then transferred to Berkenan
Concentration Camp and on 4th December 1944 to the men* s camp Auschwitz where I
remained for two weeks. I was then sent to Cracow prison for six weeks and I
came to Belsen in January 1945. I was tried before a political court at Lemburg
and sentenced to be confined to a concentration camp for an indefinite period.
2.	Whilst at Berkenau I was in Block 12 and HELENA KOPPER was in
Block 18 which was opposite to ny block. I was warned by SOFIE MALTS, who ms
secretary of Block 18, never to say anything in the presence of KOHPER as she,
KOPPER, was a spy working for the S.S. MALTS was later sent to Ravensbmok.
Whilst at Berkenau I was told by many other prisoners that KOPPER had given
information to the S.S. and that many prisoners haul been punished as a result.
3.	When I arrived at Belsen HOPPER was Block Altester of Block 205
and later of Block 224* She later became a camp policewoman. I myself was
Block Altester of Block 201 but after being in Belsen for a month I was taken ill
with Typhus and was sick for two and a half months. Whilst sick I lived in
Kitchen 1 Block and then about the beginning of April 1345 I moved to the
Maternity Block.
4.	About the end of March 1945, whilst in Kitchen 1 Block, Belsen,
I saw through the window the woman HOPPER together with about 40 other women
Block-leaders. The other Block-leaders were beating KOPPER with their hands
and I saw her fall crying to the ground. The others then left her and she got
up and went to the Hospital. I asked some of the other Block-leaders what was
the mtter and they told me that HOPPER had reported to the S.S. that they, these
other Block-leaders, were in possession of Jewellery. This was an offence in
the camp. A search was made of all the Block-leaders by two S.S. women whom I
identify aa No. 5 on photograph 22 and No. 6 on photograph 22. I have now been
told that their respective names are HEHTA EHLEHT and ELISABETH VOLKHiRATH.
-1-﻿Nothing vu found as a result cf this search and they then searched KDH’ES
herself and found that she was wearing a gold chain and locket. In ahlch was
tograph of/S.S. at Belsen Canp. Upon finding this either VQLCTfRATH or
KHT.gBT told the other Block-leaders that KDPPER had glren then false information
and that they could beat her. The other Block-leaders then set about KOFPER.

Oc/afa-A
1.
During the time I was in Berkenau Concentration Ceng), from Mgr
1943 to December 1944 I saw many selections for the gas chamber, especially during
the period May to September 1944 when they were held practically every day without
exception. I saw the following persons take part in these selections: -
S.S. DOCTORS.
MENGELE, KLEIN anl RHODE.
S.S. MEN.
Commandants KRAMER & hbsst.et? and Rapportfuhrer
TAUBER.
S.S. WOMEN.
HANDEL, DKECHSLER, HASSE and BRANDED.
2.	In addition to the ordinary type of selections in the camp
Rapportfuhrerln BRANDED used to visit blocks and sort out the sick for the gas
chamber. I was in Block 12, and later Block 7, and BRANDED vised to visit thesw
blocks to make selections. She Just looked at the prisoners in the block, sorted
out the sick ones and took than to Block 25. It was general knowledge in the camp
that all prisoners sent to Block 25 went to the gas chamber. After prisoners
werw taken to that block I never saw any of them again. I have seen lorries go
to Block 25 and pick up batches of condemned prisoners and take them to the
buildings which I knew to be the gas chamber and crematorium. I have also seen
BRANDED beat many women prisoners who were sick and whom she selected for the gas
chamber. She beat them in the block before taking them to Block 25 usually with
her	or with a stick. She also used to visit the bath-place in Berkenau and
if anyone moved when she came in she would beat them as they stood naked. I
would describe BRANDED as aged about 30 - 35 years, 5ft.Sins.in height, slim build,
black hair and dark eyes.
Hiilat at Berkenau I also knew an S.S. Aufseherin RUPERT who was
in charge of the clothing store. I saw this woman beat female prisoners on the
pretext, v«r often teceuse they did not et«vl properly to ett«tion
eh. approeehed. She beet t>«i -ith her >««*. end	. .hip « the heel
-1-﻿and other parts of the body. I hare seen her beat prison era in the clothing
be, which Z had to visit from time to time, and out in the caiqp. BUPERT
also often searched the blocks and took away food and any othaf property sent
to prisoners by their relatives, I would describe BUPERT as aged about JO
years, 5ft.Sins, in height, slim build, black hair, dark eyes and unpleasant
appearance.
I identify No. 2 on photograph No. 5 as an Un terse barfuhrer and
Blockfuhrer at Belsen. I have now been told that his name is WALTER OTTO.
One day in January 1945, five or six days after uy arrival in Belsen, I went to
Block 213 .which was empty in order to get a bed. There were some beds outside
213 and as I was without one I obtained permission from the Lageraltester to
fetch one. An I began to move the bed OTTO approached me. He was carrying
a big stick. He accused me of stealing the bed and without giving me a chance
to answer beat me again and again across the upper arms, shoulders and back
with the stick he was carrying. I wan very badly bruised.
5.	Block 201 in which I lived, was divided into two parts each of
which had its own blockleader. I was one blockleader and a Hungarian Jewess,
aged about 50 years, was the other. Two days after the incident above OTTO
came in Block 201. He was again carrying a big stick. The Hungarian Jewess
had a bed in the block and OTTO asked her from where she got the bed. She
told him she had brought it in from outside with the permission of the Lager-
altester. OTTO then set about the woman and beat her across the head, face,
shoulders and back with his stick. She was knocked to the floor and he
continued to beat her whilst she was on the floor. After OTTO had left the
block I helped to lift the woman into bed idlere she had to remain for several
weeks. I believe that some of her ribs were broken as she could not breathe
properly. She also had cuts on the face and head and her body was swollen and
badly bruised. I have heard from other prisoners that OTTO frequently beat
prisoners for very little reason but these are the only two incidents I can
speak of from my own knowledge.

AND
A BLOCK LEADER NAMED HELENA KOPFER.
EXHIBIT " >3/

War Crimes Investigation Team,
1.	I am 42 years of age and in the summer of 1941 I wan compelled,
under orders from the Germans, to go to a Labour Camp at Starachowice where I was
employed in a munition factory. I remained there until the winter of 194-3 when
I was moved to Auschwitz Concentration Cany. I came to Belsen in February 194-5•
2.	I first saw HELENA KOFFER in Block 2? at Belsen Cany where KQFPER
was Assistant Block Altester, I was in Block 27 myself. I later moved with
KQFPER and other prisoners to another block, the number of which I cannot remember,
and later to Block 224. At the second block we went to KDIPER was Block Altester
and she also held this position in Block 224. For a few days shortly before the
British troops arrived KOFFER was Lager policewoman.
One day in February 1945 I attended an Apell of which KQFPER was
»
in charge. It was cold and there was snow on the ground. The Apell lasted
about two hours that day. After about an hour on this Apell I felt very cold
and moved my position sligitly. KQFPER then came up to me and beat me across
the and body with a leather strap she wan carrying. The beating was very
painful and made me cry. After the beating KOFPER made me kneel down in the snow
for about an hour. Whilst I was kneeling down an S.S. woman, whom I identify as
No. 5 on photograph 22 and whose name I have been told is HERTA EHLEET, came up
and spoke to KOIPER.	She said to KOFPER 'It is enough and KOFPER replied 'No
she must stay there.	She did not stand straight*. I had to carry on kneeling.
4*	At another Apell in February 1945, of which KOFPER was in charge,
there was a Polish woman named FISCHER, aged about 40 years, standing on parade
without any shoes. She stood in her stockings. There was snow on the ground
and the weather was damp and cold. KOFFER came up to the woman FISCHER and said
•fly are you not working? You should be with the working parly*. FISCHER
replied 'I have no shoes'. The Apell was at 8.a.m. and working parties had
gone out at 7.a.m. KOFPER, without saying any more, then beat FISCHER with a
leather belt, again and again across the head and other parts of the body.

•Ip﻿all that happened. Whoa FISCHER returned to her block, No, 224, she we* ill
to lie dam. She remained ill from then onwards until about three
Greeks later when she died, I was present when she died end I saw her dead
body carried out of the block by other women prisoners. She had received no
medical attention.
5,	On another occasion in February 1945, just before Apell, I was
in the block when KQFFER ordered everyone outside on Apell. There was a sick
Polish woman who was suffering from heart trouble and swollen limbs. I do not
know this woman's name but she was about 35 years of age. She was lying on
the floor as there were no beds.	In my presence this woman told KOEFER that
she felt too ill to attend Apell.	KOFPER imaediately started to beat her with
a leather strap and continued to do so until the woman got on her feet. KQFFER
then made her go outside to attend Apell. During Apell the woman collapsed on
the ground unconscious. There was snow on the ground at the time and the Polish
ww>w was left lying in the snow for two hours no one being allowed to touch
her because Apell was on. After Apell I saw other prisoners carry the
unconscious woman to the Hospital block. Three days later other prisoners told
me that the woman had died and I did not see her again.
6.	I have seen KQFFER beat other women prisoners with a wooden
stick or a leather belt every day at Belsen. She beat them on the head and
all parts of the body for trifling offences and often for nothing at all. As
she walked through the block she would beat woman prisoners without reason.
ftp a number of occasions I have seen KDFPER beat other women prisoners until
they ware unconscious and many of her victims had to be taken to Hospital
for treatment.

1.	I am 21). years of ags and I was arrested, because I am a Jew, on
15th July 1943 and taken to Bunslau Labour Camp. In May 1944 this Camp was
converted to a cono entration cany and 1 remained there until 10th February
1945 when I was transferred to Dora Camp and later to Ellrich. I came to
Belsen on 10th April 1943*
2,	Whilst at Bunslau Cany I knew a Capo by the name i STEOER. This
man STEOER frequently beat and ill-treated prisoners for no reason at all and
for this purpose he was always armed with a very heavy wooden stick about one
metre in length and about 10 centimetres in width. These beatings were
*	i-»	70 y.'7.	■ r 4 ’ ,1 -Vy. *
given without any orders from the Cany S.S., but when the S.S, did require
prisoners to be punished they always gpt STEUER to do the flogging. On
these occasions STEOER instead of giving the amount of strokes ordered by
the S.S. always gave more than he was ordered to give.	One morning
about January,Apell, a friend of mine was so weak and ill that
he fell down. My friend's name was GABRIEL SZHJLOWSKI, a Polish Jew.
STEUER immediately came up and beat ny friend as he lay on the ground.
He beat him so rmi^h that I cannot really say what parts of the body were
not hit. The reason for this beating was, I suppose, because SZTDLOWSKI
did not stand up on Apell. After Apell was over SZTOLOWSKI was taken to
Hospital where he remained for four days.	I was allowed to visit him and
I did so on three occasions.	I found that my friend had been beaten so
m,„h that he was unable to eat or move. At the end of these four days
a Conmission arrived at the cany to select people unable to work and ny
friend was one of those selected. All prisoners selected were takoi to
Auschwitz. I have since seen several frtenda who were at Auschwitz and
thqy have told me that sick persons taken to Auschwitz were always sent to
the gas chamber. I have no doubt that ny friend, SZIDLOffSKI, did in fact
meet his death this way and the responsibility rests with STEUER as it was
through tha besting ny friend received from STEUER that he was made unfit
for work.

I am 32 years of age and I was arrested on 3rd March 1942,
because I am a Jew, and taken to Blechhammer Canp, Upper Silesia, and
at the beginning of April 1942 to Bunslau Camp where I stayed until February
191*5. I was then transferred to Dora Camp and I came to Belsai cm 13th
April 194-5.
2.	During my stay at Bunslau Casp there were two Capos, one
named WALTE STEUER and the other SILBI^R. When the Camp changed from
a Labour Can?) to a Concentration Camp the number of Capos was increased
to five. During the time the camp was a Labour Camp STEUER was the chief
Capo. STEUER did not beat me but the reason for this was that I always
managed to get potatoes or bread and these articles I shared with STEUER.
I used to steal these articles from a kitchen and the cellar. Other men
did the same thing and they were never beaten by STEUER. I have seen
STEUER beat two friends of mine, one named SCHOEL LIPSCHUTZ and the other
SCHORNSTEIN. LIPSCHUTZ was beaten by STEUER some time at the
beginning of 1944. This took place on Apell at 6.p.m. and STEUER was
assisted at this beating by SILBIfER. Between them they inflicted about
a hundred strokes on LIPSCHUTZ because STEUER had seen LIPSCHUTZ giving
bread to a German civilian in exchange for a pair of shoes. For this
beating STEUER used a rubber truncheon about two feet long and one inch
in diameter. LIPSCHUTZ was beaten on the body and buttocks and I saw
him walk off the parade ground after the beating doubled up. I later
saw hlny/iaJt^in the block and his back and buttocks were black with bruises.
I applied cold compresses to his back and he had to go to work next morning
as usual. I do not know whether he suffered any permanent injury as the
result of this beating.

1.	I am J2 years of age and, because I am a Jew, I was arrested on
3rd March 192*2 and taken to Blecbhammer Can?), Upper Silesia where I stayed
until the beginning of April 192*2. I was then transferred to Bunslau Camp
and remained there until February 1945 when I was sent to Dora Canp, I
arrived at Belsen Camp on 13th April 1945•
2.	In February 1945 I was one of a transport of about 600 - 700
male prisoners who had to march from Bunslau Camp to Dora Can?). This
transport was under the command of Unterscharfuhrer SCHULZ. I remember
that on 2SS the -third day of our march we stopped at a large farm, near a
village, about 50 or 60 kilometres from Bunslau. We were accommodated in
four large barns and slept there overnight. On the next morning when we
paraded for our rations about 100 men were missing. I saw SCHULZ go toward
one of the barns and I shouted to my comrades who were inside to get out.
The first one of ny friends to appear was a man named LIPSZIZ, Schoel. As
he appeared in the doorway SCHULZ ordered a guard to shoot him. The guard
shot without taking aim, missing ny friend and hitting the wall. SCHULZ
was very angry and, taking the rifle from the guard, shot LIPSZIZ in the
shoulder. LIPSZIZ asked him for mercy but SCHULZ fired another three or
four shots at him and he fell to the ground. SCHULZ then approached the
barn and as he did so about 15 - 20 mm ran out. SCHULZ called on them to
stop and he and a guard named 0RZESZEVSKI (Luftwaffe, and a Volks Deutsche -
German by choice) opened fire on them killing five. The names of these five
were SZ0RSZTEIN, IMMERGLIEK, SUVEX, FIEGENBLATT and LIBERMAN who came from
Dcmbrova in Poland. I know that these five men and LIPSZIZ were dead because
I to remove the footwear from their bodies. I remember that LIPSZIZ was
shot through the bead but I cannot remember in what part of the body the others
were shot. I buried all six men in one grave but was not allowed to mark it.
If necessary I could find this grave again. Soon after the burial we again

commenced to march.	** ***﻿Later I saw SCHOfWSTEIN in the Block and he told me that he had been beaten

that the number of people in the cany were approximately 250 to 500.	Euring
the whole of this period only 47 people died of all causes. I know this

motor car driver, of SOSNOWIOZ, Warengasse 5, POIA. «D
duly swor*n states;
I am S2 years of age, of polish Jewish nationality, horn at WOL- ROH,
Poland. !Jy pemahent home is 308N0WICTZ, Warengasse 5. I am at
present living at BBL3EN, Camp II, Block 18.
1.	i was imprisoned in BUHSLAU Camp fraa April 1 42 until
February 1945. The Camp was originally a labour camp until May
1944 when it was turned into a Concentration Camp. With this
change a new Commandant took over command of the Camp. He was
named SCHRAM! IEL •
2.	With the arrival of this man, SCHRAilMSL, the treatment of
the prisoners immediately improved. The Camp was kept clean and
prisoners were not ill-treated.
3.	prior to the arrival of SCEiAlS1SL, a Capo named WALTBR
STEUER was resj^onsible forthe discipline of all the prisoners in
the Csb®. With the arrival of SCuRAHOL, STEUER was reduced to
the position of second CAPO, and was afraid to ill treat prisoners.
4.	jn my x^revious statement I said I'had not seen anyone
seriously hurt by being beaten by STSUER. By that, I meant that
as I have no medical knowledge I was unable to describe anyone’s
injuries as of a severe and lasting nature. I am of the opinion
that SCHOEL LIP8CHUTZ was seriously hurt when he was given one
hundred strokes with a rubber' truncheon by STEUER. He was very
dazed, his body was very swollen and black and bruised in many
-Diaces, and he was bleeding from various cuts caused by the blows.
5.	The beating SCEOSTTSTSIN got from STEUER, described in ray-
previous statement, was carried out by STEUER using a wooden stick
about the size of the average walking stick. The blows inflicted
were severe and obviously hurt SCII0RHST3IN very much.
I have seen so many beatings during y detention in
Camps that I did not always pay much attention to them and tj-ereiore
find if difficult to recall, in detail, the effects of the beatings
on the victims. Judged by normal civilised standards, the
treatment by STEUER of the prisoners was brutal end cruel.
7.	on the march from BUNSLAU to DORA my friend .IPSCHUTZ
wasshot dead by SCHULZ, an S3 Scharfuhrer, because, after a nignt s
r st we were unexpectedly ordered to parade early in tne morning.
When LIP3CHUTZ tfas walking fran the barn in which he had slept ohe
ni-ht to get on uarade, SCHULZ went up to him and asked him why he
had tried to hide. LIP9CHUTZ said he did not hide but had oeen
sleeping, and was then shot. SCHULZ was about five to ten reties
away from me -hen he killed LIPSCHUTZ. He shot him witn a nfle.
I prepared LIPSCHUTZ’ body for the grave._ He was burieu vnere
he was killed, near BUNSLAU. I could point out tne grave if I
were there.
a	acHORHSTEIN was shot by an S3 Guard at the same place
nnd same time.* I did not see who shot him. The other prisoners
carried the body to a .position ne-r to the body of LIPSShhTZ. I
did not aaminlster the last rites to SCH0HH3TBIH. There wore stout
five or six risoners killed by shooting at the time; tney were a 1
buried ne-r BUNSLAU where they were shot. T1?ff
were only wounded and we brought them along with us in a hana cart
and then took them to GERLIZ Camp.

1#	I am 57 years of age and because I am a Jenr I iras arrested by the

At the end of that‘time I' was sent-to Dora Camp where I remained for about sin months

During the time I was at Bunslau Camp there was a Jewish Capo
2.
r^am^ WALTE STEUER. He held the position of Chief Capo there. I was enployed
in the as a bricklayer's mate. During the time I was in this canp I was
beaten at least once a day by STEUER with a wooden stick. This stick was about
2ft. 6ins. long and about one inch in diameter. I was beaten on the head and
body and on many occasions have become unconscious as a result of these beatings.
I never received medical attention and after these beatings had to continue working.
^ STEUER used to beat me until I fell to the ground and administered these beatings
because I either stole potatoes or was found to be resting when I was supposed to
be working. It is ny opinion that it was necessary for the Capos to beat internees
otherwise the internees would never have obeyed their orders. I deserved the
beatings I received from STEUER because I stole potatoes and rested instead of
Tiorking. I have seen STEUER beat many people whose names I do not know and to
mj knowledge none of these people died as a result of beatings administered by
STEUER. I have heard from various people at Bunslau Camp, however, that some
of the people did die. I would describe STEUER as being aged about 35 y«rs.

DS’OSITION OP PETER IWANOW (Male) late of Aldarkino, near Kuibiachow, Ruaaia,
ewom brfor*	« ./X,aCU<a«A^ .
U^JLJ&ciIt, f\of. Vn<x-	.
1.	I am J2 years of age and served as a Signaller in the 497th Signals
Battalion of the Russian Army until I was taken prisoner by the Genaans near
LuMtaf in September 1941. I later escaped and worked as a Partisan until I
was recaptured in September 1942. I then passed through the following Labour
Camps in Germany:- Halle, Torgau and Falkenberg. I escaped again in June 1943
and was recaptured at Kattowitz, Silesia, and taken to Auschwitz Concentration
Canp in July 1943. I stayed there until November 1943 when I was transferred
to Buchenwald where I stayed for a month. I then moved to Dora Canp and I
finally came to Belsen on 8th April 1945.
2.	On 15th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SCAMANS, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whom I recognized as
a Capo whom I first met on the journey from Dora to Belsen. I have now been
informed that his name is VLADISLAV OSTROWOSKI.
3.	prom Dora I was marched with other prisoners to a small canp about
nine kilometres away where we stayed the night. The following day we began
an eight day train journey to Belsen. We arrived at the small camp I have
mentioned about 5.p.nu on the first day of our journey. Many of the prisoners
were standing on the road passing through the small camp when the Capo,0STRCrff05KI
approached. He was carrying a very thick wooden stick about a yard long and
three inches thick. Upon reaching the prisoners in the road he began to beat
them indiscriminately with the stick. Altogether he beat between 15 and 20
prisoners, knocking them to the ground by blows on the head and other parts of
the body. Some of the prisoners were rendered unconscious by the blows. I
saw all this happen and the beatings were coupletely unwarranted. OSTROVSKI ,
who is a strongly built man, proudly cleared a path for himself through the
group of prisoners by knocking them off the road with his stick. I cannot
say whether any of the victims were killed, but they were all injured by the
blows.
^	During the short period I was in Belsen Caap there was very little
.1-﻿f<J6d distributed. Only twice did we get any food and that was a small quantity
of soup. Together with other prisoners from Dora I was detailed to live in
19, of which OSTHDWOSKI was Capo in charge. It was his responsibility to
distribute this soup. The prisoners were naturally very hungry and, on both
occasions, rushed to get their soup. I saw OSTRQWOSKI, on both occasions, beat
many of the hungry prisoners with the iron handle of a broken soup ladle. The
iron handle had sharp edges and OSTHDWOSKI beat prisoners across the head and
other parts of the bocty with it, causing severe injuries and bleeding. A
number of victims were rendered unconscious by these blows, but I cannot say
whether any of them died.
5.	On the morning of 15th April 1945 when British troops arrived at
the Canq>,OSTROWOSKI came into the block at about 5.15.&.m. The block was
over-crowded and I saw him walk across the sleeping bodies of the prisoners
not caring where he trod. He was again carrying the iron handle and he beat
prisoners with it as he walked through the block, shouting to them to get out
on Apell. When prisoners did get up he beat them with the iron handle as they
went out on to Apell. It was fairly dark at that time and I could not see
what injuries were inflicted or if any of the prisoners were killed by the blows.
The and sick prisoners who were in the block had to be carried out on to
Apell that morning.
On the day before the camp was liberated I was told by another
Russian prisoner, who left Belsen some weeks ago, that the Capo, OSTROWOSKI,
had beaten a French prisoner to death in his block. I did not see the incident
nyself. I did not sleep every night in block IS, as it was too over-crowded,
and therefore I cannot say all that happened in block 19.

CUCOtUy	,^of. W<v%
1.	I am 22 years of age and was taken prisoner by the Germans, while
serving with the 6th Russian Army, near Kharkov on 27th May 1942. Whilst
being conveyed to the P.O.W. Camp, by train, to Germany I escaped but was
recaptured after three weeks and handed over to the Gestapo. I was taken
to Wurzburg in Germany where I again escaped but was recaptured and taken
to Schlossehberg Concentration Canqp. On 20th October 1942 I was transferred
to Malthausen Camp where I rmained for 18 months before being moved to
Wienerneustadt Camp where I stayed for two months. On leaving there I
stayed for five days at Buchenwald and then went to Dora Canp where I remained
until I came to Belsen on 9th April 1945*
2.	On 15th June 1345 I was shown by Serjeant SC AMAHS, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whan I recognized as
the Capo who was in charge of Block 19 at Ellrich Canp. I have now been
informed that his full name is VLADISLAV OSTRQWOSKI.
3.	After leaving Dora Canp for Belsen Canp I spent two days at Ellrich
Canp and it was then that I met the man I have referred to. The first day at
Dora I was one of 900 men of Block 19, who were ordered to sit in a squatting
f|A	CV- ■flAo*
/because one of the internees had excreted outside the block. This
punishment was given by OSTHDWOSKI, who hit any prisoner who moved or spoke
with a soup ladle handle. He confined most of these beatings to the very sick
prisoners. During the two days I was at Ellrich I saw 0STH0W0SKI beat many
sick prisoners over the head with this same instrument. The heads of the
beaten prisoners were cut open and blood streamed from their wounds. On
several occasions I have had to remove bodies of persons who died at Ellrich
Gasp because of the beatings received from OSTROWOSKI.

mostly at Apell times, for no reason at all. When prisoners lined up for food
OSTHDWOSKI went down the line of waiting man and beat and hit them. Again it
was n»stly the sick prisoners who took the punishment.	5/.»»﻿5#	One morning, just after we arrived at Belsen, OSTHOWOSKI called
e^j^yone out on Apell, One of the prisoners, I do not know his name but he
was a Frenchman, was so sick that he could not move,	I saw OSTBOWOSKI hit
the Frenchman on the head with a soup ladle handle.	I cannot say just what
injuries he received but his head was covered in blood. I later saw this
man's body dragged away by other prisoners and put on to a heap of dead bodies
outside tto hut.	-fv	^	'

Russia, sworn before C	»-oP^e-S,
S	^ VN**-p . ^K<W'v«C»>^o-tr\»	— .
1.	I am 21 years of agp and I was working in a factory at Nikolajow
when the Germans captured the town in January 1942. I was then arrested by
the Germans and put in prison at Nikolajow for about 12 months, after which I
was transferred to Buchenwald. After about a month there I was transferred to
Dora Camp where I remained until March 1945• I was then moved to Ellrich Camp
for two days after which I came to Belsen.
2.	On 15th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SCAMAM3, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whom I recognised as
the Capo of the block in which I lived at Dora camp. I have now been informed
that his name is VLADISLAV OSTRDWOSKI.
3.	Whilst at Dora Camp I saw OSTROWOSKI beat many prisoners every day.
The prisoners at Dora Camp, including nyself, were compelled to work on twelve
hour shifts, alternately on nights and days, underground. We had to dig a
deep tunnel there, for a factory, and the work was very hard. OSTROWOSKI
did not work in the tunnel but remained in the block all the time. When we
finished work we returned to the block for food. OSTROWOSKI frequently refused
to give many of us food and he did not give much to the others. He never
distributed the food fairly so that many of the prisoners starved.	When
prisoners went to him to ask for food he beat them. Sometimes he beat them
with his hands, sometimes with a thick stick, sometimes a big metal soup spoon
and he often kicked them whilst they were on the ground. OSTROWOSKI delighted
in punishing prisoners and would not allow us to sleep during non-forking hours.
When we went to the block to rest he called Aprils at all hours, sometimes at
3 ani 4 o’clock in the morning after we had been working all day, and sometimes
during the daytime when we had been on night shift. OSTROWOSKI worked on
behalf of the S.S. and took these Aprils cm his own receiving special
considerations for doing so. He received drink and cigarettes from the S.S.
«U»	, tv-T
for the way in which he treated the prisoners; Many of the prisoners at Dora
xv	ffsa. fik.	.
died through over^-work, undernourishment, lack of rest and beatings.
-1-﻿06TB0WOSKI was responsible for this ill-treatment. I did not see him actually
S. \ any prisoner outright by beating tiiem at Dora.
4.	On transfer to ELLrich concentration camp I was, for those two days,
in block 19 of which OSTRCWOSKI was again the Capo. During these two days none
of us received any food and OSTBOWOSKI beat mary prisoners as before.
5.	OSTROWOSKI moved to Belsen with us and we were placed in block 19
with OSTROWOSKI again the Capo. He continued to beat and ill-treat prisoners
in the same way as before. About 4.a.m. one morning, about three days after
we arrived in Belsen, OSTROWOSKI ordered all of us out of the block on to Apell.
One prisoner, a Frenchman, was sick and unable to get up. I saw OSTROWOSKI go
to the Frenchman and give him a very heavy blow on the head with a piece of iron
which he was carrying. The blow smashed the Frenchman's head and smotho'ed his
i SOW* ♦***'“o*
head and face in blood. He did not move again. He was kill-ed. Later in the
day the Frenchman* s body, together with others who had died in the block during
the night, was carried out and put on a heap of dead bodies in the camp. I
assisted in this job. I am quite certain that the Frenchman was killed by the
brutal attack made on him by OSTROWOSKI.
S'	i have been beaten nyself by OSTROWOSKI on a number of occasions
both at Dora and Belsen. One day in Belsen when I was sick with Typhus, I asked
OSTROWOSKI for food. Instead of giving me any OSTROWOSKI beat me across the

DEPOSITION OP SMC HA ZAMOSKI (Male) late of 2^ Tagovft, Kosmsiche, near Radm,
Poland, sworn befor4-Maa«^-&AV^^BCiFPREr^CHAMPION; Royal Artillery, Legal
Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am 20 years of age and because I am a Jew I was arrested on
15th November 192*2 anl taken to Caa^) Skarzisko where I remained until I was
transferred to Solejo Cani> in June 1943. In August 1944 I was transferred to
Czenslochan Camp, in the winter of 194V5 to Dora Camp and finally to Belsen
in April 1945.
2.	I identify No. 3 on photograph No. 5 a-s an S.S. man at Doze, and
Belsen Cajq>s. At Dora this man was in charge of the bath-house and at Belsen
he was in charge of one of the cook-houses. I have now been told that his name
is ANCHOR PICHEN.
3#	I arzrived at Dora Camp during the winter of 194V5 on a very cold
and snowy day. As soon as the transport arrived we were all taken to the bath-
house of which PICHEN was in charge. He was carrying a rubber truncheon and
as we undressed he started beating prisoners without reason. After we had
undressed we entered the bathroom and had to stand under icy-cold showers.
If anyone left the shower PICHEN ordered than back. He afterwards turned on
very hot water and again when anyone left he was ordered back by PICHM who
struck the prisoner concerned on the head and body with the truncheon. We
were scalded all over the body and in great pain. This process of hot and
cold water went on for about an hour and during this time we were ordered by
PICHEN to mng. After this we were not allowed to dress but had to wait until
all the men in our transport had been through the same procedure. PICHEN got
tired of continually beating and gave his truncheon to a Polish prisoner who
worked in the bath-house aixl ordered him to carry on with the beating. After
all the transport had had the so called shower PICHEN ordered us all to do
exercises for two or three hours without any rest. During this time he beat
any prisoner who showed any signs of slackening and we got so exhausted that
we implored him to beat us to death as we could stand no more. When about
nine hours had elapsed, from*the time we first entered the bath-house, we
„„	to dr... md go to our *100*..	*» » ■'“■ult of th... tortur..
I know that they were dead because
five or six men died during the night.
-1-﻿we tried to wake them in the morning and were unable to do bo. On the
1 -ructions of the Block Altester I aaslated in carrying the corpses outside
our block, which was Ho. 35. Later I saw the crematorium lorry pick up the
bodies and take^i them away.
4,	I identify No. 4 on photograph No. 1 aa an 3.S. man who was at
Dora and Bela on Camps. I have now been told that his name is OTTO GALES SON
(KBLESSA). This man was in charge of the transport in which I travelled from
Dora Camp to Belsen and which arrived about ?th April 1945. During the
journey which took six days officially we did not get anything to eat or drink.
A little food was given to Christians and some of the better S.S. did give the
Jews a little. In ny overcrowded railway waggon about 50 men died during the
journey. I asked GALES SON if he would have the dead taken out but he refused
and said that all of us would be dead by the time we got to Belsen. On
arrival at Belsen we were detailed to our various blocks.	GALES SON stood at
the door of ny block and beat prisoners,who were too weak to move quickly,
with an iron bar. Many men fell down and I know that some of than were so
seriously injured that they had to be taken to Hospital the next morning.
Amongst then was my friend LEIBL MAIDAN from Wurka, near Warsaw. When I
went to see him on the second day after our arrival the Warden in the Hospital
told me that he was dead. His death was undoubtedly due to the blows he
received from GALES SON.

DEFOSITICN OP ARUTN HORW (Male), Doctor of Medicine, late of Budapest,

Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimea Investigation Team.
1. I was an internee acting as a Doctor at Hanover Camp. I remember the
case of a Dutch boy, aged about 20 years, who was admitted to Hospital with
severe injuries as a result, so I was told, of a beating. This was in
March 1945.
2. I know IGNATZ SCHLOMOIVTCZ who was a Capo. I have seen him in the
Hospital as a patient. He was discharged from the Hospital before the
said Dutch boy was admitted. I have never seen SCHLOMOIVTCZ in the
Hospital save and except as above mentioned and I never saw him near or
speaking to the Dutch boy in the Hospital. I know nothing about the Dutch
boy's bread ration having been taken away from him.
3. I know a man called HOROWITZ. He was a Hungarian Jew employed In
the internees' Hospital at Hanover as a clerk. The last I saw of him was
at Belsen after the English arrived. I have been told that he has left
the camp with other Hungarians and may be in Hanover.

July 1^42 and taken to Rartdom Labour Camp. I was transferred to PionkL

three days at Berkenau I was transferred to Hinderiburg Labour Camp and
on 20th January 1945 X came to .Bel,sen..........
2. On 19 th June 1945 I was shown by No. 34573509 Serjeant EDWARD DINS DALE
86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a woman whom
I recognised as the block-leader of my block. No. 22, during the three days
I was at Berkenau. I knew her by the name of ’ Sal a’ and I have now been
told that her full name is SALA RAJCZEC.
3.	During the three days I have mentioned I saw RAJCZEC beat many women
prisoners without any apparent reason. Sometimes she would use her fists
and sometimes a thick wooden stick which she always carried. Often the
women would fall to the ground but I cannot say how badly injured they were
nor, apart from the undermentioned instances, do I know their names.
4.	On one occasion I saw her hit my friend RITA PINKELSTEIN on the head
with a boot. This was because RITA did not leave the block quickly enough
at Apell.
5.	On another occasion I saw RAJCZEC beating my friend’s sister, SURA
PINKELSTEIN, with the thick stick she was carrying. I was afterwards
told by SURA that she had been beaten because she was wearing a scarf
round her head contrary to regulations. SURA was bleeding from the mouth
and one of her teeth had been knocked out as a result of this brutal assault.
6.	On another day, at Berkenau, I saw RAJCZBC beating ny sister, BEINA
GOLDBERG, who was aged twelve years, with her fists. My sister fell to the
ground with blood flowing from her mouth and nose and she had to be carried
away by other prisoners. An 3.S. woman was quite near whan the beating took
place and I got the impression that RAJCZEC had beaten ny sister to try to
impress the S.S. woman with the fact that she was doing her job properly.

2,	On 18th June 1945 I was shown by No, 14604094 Serjeant CYRIL ALBERT
SCAMAHS, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a
woman whom I recognized as an Obercapo who I first knew at Berkenau, I
• Ai: a*••r••	X.**6
knew her by the name of 'Sofia' and have now been told that her full name
is SOFIA SEYFARTH.
3.	Som* time about the end of November 1944 I went with five or si*
other women prisoners, in a working party, to a village near Berkenau to
collect some coils of wire, SEYFARTH was in charge of the party. On
the way	to the cany we became very exhausted as the wire was so heavy,
I put my coil of wire on the ground to have a rest and when I did so
SEYFARTH came up and beat me on the left arm and head with a thick wooden
stick. I fell to the ground and SEYFARTH then kicked me on the head.
I sufferTwith severe pains in the head and my left arm was cut and bleeding.
In spite of this I was forced to continue carrying the wire back to the
camp. Other members of this working party who also stopped to rest were
similarly treated by SEYFARTH.
4.	During December 1944 one of the women prisoners, who was a member of
ny working party, was so weak and sick that she could not work. Her name
was HOSZI POLLACK ani she came from Beregsaz, Czecho-Slovakia. SEYFARTH
saw that she was not working and came up and beat her on the head with a
spade. She fell to the ground and SEYFARTH then kicked her on the head
and back. She then dragged POLLACK along the ground by the hair pulling
out some of her hair in the process. Soon afterwards two S.S. men took
aj*A ICU>-
POLLACK away to Hospital. I went to the Hospital some four or five days
later to see ay friend but the Nurse told me she had died. I have no
doubt that her death was due to the brutal treatment she received from
SEYFARTH.

3.	I have seen SEYFARTH on many occasions during the winter months of
1944 take clothing away from other prisoners. These clothes were taken to
a nearby village by SEYFARTH and exchanged for food and drink which she
kept for herself.
4.	In December 1944 one of the women prisoners, I do not know her name,
went to the lavatory during working hours. SEIFARTH saw her go and
followed her to the lavatory where she beat her over the head with a wooden
stick. I saw this happen and I also saw the woman pushed by SEYFARTH into
the latrine. When she got out she was covered with excreta from the latrine
as well as having blood on her head. The beaten prisoner went down to the
river to wash the dirt and blood off and was again followed by SEIFARTH who
pushed her in the river. SEIFARTH afterwards pilled her out of the river
but I do not know what happened to her after that.

3.	Whilst at Berkenau I have on many occasions seen SEYFARTH beat women
prisoners, with a thick wooden stick, for no reason at all. She also made
a habit of confiscating clothing from prisoners which she later exchanged
for food and drink. During -fNovember 1944, in the very cold weather, I
had no overcoat and I was wearing three woollen pullovers to keep myself
warm. SEYFARTH saw that I was doing this and took two of than away and
as a result I suffered very badly from the cold.
4.	During November/D ecember 1944 I saw another woman prisoner come from
the latrine covered in excreta and blood. She was followed by SEYFAETH
down to the river where she tried to wash herself. SEYFARTH pushed her
in the river whilst I was watching, I cannot say what happened after that
but the prisoner was pulled out of the river.

woman whom I recognized as an Obercapo who I first knew at Berkenau. I
knew her by the name of ' Sofia’ and I have now been told that her full
name is SOFIA SEYFAHTH.
3.	SOFIA SEYFARTO was feared throughout the cauf) at Berkenau for the
beatings which she gave and for the "fact that she frequently took clothing
from prisoners which she later exchanged for food and drink. During the
winter of 1944 I myself had a woollen dress taken from me by SEYFARTO. It
was very cold at the time and ny health suffered very badly as a result.
4.	During the same winter I went with a working party consisting of
four other prisoners to a village about 8 kilometres from the camp.
SEYFARTO was in charge of the party. We had to collect some very heavy
coils of wire and carry them back to the camp. SEYFARTO beat any of the
prisoners, we were all women, who dropped the coils of wire. Owing to
the heaviness of the wire it was necessary to have a rest from time to
time. At one stage of the journey I placed ray coil of wire on the ground
to have a rest. SEYFARTO then came tq? to me and beat me on the head with
a wooden stick cutting ny head open and causing blood to run down ny face.
Although I was weak from this beating I was forced by SEYFARTO to carry the
wire back to the camp.
5.	In December 1944 one of the prisoners, whose name I do not know, wait
to the lavatory during working hours. I did not see this particular
occurrence but I was told by other prisoners that she had been followed by
SEYFARTO who beat her on the head with a stick and pushed her into the
latrine. I did see the women come from the latrine covered with excreta
and blood.

Bohemia, sworn before Major SAVTLE GBOFFREI CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal
Statt, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
I an 33 years of age and I was arrested on 30th June 1939
1.
because I was a' supporter of President Befleb.' I was taken to a prison in
Prague and in December 1939 transferred to Dachau where I remained until
June 1941 when I was transferred to Buchenwald. In October 1941 I was
transferred to Auschwitz, in October 1942 to Neungansne, in January 194-3
to Braunschweig and finally to Belsen on 11th April 194-5.
2.	I identify No. 2 on photograph No. 7 as an S.S. man at Belsen.
I have now been told that his name is OSCAR SMEDIDZT (SCHMITZ). On 13th
or 14th April 1945 1 was standing near fey block in the men1 s camp in Belsen.
A group of prisoners was standing near* the barbed wire which separated the
block from the main street. Across this street was No. 1 Kitchen and
nearby was a pile of turnips. It was no doubt the intention of the
prisoners to get through the barbed wire and cross the street to steal a
few turnips. While they were standing there SMEDIDZT appeared on his
bicycle and apparently realized the intention qf the men. He pulled
out his pistol and fired several times into the group of prisoners. It
was the usual custom for SMEDIDZT to fire his pistol whenever he saw a
group of men standing near this wire. When SMEDIDZT fired his pistol
three men fell to the ground and the rest ran away. SMEDIDZT carried
on cycling and I went into my block. I later heard from other prisoners
that the three men I saw fall to the ground were dead. I was told that
they had been taken by other prisoners to the Hospital Block and put on
the existing pile of corpses.

Breslau idlere I remained until 28 th March 1944-. I was then transferred to
Bunslau Camp and in February 1945 sent to Dora Camp where I remained for
three days prior to ny removal to Elrich Cany. I stayed there for ten days
and came to Belsen on 9th April 1945*
2.	On 20th June 1945 I was shown by No. 14604028 Serjeant REGINALD

Capo and on this job I worked under him for three months - February, March
and April 1944. On 9th May 1944 the camp was changed from a Labour Can?) to
a Concentration Camp. During the three months I worked under STEGER I
received many beatings from him, usually for slacking at work. For these
beatings he used a wooden stick about 2ft. long and about one inch in diameter.
On one occasion STEUER beat me on the head and as a result one of my eyes
became very badly swollen. This swelling lasted for some ten days. During
the time that STEUER was Chief Capo he always carried a stick with which he used
to beat people. I have seen him beat people every day while I was at ftmslau
and in ny opinion these beatings were far too severe for the offence committed.
These beatings were usually given as punishment for resting or slacking at work.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
BEATINGS AT BUNSLAH CAMP.
DEPOSITION OP FISCHER GOFFECD (Mule) late of 33 Oder Straaae, Sosnowitt,
Poland, •earn before Major SAVILE GBOFFEET CHAMPION, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 21 years of age and because I am a Jew I was arrested by the
Gestapo on 4th January 1942 said taken to Sopiewitz Labour Gang?, Upper
Silesia. I remained there until June 1942 when I was transferred to
Bunslau Concentration Camp. In Marcia 1949 I was sent to Dora Camp
and on 3rd April 1949 I came to Belsen.
2.	One morning in November 1943, whilst at Bunslau Camp, I was on
Ap»n with ny working group. In the working group next to mine on
parade I h»d a friend whose name was PQZMANTIR who came from Bedzburg,
Poland ani who lived in the same block as myself - Block No. 9. Before
we went on Apell I knew that he was very weak and that his feet were
so badly swollen tfaathe had great difficulty in putting on his wooden
shoes. He was, in fact, in such a condition that he was carried to
the parade ground by Stubenalteste JAKUBOWICZ who was in charge of the
vinnir. The head Capo at Bunslau camp was a man named WALTE STEUER.
Just before the working groups were marched away to their respective
jobs I heard ny frieni ask STEUER if he could be excused work that day
owing to the condition of his feet. (His working party 12 kilometres
to march to get to their working site.) STEUER refused this request and
I saw ny frieni collapse. I saw STEDER pick him up but ny friend again
fell to the grouni. STEUER then conmenced to beat ny frieni with a
wooden stick about three long and about two inches in diameter. While
ny frieni was lying on the grouni STEUER beat him about the head and body
and kicked Mm. I later saw ny friend's body removed from the parade
ground to the wash-house near No. 1 kitchen. Four or five days later
ny friend's body was still there and it was covered with crawling while
won*. I saw a medical orderly pour some white liquid over the body
and I afterwards saw the body put in a coffin, placed on a lorry and
driven away.
3. Two days after the above occurrance another friend of mine named
RIMER who came from Sucha, Poland, and who suffered from Epileptic fits﻿wma cm Apcll. He had one of hie fits and STSJER went to hi*. I heard
3TEUBR say 'You are not able to work eo I will kill yew'. He then started
to beat KJTEWER with a wooden stick about three feet long and about two
inches in diameter. He beat him about the head and body until ay friend
fell to the ground. I did not see hi* more afterwards. After the
i heard a Doctor MENDEL say to STEUER 'He is dead. He can be taken
to the wash-house.' I saw my friend's body renewed fro* the parade ground
and taken to the wash-house. Two days later I saw that his body was still
in the wash-house. I saw white worms crawling over it and a medidal
orderly was dusting it with a white powder. His body was later put in
a wooden box and taken away. This was about eigit days after he had died.
I would describe Doctor MENDEL as aged about 45-50 years, height 5ft.lOins.,
VIH head except for a fringe of fair hair, grey cat-like eyes, well built,
corpulent, left shoulder deformed which makes his right shoulder higier
th»n the left, wears spectacles when writing.
4. During the time I was at BONSLAU Camp I have seen STEXTEB beat to
death with a stick at least 50 people. These beatings always took place
at Apell for petty offences such as being too weak to work, or having
swollen feet and being unable to walk. While at Bunslau I was enployed
as a bricklayer. The group consisted of about 80 men and we worked under
a Gernwn foreman. From the time of ny arrival at this cany I was beaten
with a stick every two or three days by STEUER. I have been beaten on
the body and head and was never allowed medical treatment. I have bled
and still have a scar behind ny left ear as a result of one of the beatings
STEUER gave me. I was usually beaten by STEUER for resting while
at work or for taking potatoes from the store. I have seen STEUER beat
ny friend HENRYK PRICER on many occasions and I have also seen many other
internees beaten by STEUER, none of whom were allowed medical treatment
afterwards.
5.	On 11th May 1944 the easy changed from a labour easy to a concentratioj
easy, and the new Cany Comaandant, Untersoharfuhrer SCHAMMHL gave order#
that on no account were the internees to be beaten. SCHAIM5L brought with
hi* a Head Capo and STEUER was made his assistant. When I left BUNSLAU
Cany STBUEH was still there.
6.	On the ■prning of 10th June 1945 I to14 * friend of mine
named MIBCHTSKI, idvo lives at Celle, that STHJER was at Belsen Canp in

1.	I am 22 years of age and because I am a Jew I was arrested by the
Germans in November 1940 and taken to Bahrau Labour Gang) where I remained
when
until June 1942, / In&Bnrinacx&ivfc I was transferred to Grosamaslowitz
Camp. In December 1942 I was sent to Neukirch camp and in February 1943
was transferred to Blechharamer Camp where I remained until May 1943• I
was then sent to Wisau Gang) and in May 1944 was taken to Bunslau Gang).
In March 1945 I went to Dora Can® and at the end of that month was
transferred to Belsen.
2.	While I was at Bunslau Gang) the Chief Capo there was a Pole named
WALTE STEtJER. He was in charge of labour and slept in a block with all
the other Capos of the camp. I was engdoyed transporting wood from a
Saw Mjn outside the caug> to the cang> itself. Ify working party was
under the control of a civilian German foreman named HOPRICHTER. I did
not get on very well: with this man so I asked STEOER if I could be
transferred to another working party. This was in April 1944. When I
STEHEE if I could be transferred he immediately ccomenced to beat
me with a wooden stick about three feet long and about two inches in
diameter. He beat me on the head and body, and as a result of this
beating I became unconscious. I regained consciousness the next morning
and found that ay head had been split open and that I had lost a lot of
blood. Although I did not feel well I was forced to continue working.
While working I felt ill and stopped work, but was seen by STEXJER. He
beat me with his hands.
3.	Every day I was beaten by STEDER and sometimes he beat me twice
daily with a stick. On 11th May 1944 the caag> was changed from a labour
o«g> to a concentration camp. The new Camp Ccnmendant was Dnterscharfuhrer
SCHRAMMEL S.S. He would allow none of the Capos to beat the internees.
SCHRAMMEL brought with him a new Chief Capo and STEDER was kept on as his
assistant. When I left Bunalaa STEDER was still there and I did not see
him again until 10th June 1945 when, as a result of information given to
-1-﻿ove by a friend, whose name ie MIHOWSKI and who livea at Celle, I went
with another friend named FISCHER GOFFHID to Block W.B.6, Belaen Canf).
I had been told that STEUER would be there and I wanted to hare ngr
revenge on	He was not there when we arrived but we met him
returning from the kitchen. I hit him quite a lot and then reported
the facts to the Polish Li as on Officer who returned with via and took
STEDER to the Military Police Headquarters. I recognised this man
as the man who had beaten me at Bunslau Caiap,
4« During my stay at Bunslau Camp I should say that the mini mum
number of people daily beaten by STEUER for petty offences was about
thirty. All these people had to continue working without medical
assistance.

IN THE MATTER CP WAR CRIMES

A CAPO NAMED MEDISLAW BURGRAF.
DSPOSITICN OF ADAM MARCINKOWSKI (Male) late of 8 Zocka, Warsaw, Poland,------
before	^	t	t
(	. hl<x~	^vrxi^ .
1.	I am 21 years of age and I was arrested in the street in Warsaw
without any reason on 8th April 192*1 and taken to Siegburg Textile Factory.
I am a Roman Catholic. I was transferred to a factory in Koin in April
192*2, to Sachsenhausen in April 192f3, to a Heinkel factory near Berlin in
April 192*4, to Cany Dritte, near Brunswick in June 192*4 and finally to
Belsen in April 1945.
2.	On 20th June 1945 I was shown by No. 14575509 Serjeant ETWARD
DINSDALE, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man
whom I recognized as a Capo in Dritte Cany, and as Stubenaltester of Block
19 at Belsen Cany. I knew him by the name of Medislaw and I have now been
11 _ ..._	.
told that his full name is MEDISLAW BURGRAF.
3.	I remember the following incident which occurred at Belsen Cany.
On 12th April 1945, at about	> a friend of mine, GEORG GRABONSKI, who
lived at Warsaw, and who, like myself, then lived in Block 21, went to Block
19 which was about 8 metres away. BURGRAF stood at the door of Block 19.
I was at a window of Block 21 and heard ny friend ask BURGRAF for permission
to enter Block 19 to see a sick friend. BURGRAF refused, and when ny friend
again asked him BURGRAF, who was standing at the top of the steps leading
into the block, struck ny friend GRABONSKI, who was then standing at the
foot of these steps, a two handed blow with a square table leg which he
always carried. The blow fell at the back of ny friend* s head and he
immediately collapsed. When I saw this I imnediately went down and dragged
ny friend into Block 21. By the time I arrived downstairs BURGRAF had
re-entered his block. GRABONSKI had an open wound at the back of his head.
I attended to him for about three hours but at the end of that time he died.
I carried his body and put it with the pile of corpses already outside the
block. Ol^	cJU* ^	*V/- J c—fr
\ <C|?ro^n^ Block, at Belsen, I sometimes watched the distribution
of soup at meal-times outside Block 19. This distribution was d<«e by a
-1-﻿* prisoner, who was supervised by HJKGRAP, During the short period I was at
BHIXX Bel sen very little food was given to prisoners and as the men ware very
^^gry, when food was distributed, they rushed to be served first* BURGRAF
would then beat them indiscriminately with the table leg, I have seen very
weak men fall down and later on be dragged by their comrades to the piles of
corpses. I can say that I have personally seen BORGRAF beat about 50 persons
to death in this way over a period of four to five days.

Hanover,
I remember about 5th, April 1945 two men carried a Dutch boy to the
2.
hospital about 5 o'clock in the morning and asked if he could be taken in.
His hands were broken, his head bleeding and he was bruised around the kidneys,
I asked the two men what had happened to him and they told me he had broken
a cupboard ancji stolen some bread for which SCHLOMOIVICZ had beaten him that night
and he had again been beaten in the morning by JACOBI, I made further enquiries
and many prisoners told me the same story,
3,	As far as I know SCHLOMOIVICZ never came to the Hospital after the
Dutch boy had been brought in but it is possible that SCHLCWOIVTCZ could have
visited him without my knowing of it,
4,	We left Hanover for Belsen on 8th, April 1945. The Dutch boy
was left behind in Hospital, and I have not heard of him again. There are
two men at present in my camp at Hanover, whose names I do not know, who were
in Hospital with the Dutch boy all the time,
5,	I was with SCHLOMOIVICZ for about 9 months at different camps.
In that time I often saw him beating prisoners with a stick. Many got broken

in BELSEN Camp.
A.	At about this time a runner came to report shooting
by SS Guards at the Western end of the Mens' Camp. I proceeded immediately
to the spot in company v/ith Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, taking JOSEF KRAMER
with us.
5.	At the Western end of the Mens* Camp, some thirty
yards due East of the Gate leading thence to the Crematorium, I found a
stack of straw-covered potato plants. A number of male internees Oa die
Camp were foraging in the stack for food. Surrounding than were three
or four individual manbers of the SS Guards of the Camp armed with automatic
weanons of Sten Gun type. As I approached the spot I saw and heard them
firing single shots at the aforesaid internees and they made no attempt
to cease firing when I came up to them, JOSEF KRAMER made no attempt
to prevent them or to interfere.
g.	Such firing was indiscriminate and gave the impression
of being a customary pastime. Several dead and tying internees were lying
on and around the potato stack. I saw one or two fall as a result Oi the
firing as I aooroached. I em unable to identify the SS Guards responsible
for the firing*but have been shown photographs of the SS Guards now in our
custoty and No 3 on Photograph 24, whose name I am informed is STEPHAN
KONRAD, appears to me to resemble strongly one of the Guards involved.
Y/e gave immediate orders to KRAMER that all shooting at
internees was to cease inmediately, and that any further case reported to
► would result in one SS Guard being shot for every internee killed. I
also directed that the dead and wounded be removed for burial and
medical attention respectively. At least one of the dead was carried
away on my orders by JOSEF KRAMER, who showed the utmost reluctance to
comply with the order. ,
8.	Despite my orders single shots were to be heard around
the perimeter of the Camp, some of which may have come from the Guard
towers, during the next 16 to 18 hours.
I formed the strongest impression that such shooting
at internees was a popular sport among the Guards for no adequate reason
since I am convinced that no attempts to escape were made after the British
occupation ccrnnenced. A further repetition of orders to shoot one for one
was necessary before this could be finally stopped.﻿10.
On the 16th April 1945 it was reported to me
of the Hungarian Soldiers employed as guards by the SS had
that some of the Hungarian Soldiers employed as guaros uy tue oo
■ioken into and looted the food store. It v/as further reported that
^lod sent by charitable organisations, principally Jewish, for the
use of internees, was customarily regarded as the perquisite of the
Guards. I issued stringent orders to the Hungarians in this regard
and no further such looting was reported.
In regard to the generally deplorable condition
of the Camp and my report above referred to, it is my considered
opinion that such conditions were the result of gross negligence and
criminal lack of care on the part of the Camp Staff over a period
certainly not less than twelve weeks. In my opinion it is
inconceivable that the state of affairs existing on 15th April 1945
could have been attained in any less time.

1. INTR&DUCTION.
I
As the result of a visit to HQ BCorps by two German Emissaries
of the Wehrraacht under a white flag, information was received of the
location of this Concentration Camp at BEB3EN# and the existence there of
some 60,000 prisoners, said to be mainly political; 1,300 of them were
said to be suffering from Typhus fever; 900 to have contracted Typhoid and
tnat there was a large number of cases of other conditions, infectious and
otherwise.
As a result of this information two officers of the staff of 8
Corps HQ were conducted to HQ 1st German Para. Army where negotiations
took place to obviate any fighting over this area or the possible liberat-
ion of such a large number of infected personnel.
A copy of the agreement reached is included as Appendix 'A*.
2. PjEJOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.
Eft CM 13 AHt to 19 AH^ 45.
During this period I carried out the following major
activities.
15th April. A Military detachment consisting of one Bty of 63 A/Tk
Regt with Lt.Col. R. TAYLOR DSO as Allied Military Comaander
had been detailed to proceed to BELSE3I Camp on its capture to
take it over and at about 1800 hours in company with Lt.Col.
Taylor I intex-viewed the SS Commandant of this Camp, JOSEPH
KRAIS?. I was given to understand later that this man was
notorious as the result of his activities at other SS Camps.
Following this int ex-view and shortly before the hours of dark-
ness a general survey of the camp was made, during which
certain activities of the SS were brought to light.
2200 hrs. Interview ed Senior SS Medical Officer(KLEIN) and Senior
German Med Administrative Officer(STABLER) of the area. Gave
them a questionnaire which was to be completed by 1000 hrs

and that tlie reiaainder would be required for the use of the
prisoners of Gamp 1. He agreed that the scale for his men was fair*
and that the conditions in Camp 1 were shameful.
GENERAL SURVEY OP BKLSBN CONCENTRATICK CAUP.
This concentration camp consists of two areas, one (Gamp 1) a hutted
camp made up of 5 Main Compounds, divided by wire, and an enclosure containing
administrative huts, all enclosed in a wired^in perimeter. Jn addition to this
a certain portion of the neighbouring barracks area had quite recently been
taken over as Camp 2 for the reception of 16,000 toale persons who had arrived
from other camps. Owing to the better aoconmodation and facilities, and their
recent arrival,.these prisoners were in much better condition than those in
Gamp 1.
Camp 1. r For plan of Camp”!, see Appendix 'B'.
Living Accommodation. This Gamp consists of 5 Compounds, 3 for men and 2
for women.
The total number of prisoners was given to me on lb Apr 45 as
Women	-	28,185.
Men	-	12,000 (Approx).
The sizes of these Compounds varies considerably; in the case of the men,
containing from approx 1,500 to 8,000 and the two women's enclosures (No.l)
23,000 and (No.2) approx. 5»000. In the former was one enclosure said to hold
ap^ox 500 children. In both men's and women's compounds conditions in the huts
varied‘considerably, some being bunked with 2-3 tiered bunks,whilst in others
the prisoners just lay crowded together on the.floor. Except in men's compound
No.3» there were certain huts set aside for use as hospital huts,but, except
in one of the men's compounds and in the large women's enclosure, these were
quite inadequate.- They were nbt even all bunked as the following figures will
show.
Women's Compounds.- Number of prisoners acutely ill suffering from
definite diseases exclusive of malnutrition was approx 2,000 and for
these there were only 474- bunks. In consequence each was occupied by
2 or 3 women, the remainder, including practically all typhus patients,
just lying on the bare boards. In Compound No.2 there was.one hut only
set aside as a hospital hut, and this was without any beds. In this
compound typhus patients were not segregated.
Men's Compound. .Hospital conditions in these compounds were not as good
as those in the Women's compounds,^although there were rather more bunks.
1959 for 2242 acutely ill. In compound No. 3 no huts at all had beer;
set aside.
Up to the time of their liberation it is understood 'that all
personnel had been strictly confined to their particular compound and
there was no mixing at all.
Cookhouses. There were 5 cookhouses within the precincts of Camp No.l.
Two for men, two for women and one mixed cookhouse. Their size varied,
but in the majority of cases 2 to 3 cookings had to be done for each meal.
The number of peals varied from 2 to 3 per diem and
consisted only of a soup of vegetables, mainly carrots, dried cabbage and
potatoes, thickened with meal. Very occasionally small amounts of meat
were added.
Water.	There were two or three small concrete ponds within the
camp from which prisoners could draw water, but as practically all
supplies were dependent upon electrical pumping there had been no water
at all for several days owing to the cables being cut.
Crematorium. At the bottom end of the camp was a crematorium consisting
of one oven which apparently had not been used for some time as the
/number.﻿Page
number of deaths had been increasing at too rapid a rate. In the
neighbourhood of this building Judging by the earth recently +■ - Tied
over had obviously been several graves of the mass pit vari and
this was confirmed by the Commandant. On the South side of the '
Camp was a large pit approx 25 yds x 8 yds x 4 yds in which were a
considerable number of blackened corpses.
Prison Cells. One building was set aside, consisting of bare
prison cells.
Administrative Area outside the Main frison Compounds. This
consisted of a main Office building and living huts around for
Guards and administrative personnel. In addition was a small build-
ing with a few ablution benches and a larger containing 4 big
disinfestation chambers, each capable of doing 60 sets of clothing
in l-g hours. In this latter building were 15 shower baths.
Latrines. These were practically non-existent and where, therf were
any consisted of a bare pole over a pit, without any screening what-'
soever.
Camp No. 2; This had only very' recently been formed (about one week) by taking
over a portion of the Barrack area. Aoccomodation here was naturally very much
better but all the buildings were grossly overcrowded and had of course got
already in a filthy condition. However, the majority of the inmates were in
moderately good condition, and there was no record of any oases of Typhus. The
prisoners were divided into barrack blocks by nationalities which made super-
vision considerably easier. One block had been set aside as a Hospital.
Barrack Area. Adjoining these 2 Camps and a continuation of Camp
No.2 was a most magnificent barrack area with every possible facility - good
canteens, cookhouses, excellent garages and stabling, a cinema, good married
quarters and a beautiful Officers’ Mess.
In this barrack block area were 3 hospital blocks
housing at the time they were seen 604 German Military patients, whilst in
beautiful surroundings just beyond the officers’ mess was an excellently appoint-
ed Military Hospital of 500 beds.
4. INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT.
15 Apr l+rj.
JOSEPH JltAMcK (Commandant) was interviewed by Lt.Col. Taylor,D30,
(Allied Military Commander) and myself, and whilst this was being carried
out there was be sound of intermittent small an:a fire but no indication
that this was 'within the camp area. However, a runner arrived to say that
there was rioting at the Central Cookhouse. On arrival there every tiling
seemed quiet, but one 3S man stated tiiat there had been stealing of soup.
There was no evidence of this. Rifle fire continued to be heard, this time
near at hand, and on proceeding through the camp, SS Guards were found to
"be shooting prisonei’s who in their hungry condition were endeavouring to
remove potatoes from a pile near the cookhouse.
Comm?ndant KRAMER made no attempt to stop his men ;nd it was only
on a threat to shoot the SS personnel immediately, on e basis of one fox’ one,
should ?ny further killing take place that the situation became quiet.
Neitlier Commandant KRAMHR nor any of his personnel made any attempt to
succour the wounded and dying, nox' to remove the dead. An order was given
to tins effect and the Commandant himself made to assist.
There was naturally considerable excitement amongst the prisoners
who wei’e thronging the Central x'oad outside their Compounds. Their welcome
was exuberant, but at that time absolutely orderly, ;uid although it was
extremely difficult to induce them to return within their compounds, this
was eventually done.
A detachment was left witlun the csxnp to maintain order and tanks
positioned near the main food store. Instructions were also given to all
enemy guards tiiat unless there was any xass attempt to escape outside the
perimeter of the camp all firing should be high.
/During.﻿Page 5.
57
During the night there was intermittent disturbance and both
\	single shots and automatic weapons had to be used by British troops
firing high to discourage looters. There were no casualties of any
kind during the night and everything was orderly at first light.
In addition to the Commandant I saw the Senior German SS Medical
Officer KLEIN who confessed oonqplete ignorance of the position,stating
that he had only been there a few days. I consider this an evasion as
although he may only have been in charge for a few days, I was informed
by many prisoners that he had been at the Camp for several months. He
was the only SS kedioal Officer in Cany 1.
To him and also the Senior Administrative Kedioal Officer (STADLER)
for the area, I gave a questionnaire which was to be completed by the
following morning (16th). This questionnaire covered the following
points;-
1. A nominal roll of the Kedioal Staff, Male and Female, with
any special appointments held.
»2. Number of Hospitals.
3.	Bed state in each Hospital.
4.	Diseases by types and numbers in each.
3. Medical stores available, to include vaccines.
6.	Food position, including special food for the seriously ill.
7.	Disinfesters available, number and capacity.
8.	Bathing facilities.
9.	Laundry facilities.
10.	Disinfectants available.
11.	Protective clothing,if used, and the amounts available.
12.	Clothing for prisoners available.
13.	Laboratory facilities.
During the attempt to peacefully persuade the inmates to return to
their compounds it was abundantly obvious that conditions were appalling.
Numerous dead bodies were seen which could not have resulted from the
recent shooting, one inmate reported that the huts too contained large
numbers of corpses sharing the acconmodation with the living.
Many of the inmates talked to were obviously well bred and
intelligent. Their condition was pitiable in the extreme and although
many stories of their hardships were told it in no way prepared one for
the indescribable horrors seen on the following day.
16 Apr 43- At 0830 hours a rapid tour of the whole area of both Camp 1 and
Camp 2 was arranged and during this a prepared statement was broadcast
in four languages td all prisoners, announcing that German control of
the Camp was at an end and had been taken over by the British forces.
The inmates were promised help of all kinds and exhorted to remain
quiet so that the efforts of the troops to aid them could be facilitated.
The Commandant KRAKEE, in a Jeep and guarded by CKP's, was
instructed to lead the way to the Crematorium and asked whether there
were any open graves. He without shame led the way to the pit referred
to above, which contained large numbers of blackened corpses and on the
way two large piles of naked corpses, all mere skeletons were passed.
Each pile must have contained well over a 100 bodies of men who must
have died within the last few days. It was found that these inmates had
only recently beert*moved to BEIjSEN and to aoconmodate them certain of the
barrack Blocki had been taken over.
/On,﻿Page 6
.38
On completion of this tour and following a conference, a more detailed
inspection of Cajnp No.l was coumenced. A large proportion of the ordinary /
living huts and all so called Hospital accommodation was inspected in det >
Although conditions were much the same in all compounds there were
certain general points arising in each.
Men's Compounds.
No.l. Typhus was on the wane and reached its peak in Larch. It is
understood that it commenced early in February.
No.2. This wfe.s the largest men's compound and contained approx
8,OCX). Typhus had commenced here at a later date than in
Compound 1 and had now reached its peak. There were 266
oases and now cases were still occurring, but the medical
members considered that the worst was over. It was in this
Compound that the story of cannibalism was reported to me
by one of the doctors.
There had been none for the last 2 days but before that there
had been many oases.
No.3. There were many fewer inmates in this compound and no hut set
aside as'a-hospital.
Conditions in many of the huts were indescribable, several
dead bodies could be seen, in some cases moved up to the ends,
in others left just as they lay. Only by entering the huts
could the cases of extr/eme emaciation be seen, so many
obviously past any help however skilled.
The’ gutters outside the huts contained living and dead. There
was no attempt at sanitation whatsoever, the men just squatting
anywhere.
Women's Compounds.
No.l. This was a very large compound containing approximately
23,OCX). Conditions here were much the same as in the men's
compounds except that in a greater proportion there had been
attempt^ to preserve order and some semblance of cleanliness.
There did*seem, however, to me more cases of extreme emaciat-
ion amongst the women that the1 men and in hut 208 conditions
were appalling. Practically every inmate was so weak that
they could hardly raise themselves and the passage was equally
crowded with both living and dead.
Not so many dead bodies were left for any length of time in
the huts or surroundings but in the middle of the compound
and practically adjoining the children's area was a very large
area of naked women piled high. It must have contained many
hundreds.
The hospital block in this compound was a paradise compared
to any others and I can't speak too highly of the efforts of
certain of the women doctors. One woman Gynaecologist was
conducting all the obstetric oases, averaging 5*to 7 per day,
and for some days without any water supply available.
The care that had been taken of the children was also most
noticeable.
In this compound,however, the number of bunks available for
Hospital oases was grossly inadequate. 474 for a total of appro
2,CXX) acutely ill. In many cases there were 3 in each bunk
and the condition in the Typhus ward where there were no bunks
at all was indescribable. The same applied to the men's compou-
nd. The typhus in this compound was well segregated and was
definitely on the wane. There gteve approx 250 cases here. Out
of the 23,000 inmates of -the compound medical personnel esti-
mated that there were not more than 5,000 well.﻿No. 2.
In this compound there were 4*500 women. Only one hut was
set aside as a Hospital and this had no bunks in it. There was no*
segregation of typhus, of which there were 500 cases.
Medical Supplies. These were supplied from a central store in the administrative
block. The medical personnel said that drugs and dressings were
available but very frequently not those most’necessary. Dressings
Dressings had been very short. No vaccines were-available nor any
from of anti-louse powder for the control of typhus. No disinfect-
ants were available.
When the Medical Stores was inspected certain Red Cross boxes were
found containing tinned milk, meats etc. It was explained that
these were part of a very large stock sent by Jewish Societies for
Jews. These had been stolen by the German Guards and none issued*
except very occasionally a small issue of sweets to the children.
Clothing.	Only in those who had obviously been in a short time was
clothing adequate. Large numbers were in German Hospital cloth-
ing. The fact that all corpses were placed in piles naked was, I
think,due to the fact that bodies were stripped to see if any
better articles of clothing could be obtained.
The meals consisted entirely of soup made with meal or
flour and vegetables, mainly carrots, dried cabbage, potatoes,
turnips etc., with a very occasional and scanty sprinkling of small
cubes of meat. The method of distribution was by galvanised con-
tainers carried from the kitchens to the various blocks by the
prisoners themselves. It is obvious therefore that no equality of
distribution could even be organized and the moment anyone became
to weak to fend for himself the chance of obtaining any food
became more and more'remote.
Water.	There had been none for days owing to the failure of the
electricity. It was pitiable to see both men. and women standing
naked in their compounds endeavouring to keep themselves clean from
a teacupful of water.
In this camp there could be no shame and no sex.
Control.
There were certain individuals, one per block, appointed as block
leaders. They were, I supposed, to keep order and organise the general admini-
stration including feeding arrangements for their respective blocks. All signals
e made by whistle.

SUMMARY OF HEALTH STATISTICS. (These figures can obviously only be approx
as it was obviously impossible to keep check of the deaths).
Women. Total number26,185.
Acutely ill in Hospital Huts approx. 2,000.

The hospitalised patients included :-
Typhus	290 total 550 (approx).

6. IRELIMINARi MEASURES TAKEN TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS.
by the afternoon of the first day (16th) 27 watercarts were provided by 8
Corps, and a supply of food in tins for the evening meal. All initial supplies
had obviously to be carefully guarded and issue supervised.
The psychological efiect of this provision was amazing, and each day the
atmosphere in the camp has improved, changing from one of extreme apathy through
the gradual appearance of a spark of vitality to real joy and an interest in life.
The magnitude of the Medical problem in the supervision of special feeding and
supervision of feeding for those cases of starvation cannot be over-estimated.St^^
have already been taken to provide a special gastric diet for these cases and
attempt to mobilise helpers to ensure that the weakest are fed, until such time as
they can be moved to a new hospital area.
General Policy.
(a)	The complete evacuation of Camp 1 and I hope its destruction by fire.
(b)	The establishment of a transit area in the present administrative
building which includes the present bath-house and disinfestors.
Through this will be passed all inmates who are well, and they will be
dusted with AL 63 plus bathing where possible.
(c)	Campwill be evacuated immediately of all fit personnel who will be
removed either to D.P. Camps or accommodation in the Barrack area.
There have been no cases of Typhus in this camp.
(d)	The fit and well in Camp 1 will be bathed, dusted and issued with new
clothing where necessary and evacuated to the far end of the Barrack
area.
(e)	An area of the barrack blocks (8 of which contained German Military
wounded) has been evacuated either to neighbouring German hospitals or
in the case of the Hungarian Guard to other accommodation; this will be
set aside as a hospital area and all acutely ill removed immediately to
this location, passing through a reception area en route. The cases"of
malnutrition and starvation will also be passed through a reception ares
where they can be carefully examined and passed to the appropriate
destination. The German Officers' Mess has,been taken over for the
reception of the worst oases of starvation not suffering from conmuni-
oable infectious disease. These will be nursed by British Nursinr
Officers.
Nursing in the main hospital area will be carried- out under the super-
vision of British male personnel by Prisoner Medical Officers and
Nurses assisted by German Nurses mobilised for the purpose. Large
numbers can be made available.
Special Measures.
(a) The following medical units were moved in on the 17 Apr 43.
One CCS.
One Light Field Ambulance.
Two Field Hygiene' Sections(one oaroe in on first day).
One mobile Bact. Lab.
/(b).﻿(b) Immediately following the first detailed inspection, requests were
made for :-
Protective clothing.
Large quantities of Sulphaguanidine.
Welfare facilities to be put in train including provision
of Postal facilities.
Papers to be ready as soon as required.
Help from UHNRA teams if possible of variefi nationalities
.and Red Gross teams.
Visit of Members of Typhus Commission.
(o) Large stores of captured German drugs and dressings will be made
available.
(d) All forms of clothing and ordnance stores were demanded and where
possible will be provided from captured German stock. Large quantities
are already on the way. Women’s clothing will probably have to be
demanded from German civilian sources.
(e) All food of a luxury nature and suitable for the special feeding of
these patients was impounded from the local Hosp stores and arrange-
ments will be made for resupply of eggs, milk and butter from the
surrounding districts.
7. SUMMARY.
1.	It is unnecessary to enlarge on the horrors of the Concentration Camp.
Nothing like it has ever been seen by anyone who has yet visited the Camp,and
the photographs attached as Appx ’C’ fail to reproduce the worst horrors
which could only be appreciated by seeing the inside of the worst huts.
2.	The Camp No. 1 will be evacuated completely, priority being given to
the acutely ill and the fit and well v/hose removal can proceed simultaneously
Next will leave those suffering from malnutrition with a reasonable expect-
ation of survival, and finally the whole community. During this period
supervised feeding will take place of all those in Camp 1 awaiting removal.
It is considered that this will give the greatest chance and expectation of
life to the greatest number.
3.	All protective measures are being taken and extr^ help demanded. Typhus
inoculation will be carried out on all those requiring it and the necessary
period of quarantine imposed.
Should Bacteriological examination prove the presence of Typhoid to
any extent inoculation by TAB will be considered if supplies are available.
4.	The original estimate of the number of cases of Typhus 1,500 was
probably too high. The dctual figure is probably between 900 - 1,000.
This compi-ises a preliminary report on the conditions existing at the
time of liberation and is based on continuous observation throughout the first 4
days. A further report will be rendered when more accurate statistics should be
available.

DEPOSITION OP NIKOLAJ KALENIKDW (Male) late of Kiev Mironcn^ca Raj on. Mirononica.
Silo Has saw, Russia, sworn before
I am 25 year's of age and I served with a Russian Artillery
1.
Regiment until I was wounded and taken prisoner by the Germans in the
aiitnmw of 1941. I was taken to a hospital in Berlin but after three
weeks I escaped anl went to a Russian civilian labour camp in Berlin -
Marenflede where I lived for about two years. In September 1943 I was
recaptured and sent to Buchenwald Concentration Camp. I was transferred
to Dora Canp on 11th January 1945 and I came to Belsen on 9th April 1945.
2.	After leaving Dora Canp I spent two days in Ellrich Camp and
was in block 19. On 15th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SCAMANS, 86
Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whom I
recognized as the Capo in charge of this block. I knew him by the name
of OSTOWSKI but I have now been informed that his full name is VLADISLAV
OSTROWOSKI.
3.	During the two days I spent at Ellrich Carp one of the prisoners
excreted outside block 19. The punishment for this, ordered by OSTROWOSKI,
was that the men of block 19, totalling approximately 900 men, had to remain
for three hours in a squatting position. OSTROWOSKI beat any prisoners
with a stick if they moved their position or spoke. He hit them cm all
parts of their bodies and as further punishment no food was given at all
that day. I also saw, during the two days at Ellrich, OSTROWOSKI beat
many prisoners for no reason at all. He mainly used a broken soup ladle
handle, which was made of metal and wood. I saw many dead bodies taken
away after the victims had been beaten by OSTROWOSKI.
^ Whilst at Belsen I was in Block 19 and OSTROWOSKI was acting
in the capacity of a camp policeman. When prisoners lined up for food
he would go down the line beating and hitting men with a wooden stick
for no reason at all.
E^-ly one naming, jnot lefor. the Briti.h Ubemted the omp.
One of the sick prisoners, either a
a Frenchman or a Belgian, whom I knew﻿by the name of ALBERT, was so sick that he could not move. I saw OSTHCWO^KI
approach this man and hit him on the head.	He was carrying something in hie
hii^pat the time but I could not see what it was. The blow that the prisoner
received from OSTBOWOSKI resulted in his death as I helped to carry many dead
bodies on to a heap outside Block 13 and the body of this man was amongst then.

1.	I am 21 years of age and I was taken prisoner by the Germans on
# V .	v*' ,, •.*
?th August 1942 whilst serving in an Artillery Regiment of the Russian Arngr,
*	*	•	J	A '	•
near Stalingrad. I was taken to a P.O.W. camp at Milerowo and after passing
through various camps I arrived at Koenigshutte. Here I was made to work in
HP	r-.ii
the ndnes until I escaped in May 1943. I was recaptured in July 1943 at
Kulbaahowo, Poland, and taken to p. geperal prison in Taraow, Poland. In
September 1943 I was transferred to Auschwitz and in October 1944 to
;	,1 , V : T -'t1.	. TX'TrO X.t J '■uTt of Pr- T'~. VC ^ r T O’T
Sachs enhausen. I came to Belaen in January 1945*
2.	Whilst at Belsen I lived in Block 19. On 5th April 1945 a Polish
♦
Capo arrived at Belsen and became block leader of block 19. On 15th June 1945
I was shown by Serjeant *SCAMANS, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of
Military Police, a man whom I recognized as the Polish Capo I have referred to.
I have now been informed that his name is VLADISLAV OSTRDWOSKI,
3.	Prom the day that OSTROWOSKI arrived at Belsen until tire British
arrived, I saw him beat many of the internee^ of block 19. These beatings
were given because prisoners did not hurry on to parade at Apell time or at
meal times. OSTROWOSKI beat these prisoners sometimes with a wooden stick,
sometimes with a rubber truncheon and sometimes with a spade. All the
prisoners were so weak that they could hardly walk. OSTROWOSKI did not seem
to care what part of the body he hit and the prisoners being so weak soon fell
to the groural. He would then kick them as they lay on the ground, mostly in
the region of the neck. Many of the prisoners died as a result of these
beatings aid I have seen the bodies of the victims picked up some hours after-
waris and carried away. There were so many prisoners in the block and so many
beatings by OSTROWOSKI that I am not able to give the names of any of the
victims.

-A -	.. „
• I am 29 years of age and, because I am a Jew, I was taken from
the Ghetto in Wolbrcm in the summer of 1942 and taken to a Labour Camp near
Breslau. In June 1943 I was transferred to a Labour Camp at Grelitz, in
’ August 1944 to Gross Rosen,- in November-1944 *0 Cany Dritte, near Brunswick,
and I came to Belaen in April 1945.
2#	On 19th June 1945 I was shown by No. 14573509 Serjeant EDWARD
DINSDALE, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man
whom I recognised as a Capo in Dritte Cany. I knew him by the name of
Medislaw and I have now been told that his full name is MEDISLArf BURGRAF.
3#	At Cany Dritte I worked in a working party of which BOBGRAF
was in charge. We worked in Hall 3 of a Hermann Goering works near the
cany. BURGRAF was well known for his brutality and I tried my best to
get out of his working party. One day in January 1945 he kicked against
a pile of aeroplane shells that I had stacked and the shells collapsed.
Later on he charged me with sabotage for not stacking the pile properly
and threatened to report me to the Gestapo. This meant the death pmalty
so I inylored him not to report me. He then ordered me to lie over a big
box, face downwards, and he and another Capo, I do not know his name, beat
me with iron bars all over the body. After a time I lost consciousness
and when I awoke I was lying on the floor and experiencing terrible pain.
When the shift was finished and we had to return to our blocks I was unable
to walk and ny comrades had to carry me. I wanted to go straigit to the
Hospital but BURGRAF forbade it. I was swollen and bruised all over the
body. Next morning I was taken to the Hospital where I had to stay for
about a month.

OPERATIONS AT RAVENSBHUCK
DEPOSITION OP	GABAJOWA(feAalo) late of 46 WABSZAWSKA STRASSE, LUKOW, near
LUBLIN, POLAND, sworn before Captain Alexander Mackinlay Porbes, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am 39 year* of age and a Polish Aryan. I was arrested by the
Gestapo in November 1941 because I belonged to an Anti-Nazi Organisation. After
to
5 weeks in prison at RADZYN, Poland,! was transferred /MAJDANEK Concentration
Canp, LUBLIN and in May 1942 to RAVENSBKOCK Concentration Canp where I remained
until I was sent to Belsen Camp on 2nd. March 1945*
Whenl arrived at MAJDANEK Camp there was one block for men and one
for women. The Conmandant was an SS Officer, named OFITZ, aged about 45 years,
5’ 5" tall, n»dium build, red conplexion, blue eyes and bald head. In the
camp was an SS UnterOfficier named flOLLACH about 35 years old, 5* 7" or 8",
slim build, brown face, brown eyes and dark brown hair. Almost every day I
saw GOLLACH beat men with a rubber stick from the end of which wires protruded.
GOLLACH made his victims strip naked first and then beat them across the
buttocks and back; often he knocked prisoners on the ground and beat them,
sometiii.es giving as nary as 50 strokes, so that they could not rise again and
were taken back into their blocks by other prisoners. Later in the day
in a cart. ^	^ °^)
I saw these victims being taken away
3.	During the whole tine I was at RAVENSBRICK the Camp Commandant was an
SS Officer named SURIN. He was about 50 years old, 5’ 9", of medium build,
with ginger hair, blue eyes and a fresh complexion.
I used to work at the Camp in a factory where German uniforms were
made. One of our supervisors there was an SS UnterOfficier named BINDER.
He was about 30 years old, 5* 7" or 8", broad bukld, dark brown hair, dark
eyes anl sallow complexion. Some women were unable to complete their day*
work by evening time. I have seen BINDER knock these women onto the ground
and kick them with his heels on their legs and stomach and on the head.
^ Often he would beat three or four in one evening ,and maxy of those whose faces
or heads he had kicked wex* left bleeding badly. Sometime be beat women
until they were unconscious and other prisoners tB^xmUmxxpt carried them
off to Hospital. Sometimss BINDER beat wcroen during the course of their work
-1-﻿ajnd left them lying on the ground until they could be carried away at the end of
the shift* I am told that one woman whom BINDER had beaten died later in
the same man as in Paragraph 2). Aged about 50, 5' 7" or 8”, thin build, round
shouldered and stoops a little, bald on top with dark hair at sides, with dark
eyes and a pale face. I saw this man use a stick almost every day for beating
women who could not keep up with their work but he only beat them across the
back, and did not knock them down on the ground or kick them like BINDER*
>/C2-
One day between June and Septentoer 1942 'OPITg beat me with a wooden stick about
ten times across ny shoulder blades. This was because I had not used up all
of the cloth that I had cut off, and he accused mp of sabotage. My back was
badly bruised and marks remained for a month.
6* At the Cany there was an SS woman BUCK, about }0 years old, 5' 7",
slim build, blond hair hanging down to her shoulders, blue eyes and pale
complexion, not intelligent by appearance. She had a big Alsatian dog which
she used to encourage to bite women prisoners for very slight offences, such as
breaking can^) rules by walking arm in arm. I have seen many women bitten in the
legs on such occasion so that they had to be treated at the Camp Hospital but
cannot recall any outstanding case. I have also seen BUJH punch women
prisoners in-he face,nftk±ng them fall down, and then kicking them when they were
on the ground. Prisoners in another block told me that during the winter of 1944
they saw HUGH inn a sick old lady of about 60 years who was a German political
prisoner for refusing to stay on Appel: BUJH knocked her down and kicked her
head arel body until she was dead* Her body was then c aimed away to the
Crematorium. I knew this old lady and have not seen her since I was told of her
death.
7.	About twenty different women told me that experimental operations on their
legs had been perfornmd in the Camp Hospital, and I have seen their injuries.
Some of them were partly crippled as a result. In Septentoer 1942 a Polish
, woman Doctor named MACZCA,herself a prisoner and now believed to be in Sweden
told me that 5 women idiom I knew to be perfectly healthy before theywsre taken
to the Hospital had died as a result of experimental injections of Tetanus in
their legs. I managed to get into the Hospital and inside a room saw five bodies
covered by sheets. I could not see their injuries but by their faces identified
th« »• iUKSDA IOT3S, SOFIA IOCKLO.A,	KmOlBKA^MrEU LEFAJCTITZ Md
VERONICA BIASKA. Doctor dUCZA told ito ttotji DootoxsOborhMMr, FI3CHKN and
-2-﻿SCHXDLOfSKY wero responsible for these deaths.
On 18th. Noventer 1942 11 other Polish wo$en prisoners and iqyself
^®rere ordered to report to the Hospital: we were all fit anl well.
ffe had a medical examination by an SS woman Doctor named Oberhauser, she was
about 33 years of age, 5' 5", medium build, very thick legs, brown hair, pale
face and dark eyes, and of attractive appearance. She sent 8 of them
_	IU
i**'- away and told the" four others that we were required for experiments. Ve
objected and said we would rather be shot,but were keft in the Hospital, given
baths and put to bed in a ward where there were already eight other women who
had had operations to both their legs. I saw their injuries, as a result of
which some were partially crippled. Seme had had bones removed, others muscles.
9. On 20th* November 1942 the three other women and Byself were prepared
for an operation by a German nurse whose name wind dwmwiptiun I cannot now
remember. She shaved the lower parts of both legs and then gave us an
injection in the upper part of the right leg. X was then put on a wheel stretcher
trolley and taken into a corridor outside the operating theatre, where an SS
Doctor named ROSENTHAL gave me an injectioh in the arm about 1330 hours, which
made me unconscious. This Doctor is new about 40 years old, 5* 7", very thin
build, blond hair, with long thin chin and nose. I recovered consciousness
about 2300 hours that night. I was sick and the lower part of both ny legs
was very painful. One of the other women had also had her lower legs operated
on and the two others had had operations on both upper and lower legs. We
all felt very ill and vomited: we were in great pain.
10. I underwent further operations on 24th. November 1942, 8th. December 42
and 4fch. January 43. I did not see who performed these operations, but
Doctor 0BEHHA0SER told me before-band that a Doctor FISCHER was going to operate
on us. Doctor MACZCA told me that the operations were done by Professor
GEBHAHD, assisted by Doctor FISCHER, who came from a sanatorium at HCHENLICHEN,

near Rawensbruok: that Doctor MACZD^photegrhphed the results t and that
at the first bone was removed, at the second bacteria were injected and at the
yn>	aJrx^Jr KVj jTwlttx
third more bone was removed. X niwer saw GKHHAKD, though I heard while working
at the sanatorium at HCKBNLICHUf that he lived there with his family.
11. On 26th. November 1942 ( 2 days after ny second operation) I ima taken
into another room and although I was covered by a sheet I could see that
Doctors 0BEH1AIBER and ROSENTHAL were there accompanied by two other SS Doctors
(i) FISCHER, now aged about 36, 5* 10", broad build, blond wavy hair and freah
complexion (ii) 3CHXDL0WSKI about 45 years old, 5' 5", slim build, blond hair,
-3-﻿daric eyea and an unhealthy appoaraase. I saw Doctor FI3CHEH extract
>
pua from the wounda in ay log and put it into a metal tube.

r^-
The other three wcuen who were taken to Hcapital with me all had
muscle* removed by sisdlar operations, and I saw their injurlee. Of them
HSTiSNA HEGIEfi and STANXSLAWA C21AJK0WSKA, who had operations to both upper anl
lower parts of both legs, underwent 5 operations altogether: mapta GBABOWSKA
had four operations, like ayself.
13.	After four months in Hospital I was returned to Block 24 to which
«	•	• v <
women who had undergone similar operations were sent. We were allowed to rest in
bed for 6 months, after which^ used to work there, sitting down knitting
"i i<..j i'i riv-.rdi'i,1 ei .'5	"v-u/f 3//.'’ _ i .-.r '?lJl .	-	_ Z
stockings.
14«	In about Septanfcer 1943 I saw five women from Block 24, HELENA
RAKOWSKA, ANIELA SOBOLEWSKA, MARIA ZIELONKA, ANIELA OKOIflEWSKA. and ROSALIA
^	GUTEK, all of whom I knew had been operated on, taken into an Air Raid Shelter
by an SS woman. Later they got on a lorry with some SS men and were driven
away out of the Gamp. About twenty minutes later I heard shots from the direction
in which the lorry had gone. I did not see or hear of ary of these women again.
I cannot now name or describe ary of the SS people.
15.	On 4th. February 1945 there were about 60 women in Block 24* One
of them h®Lrd that Commandant BORIN had given orders that we were all to be
sent to GROSS ROSEN Camp on the following day. On the next day a girl/who
worked in the Record Office came to the block and told us we were all to be shot
that afternoon: We an. moved out immediately into other blocks, assuming
>	false names and numbers, and I heard no more about being moved to GROSS ROSEN
or being shot. Soon afterwards I was moved to Belsen Caap in compary with
STANISLAWA MCHALJK.
16.	I still have pain and weakness in both ny legs. My feet swell and I
can only walk for about I5- hours. I have not mens^Saated for three years,
and have low back ache and pain in the head and spine, though I cannot say if this
results from the operations.

GAHWDLIN, near WARSAW, POLAND, sworn before Certain ALEXANDER MACKINLAY BOHBES,
R, A», Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team*
1*	I am 38 years of age and a Polish Aryan. I was arrested by the
Gestapo in April 1941 because I was a* member of an Anti-Nazi Organisation.
After a month in prison at BIALA FCELASKA, I was transferred to LUBLIN prison
and 5 months later to Ravensbruck Concentration Camp which I reached in
Sept enter 1941*	From there I came to Belsen on 3rd* March 1945.
2*	At KTATiA PQDLASKA three Gestapo officials, men whose names or descriptions |
I cannot now remember, beat ard. kicked me in order to obtain information about
other members of this Anti-Nazi Organisation* One of the men held me over
a table while another beat me with a rubber truncheon. My brother and a
•oiran named Rafaela Mazurek w^ere arrested at the same time. X saw oy
brother's face been injured, though I did not see him beaten and am
told he was shot later at AUSCHWITZ. Rafaela Maaurek told me that the
three men stripped her and bound her feet and hands then put her on a table
arxi beat her with a stick until she was unconscious. They also stamped on
her bare feet with their boots and had stuck needles under the nails of both
her big toes*
During the whole time that I was at RAVEfBBKOGK the Camp Commandant
was an SS Officer named SUKCN. He was about 50 years, 5* 9" tall, medium
build with a pale face and ginger hair.
4*	In January 1942 I had a bad throat and went to the Camp Hospital to
get	treatment for it* Other women were there waiting for treatment
anl an 35 Doctor named SONNTAG was present. He was about 45 years old,
6» 2" and of medium build. I did rot see him give ary medical treatment to
the prisoners, instead I saw him slap about ten of the women across the face
ami kick them} I thereupon ran out of the hospital.
5*	I was told that operations wars being performed in the Hospital
on women for experimental purposes and I ssw and spoke to women who had
so been operated upon. In September 1942 a Polish woman prisoner who
-1-﻿worked in the Hospitel told me that 5 women had died there aa the result
0*
of experimental operations pt their legs. I sneaked into the Hospital
and saw 5 bodies lying in a room covered over with sheets. I could
not see their injuries but by their faces recognised them as being ,
ALHKDA HSUS, ZOPIA KICELOWA, KAZIMTERA KURDWSKA , ANIELA MP-ANOWIG&
and WERCHXKA KEASXA; they were all dead.
6. On 5th. January 1943 I was told by ny Block Leader to go to the
Hospital as I was wanted there . I would not go of ny own aooord
as I was quite healthy. At 11 o'clock that night an 3S woman whose
name or description I cannot now remember fetched me from ny block and
took am to the Hospital where I was put in a ward with 8 other women
who had all had experimental operations on their legs. I saw their
injuries. Ond woman, BOGUMLA BOMBINSKA had had operations on the
upper and lower part of her legs and also on the lower part of her

DSPOemCW OP SEVER KDBRJNER (Male) late of Senatortka 18, Czenstochau, Poland,
seorn before	^ ^	^
l^qji	K CUk^.,	MAK. .
X.	I am JO yeare of age and, because I am a Jew, I was arrested in
June 1942 awl taken to the Ghetto in Czenstachau. I was transferred to an
iron works in the same town in March 1943 from where I escaped in June 1944.
After a month I gave myself up and was sent to a prison in the same place.
I was transferred to Gross Rosen in August 1944-, to Cas^ Dritte in September
1944 and finally to Belsen in April 1945.
2,	On 20th June 1945 I was shown by No. 14573509 Serjeant EDWAJB
DINSDALE, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man
whom I recognized as a Capo in Dritte Camp. I knew him by the name of
Burgraf I have now been told that his full name is MEDISLAW BURGRAP.
j.	At Camp Dritte, BURGRAP was in charge of the working party to
which I belonged. We worked in a shell factory, a branch of the Hermann
Goering works, in day and night shifts. One night in February 1945 a
e«XLA W flCHTEl-
friend of	^whnna name I 4» not know hut who came from Cracow, was very
weak and could not work as quickly as the others. BURGRAP approached him
and coumenced to beat him with a thick square stick all over the head, face
and body. His eyes became very swollen and he had a bleeding nose. My
friend was unable to continue working and had to sit down. When we left
the factory at the end of the shift he was unable to walk and another man
and nyaelf assisted him to the Camp. When we arrived at our block ny
friend started shouting and throwing his bedding about. He spoke in a
confused manner and generally behaved strangely, as if his mind was
unbalanced. BURGRAP called a Warden of the Hospital and I assisted the
Warden to carry the man to the Hospital. Two days later friends in the
Hospital told me that	had died. I have not seen him since that
date.
4.	One day in January 1345 I saw BURGRAP beating ay friend WOLF
PLATKEWITCH, who worked in the same shell factory a* Dritte. He hit him
partly with his fists and partly with a wooden stick wn the face. I do
not know the reason for the beating but I noticed that some shall, which﻿^BGRAF tell him that PLATKEWITCH had ooamitted sabotage. Both Capos then
took him into a small wire-partitioned place where they laid him over a bo*
face downwards. They then commenced to beat him with iron bars all over
the body until he lost consciousness and fell off the bo*. The two Capos
then went away. He was unable to work any more that day and had to be
carried back to his block at the and of the shift. His body was b^tly

2.	I was greeted at the gate by a group of officers and Other
Ranks, among whom were a V/ehrmacht Officer, a Hungarian Captain, and
JOSEP KRAMER. KRAMER and the Hungarian Officer appeared to be the
spokesmen of the group. I was not at that time aware of KRAMER's
identity as Commandant of the Prisoners' Camp.
3*	My preliminary conversation with KRAMER elicited the inform-
ation first, that the perimeter of the Camp was guarded by several
hundred Wehr macht and several hundred Hungarian troops, second, that the
camp was for criminals of two types and for homosexuals. Only in answer
to a direct question from me did KRAMER admit that it also contained
political prisoners. Third, that KRAMER and the others were reluctant
to allow British officers into the Camp, and, indeed, appeared surprised
and disconcerted by the suggestion that any British would wish to enter.
The reasonjgiven against entering the Camp were, by the Hungarian officer,
strongly back by KRAMER, that Typhus was rampant, and by KRAMER alone
that the prisoners were then quiet and an announcement from my
Amplifier would cause disturbance, and finally, on my insistence that
I intended to enter, that he could not allow me to do so without the
permission of Colonel SCHMIDT, Commanding the Wehrmacht at the
Komraandamtur in Carp No 2.
4.	I overrode objections and insisted on entering the Camp
in order to carry out my orders to go round the Camp and make the
announcement over my Amplifier framed by General Barker. On making ray
announcement for the first time in the Mens' Camp a considerable number
of the prisoners surged towards ray Truck. A soldier of the Wehrmacht
armed with a rifle fired initially over their heads and continued to
fire single shots lowering his rifle steadily until it became obvious
that his next shot would hit a prisoner, at which stage I stopped him
5.	As the prisoners came towards my truck in increasing numbers
I saw prisoners, whom I afterwards discovered to be Block Readers,
weilding pieces of wood which appeard to be portions of packing cases,
with which they struck the prisoners in a way which gave the impression
that such striking was in the nature of a Drill. The force used was
quite unnecessary and gratuitous and I saw at least one case where a
man was heavily struck a second time when already on the ground from the
first blow. On my subsequent experiences of the prisoners during the
week following it became perfectly clear that they could be controlled,
given a little patience, without the use of such methods.
6.	'	I saw no corpses on first going through the Camp and subse-
quently discovered that they had been moved to places beliind the Barrack
Huts where they could not be seen, but the stench and pitiable condition;
of the prisoners was such that I remarked to KRAMER "You have made a fine
-1-﻿Hell of this place” to which he replied "It has recently become so".
Neither then or at any other time did KRAMER show any sign of shame
or contrition at the general state of the Camp.
7.	Having made my announcement I left the Camp to meet
Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, as previollfLy arranged, at the Kommandantur ^
in Camp No 2. While there a telephone call from the SS in the Prisoners
Camp to the Wehrmacht in the Komraandantur was received to the eft ect that
a disturbance was being caused by the prisoners in the Camp.
8,	Accordingly, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor proceeded to the
Prisoners1 Camp, taking me with him as interpreter. In the open at the
entrance to the Prisoners' Camp KRAMER was questioned by Lieutenant-Colonel
Taylor through me, admitted that he was Commandant responsible for .he
Prisoners' Camp, and when ordered to give up his arms stated that he could
no longer be responsible for administering the Camp unless he was allowed
to retain them. He stated that they were necessary in order to protect
essential stores, by which he meant, he explained, the food. He then stated
that the prisoners were having two meals daily, each consisting of soup,
but that bread was very short and there had recently been none for days
at a time. He further stated that the normal water supply had broken down
and that prisoners were obliged to get water from concrete basins in the
Camp, from which I subsequently saw them drawing water and drinking water
in which they were also obliged to wash. Subsequently, most of the
concrete basins were found by the Medical Officers to contain several
corpses. KRAMER further stated that in the Camp was two days' supply
of rations.
9.	/	We then repaired to KRAMER' s Officejf where he appeared
entirely at his ease and anpeared to have lost his previous reluctance
to admit anybody to the Camp. In reply to a question, he stated that
all records had been destroyed on orders from BERLIN, with the exception
of those relating to two thousand prisoners, but when he sent for these
he was informed by an N.C.O. that they no longer existed. Brigadier
Glyn Hughes, Deputy Director of Medical Services, Second Army, joined
Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor and myself in KRAMER's Office at this stage.
10.	Shortly afterwards, at approximately 1800 hours, a Wehrmacht
officer came to report "that the Kitchens were being stonued" and the
party proceeded to the Kitchen in question to investigate, consisting
of Brigadier Hughes, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor and myself, KRAMER
and two or three of his SS Staff, together with the Wehrmacht officer
already mentioned. The Cook in charge of the Kitchen in question showed
us- a cauldron in which the level of soup was some six inches from the
top and stated that that araount of soup had been taken. This constituted
the storming of the Kitchens as described by the Wehrmacht officer.
The question wasthen put to KRAMER as to whether there were any other
similar troubles connected with rations and he replied "Yes, the potato
patch", and the whole party then proceeded to this patch, which consisted
of potato plants covered with straw and was situated on the right hand
side of the Main roadway through the Mens' Camp some thiry yards from the
Western Gate. I do not remember whether I heard any shooting on the way down
to this patch. I saw one old woman scrabbling hysterically and almost crazily
in the patch for potatoes and told her to take what she had got and return
to her Block. She renlied vlth a pathetic and impassioned plea< to be
'allowed to remain, and KRAMER remarked contempjuously "There, you see,
that s our problem". At least two, probably more, uniformed Germans
who might have been 3S or Y/ehrmacht were sta ding at the patch but
I did not notice whether they were armed. The Brigadier called attention
to a number of dead and seriously wounded bodies lying in the patch.
The wounded were ordered to be removed and KRAMER Idmself was ordered
to carry away one of the d ad.
11.	At a time during this period which I cannot now exactly
remember, a number of the prisoners started to surge thr ugh one of the
Gates apparently making for the Kitchens or Pood Stores. KRAMER was
ordered to stop them but protested that he would be unable to do so
unless he were given arms. A British soldier was ther upon detailed
who stopped them without arms and without any noticeable difficulty.
-2-﻿
12#	Throughout tte days following the 15th April 1945 I acted
as interpreter for Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, and as his Liaison Officer
with German officers of the i/ehrmacht in Camp No 2 and 35 in Camo No 1.
During this period I frequently saw the Y/ehrmacht officers from Camp
No 2 who were continually going in and out of the S3 Buildings in the
Prisoners' Camp and on many occasions stood in groups talking with the
S3 in the Priosners' Camp. It was perfectly obvious to me from the
Wehrmacht officers' behaviour that thay v/ere accustomed to have dealings
with the Prisoners' Camp and were familiar figures t’nere. Similarly^
the Hungarian Office^ was very : iteh in e ^Lence, particularly in Camp No
and I formed a similar impression about u. «r.	' These remarks apply to,
among others, OBEBST HARRIES, the Wehrmacht Camp Commandant in Camp
No 2 and OBERST SCHMIDT, the Commander of the Panzer Training School in
Camo No 2. I saw the latter at the Headquarters of 159 Brigade, a day
or two before the 15th April 1945 and. was informed that he was there for
the purpose of negotiating the Truce relating to BELSEN Cangp.
13,	On one occasion, on the 16th April 1945, I was
obliged to take from a Hungarian soldier in Gang) No 2 a stout stick
with v/hich he was engaged in severely beating one of the prisoners.
I did not obtain his name.
1A.	In regard to the Wehrmacht officer and the Hungarian Captain

but could identify them easily. Their descriptions are as follows:-

MURDERS AT WOLANOW & BLIZIN CAMPS.
DEPOSITION OF HELLA BLATMAN L?gmal^) lat^pf 18 Ogrodowa, Schidlcwetz, Poland,
7 / /<<Lt+*/\UA-
sworn before Cap^eda* .Royal Artillery, Legal Staff,
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 32 years of age and, because I am a Jewess, I was arrested
on 22nd September 1942 and taken to Wolanow Carp where I remained until June
1943« I was then transferred to Blizin Camp and on 15 th July 1944 I was
transferred to Auschwitz. I came to Belsen on 1st January 1945.
2.	In September 1942, before I was taken to Wolanow Cany, I was
present at a Jewish festival which was held in the town n of Schidlowetz.
I was standing in Radomska Strasse, which is near the entrance to the Synagogue,
when the people started to come out from the service. Untersturmfuhrer
SCHITZER was standing near the Synagogue also, and I saw him take the first
man to come out of the Synagogue in his car and drive away in the direction
of the cemetary. I do not know this man’s name. I, and other people who
saw the incident, walked directly to the cemetary and when we arrived there
found the body of the man lying face downwards on the ground. I did not
see any wounds but from the way the body was lying I knew that the man waa
dead. Only about ten minutes elapsed between the time I saw the man getting
into SCHITZER’s car and when I saw his dead body in the cemetery.
3.	In November 1942, whilst at WOLANOW Cany, I was told by ny brother-
in-law that SCHITZER had taken 14 men from a working party, 14 sick men from
the camp and 2 women, also from the cany, to another part of the cany and had
shot them all with a machine gun. Ify brother-in-law said that he had seen the
shooting. He told me that ny husband was one of the 14 men from the working
party who were shot. Ity brother—in-law's name is -fliCHIL BLATKAN. He said
that after the shooting all the bodies were put into a pit.	E2CKEL later
gpve me ny husband’s watch and some money which he had had.	I later visited
the place where I had been told the shooting took place and there found some
of ny husband* s papers including his photograph. I was also told that
SCHITZER went rouni and picked the people out to be shot for no apparent
reason. The last time I saw SICHIL was at Auschwitz.
*	About . fortoisfct after the .tor. inoident I retuihed to .he <***
“I-﻿after finishing work and was told "by a prisoner, whose name I cannot remember,
that	had been taken and shot, I went to a field in the caag?
ex mit
land there found some 140 bodie^i They had all been shot, Wy Father-in-law
was not amongst them, I saw him later and he told me that on Apell SCHTTZEfi
and two other S.S. men had picked out these 140 people, about 70 of whom were
sick, taken them to the field and shot them with a machine gun, I waa working
in the Hospital later when two of these men were brought in suffering from
tullet wounds. One was wounded in the leg but I cannot remember where the other
man was wounded, I dressed their wounds, I was later told by HXCHIL that
SCHITZER had visited the Hospital, taken these two men away and shot them. I
did not see these two men again..
5,	One Sunday in May 1943 fifteen men were brought into Wolanow Gang}
from Radom Gang). These men were called 1 Interlectuals*. SCHITZER and two
other S.S. men brought them into the Gang* and took them to the same place where
all the other people had been shot. SCHITZER made them undress completely and
then shot them all with a machine gun. After the shooting I saw SCHITZER and
the other two S.S. men go round the bodies and I saw SCHITZER shoot one through
the head. I believe that SCHITZER shot this man then because he had failed to
kill him with the machine gun. The bodies were inmediately put into a pit
already dug for that purpose. I myself saw the whole of the above incident
which I have related. I would describe SCHITZER as aged about hO years,
5ft. lOins. in height, well built. I do not know the names of the other two
S.S. men nor can I remember what they looked like.
An S.S. man named Untersturmfuhrer HELL was at HLIZIN Camp while
I was there. An Apell was held every morning and evening and at every Apell
I attended I saw NELL pick out a number of men or women. Some of these men
and women had had their numbers taken during the day for some offence, usually
foTirjng to a member of the opposite sex, and the others were just picked out
apparently for no reason. Those so picked had to go to the front of the parade
and after the men had removed their trousers and the women their knickers, had
to bend over a chair. They were then beaten by NELL who used a stick about 3ft.
long and 1 inch in diameter. It may have been an iron or wooden stick, and
was covered with leather. On the average each person received 25 strokes
on their buttocks at the hands of NELL, and at the end of the beatings their
buttocks were black and blue. After these beatings the people who had been
beaten had to continue with their work in the normal manner.

4﻿7.
In May 1944,	before I left HLIZIN Can?), I was present on
an evening Apell which was held at b.p.su Three men were brought on parade
and taken to NELL. I saw NELL pull out his pistol and shoot each of the men
in turn through the head. They fell to the ground and their bodies were
removed by a Jewish Policeman named SCHLAMEK MINSBERG and some other prisoners.
Their bodies were taken out of the Camp and into a wood where all the dead were
usually buried. The Jewish Policeman's job was to keep order in the camp, and
from him I learned that the three men had been shot by NELL because they had
be«» accused of attempting to escape. I would describe NELL as aged about 40
years, about 5ft.lOins. in height, dark conplexion, thin face, dark hair,
Hitler-like moustache and slim build. I would also describe MINSBERG as aged
about 25 years, about 5ft.l0ins. in heigit, dark complexion, large face, brown
hair big build, clean shaven and very strong.

Captain R.A.
I HEREBT CERTIFY that I have accurately translated this Affidavit to the said
﻿IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
EXHIBIT " '7S
DEPOSITION OP H:
Captain
(Female) late of Plocky, Hungary, sworn before
Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No, 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am 35 years of age. Neither ny husband nor I are Jewish.
. u
I was arrested in Cracow in June 194° because the Gestapo suspected me of
anti-German sympathies and found me in possession of an anti-German pamphlet.
I was in prison for four months at 'the Gestapo prison, Cracow. I was sent
to Ravensbruck Camp in October 1940 and subsequently to Auscbwitz-Berkenau
»
in October 1941, thence to Belsen-Bergen in December 1944.
2,	I recognize No, 2 on photograph Tt/hJ?. as S.S. Aufseherin IRMA
GRESE, I knew her first in Ravensbruck in 1941 but^I know of nothing against
her	that time. She was Blockleader/andsuBsequently in charge of the
punishment company in Auschwitz from 1942 to 1944-. ^She was in charge the
pimashmCTVt^^iiroe^^for' S^aonths in^43. ^^ also i^^^ishment
company and during the time that GRESE was in charge^ we Wbre anployed outside
the Camp in a sand-pit. There were 700 - 800 women working in this company
some of which were detailed to dig sand and fill iron trucks with the sand
and others had to push these trucks along a narrow guage railway. The place
in which we worked was suirounded by a strand of wire about three to four feet
high and we were not allowed to go outside this wire boundary. There were
twelve guards placed at intervals around the wire. It was the practice of
GRESE to pick out certain of 6v»/women prisoners and order than to get
something from the other side of the wire. She always worked with interpreters
When the prisoners approached the wire they were challenged by the guard but
as GRESE usually picked out non-Gennans they did not understand the order and
walked on anl were shot. Some evm of the prisoners who did understand
German and knew it was death to cross the wire did so because they were too
weary and ill to bother. Occasionally a ffiard would not shoot but would
foree the prisoner to return to the woricing party. I ^3elf *** called
as a witness at an en^ixy which was held by the political department on a
guard who refused to shoot prisoners which GRESE had ordered to cross the
4 T -s	fled the guard who was handcuffed. In ny
wire. At the enquiry I identified me guax
-1-﻿presence the guard stated that the ■women were being worked too hard and that
GHESE was purposely sending them to the wire so that they mmld be shot, Die
next day the guard was on duly again and GEESE had gpne. I next saw hear in
Belsen in February or March 1945 as a Rapportfuherln.
3.	Whilst GEESE was in charge of the working party she always carried
a rubber truncheon. She was responsible for at least JO deaths a day
resulting from her orders to cross the wire but many more on occasions. It
was always my job, ordered by GEESE, to count the dead and I, together with
some other women, used to load the bodies into one of the railway waggons
after working hours. The bodies were subsequently removed by ambulance. I
know two of the women who helped me on these occasions^ their names are .	/ X
T/ /oa*j /Ai, ^ Vu*<« >9u-S't*'	aw	Tuu
GANINA STASICKA and KaBOLA MEK0^4 I know the name of one irtternee vdio was
shot by a guard when ordered to cross the wire. It was ANNA GUTEESVEISS of
Czeczowics, near Cracow. In fact I wrote to her son to tell him that his
Mother had died. It is possible that orders to cross the wire were not in
every case given by GEESE because the Capos used to try it but it is almost
certain that GEESE was responsible in almost every case.
4.	I identify No. 3 on photograph 19 as an S.S. woman who was at
Auschwitz during 1943/4. I knew her by the name of BORMANN and have now
beai told that her full name is JUAI#A BORMANN. She was the worst hated
person in the Camp. At first she was in charge of the clothing store and
then in charge of labour. She always had with her a large dog which she
set on to the prisoners. On one occasion when I was undergoing a minor
punishment,	it was in the sunnier of 1944 as near as I can ranember,
I was kneeling down with ny hands in the air and I saw BORMANN approach a
prisoner, a female, who was going towards the offices. BORMANN stopped
the woman and took something out of the woman’s pocket. She then hit
the prisoner with her right hand and then clasping her by the hair threw
the woman to the ground. BORMANN was holding the dog by a strap in her
left hand and when the woman was lying on the ground she let the dog go
aad it bit tiie woman severely. When the dog had finished the woman was
V^IV	and examined the woman There was no movementSom toe body and
^ four prisoners were instructed to take the body away on a stretcher to
Block 25 which was notorious as the death Slock that is the block to which
people were taken when they were dying or where they were lodged prior to
-2-﻿being taken to the Gas Chamber.
5.	In 1942 not long after I had been at Auschwitz, BOHMANN found some
cigarettes and photographs in	my	bed* For	this she beat	me on the face with
her hani and then set her dog	on	to me. I	was bitten in	the left arm near the
elbow. BOSMAHN walked me to the Hospital and I was there for six weeks. I
believe BORMANN called the dog off only because she was a sadist and enjoyed
.^ning that sort of thing. I received an official beating for having cigarettes
when I came out of hospital. BOKMANN left Auschwitz in the sunmer of 1944,
6.	I recognize No. 5	on	photograph	22 as an S.S.	Oberaufseherin at
Belsen. I knew her by the name	of EHLEKT and I have now	been told that her
full name is HERTA EHLEKT. Two weeks before the English came, it was in
early April, the roll call at ny block was incorrect and EHLERT beat me with
her hand,but not very much,but she stopped the food the next day for the whole
block as a punishment.
7.	I recognize No. 6 on photograph 22 as an S.S. woman who was at
Auschwitz. I knew her by the name of VOLKENRATH and have now been told that
her full name is ELISABETH VOLKENRATH. She was responsible for selections
for the Gas Chamber at Auschwitz Camp from Block 18 where I lived. I attended
seven selection parades and she and S.S. Rapportfuhrer TAIJB^	ft U,
made all the selections.^ On one occasion out of a block containing 1400
prisoners there were only about 300 left after the selections had been made.
I left Auschwitz in November 1944 and next saw VOLKENRATH at Belsen in February
1945, when she said to me that Germany had lost the War and we should all be
hanged,
8.	I knew an S.S. Oberaufseherin DREOHSEL at Auschwitz. I would
describe her as about 30 years of age, 5fb. 4ins. in height, very thin with
bright brown thin hair. She has two protruding front teeth, a long thin
nose and pale complexion. She walked with her head bent forward. She was
responsible for selections for the Gas Chamber and I myself have seen her
doing this many times.	U/Uit'
9>	x knew an S.S. Arbeitdienstfuhrerin, at Auschwitz. I would
describe her as about 28 years of age, about 5ft.8ins. in heigit, very
blonde hair (natural) , straight, and worn in an upward style, blue eyes,
blonde eyebrows, small mouth, round face, healthy complexion, slim build,
good even teeth, beautiful, good figure, and very smart in her dress. This
«oman was in charge of the transport columns which arrived at Auschwitz fron
-3-﻿time to time. These transport columns consisted of people who were to be
_ «^#nninated at once and they did not spend ary time in the n»mp. she
^^Ped to lead the columns to the gas chamber and whore there were babies in
arms she ordered them to be thrown into a hole which was connected to a stove
and they were burnt alive* X was employed in cleaning up the ground near
the crematorium and I saw this happen many times. HASSE always wore a pistol
but I never saw her use it - only to threaten people.
10.	I recognise No. 5 on Hiotograph 1 as an S3 man who was chief cook
at Belsen. I have now been told that his name is KARL FLRAZICH. A week
before the English arrived I went to fetch food from the kitchen for ny block
and the internees who were queuing for their food started to push and FLRAZICH,
$
who always stood on the steps at the entrance to the kitchen, shot a girl with
his pistol. The girl,A was pregnant, was shot in the arm and as she belonged
to ny block I took her to the Hospital. She became unconscious end died whilst
J Cm** ooaj utkj /At doii oA* <***> 'V'&y oAjJ'Uy Afc */W. - a//	_
I was there.^/ I know this because a Doctor examined her and told me she was dead.
% block was next to the kitchen and I saw FLRAZICH shooting repeatedly at the
internees many of whom fell down and were flung on to a heap.
11.	I knew an SS woman called FRANZ who was chief cook at Auschwitz.
I would describe her as aged about £2, height about 5' 9", hair black(straight and
parted on left side), eyes green, complexion ruddy, very small nose, good teath(even),
One gold tooth in left upper jaw visible when laughing, round face, thin black
eyebrows, small mouth, short neck, plumply built, appears to waddl.e when walking,
red
small white hands, wears a plain ring and a ring with a large/stone on the 3rd.
finger of right hand, dresses neatly, very clean and does not use makeup. I met
her often when I went to get the bread for ny block at the bread store and I have
seen her beat many people with a stick for no apparent reason. She was at
uschwitz alj. the time I was there.
__2.	I recognise No. 1 on photograph (V'Vl as an SS man whom I knew at
Auschwitz and Belsen.^/1 knew him b/ the name of HANSI and I have now been
told that his full nane is HENRICH SCHREIER. I first met 3CHHKIER in the winter
t
of 1942/3 at Auschwitz. He was in charge of a Strafekonmanda in which I was working.
He spoke to everyone in the Strafekonmando and asked them their jobs in civil life
and when I told him that I was a Professor of Music he at once became interested.
He talked all day about music and politics. He spoke badly of the Germans and Bald
that the War was already lost. One day I was sentenced to 12 days in the bunker
for smoking. SCHREIER was in charge of this bunker. He told me that he was in
charge of the political department and that he would tell roe all that was going﻿p
J

V
on if I would play the violin for him. I agreed to do so and ho brought me
"violin. He told me that 10 people in the bunker were to be hanged
'and many to be gassed the next day. I played ‘Mother Love' to him and he
told me that he had no mother and if I played it again he would shoot me.
He also asked me to play something Riananian or French and when I asked for
Ur
music he said he would writeA for me which he did. When I had finished
playing for him ha wrote on the door-post 'England will come to help*.
13.	I afterwards spoke to an American boxer named JACOB who was in the
bunker and he told me that SCHHEIER was an intelligent man and spoke
Rumanian, French, Polish, Russian, German and English. SCHHEIER spent almost
each day in my cell and I formed the opinion that he was not normal. He told
me that hs was a homosexual. After I was released from the bunker SCHHEIER
said that he wanted me to join the camp band but I could not do so whilst I
was in the punishment party. In an attempt to get me off the punishment party
SCHHEIER arranged a meeting for me with HESSLER whom I identify as No.l on
photograph 9. HESSLER told me that I had to stay in the punishment party.
14.	I saw SCHHEIER whilst I was at Belsen in December 1944 or January
1945. I spoke to him about 3 times. The last time I se.w him was at 2100
hours one evening about three weeks before the British came. He came to ny
roan and he was very dirty. He said that he had been working in the woods
flpri buried some secret papers. I said that I would like to see where
they were and he agreed to take ms. We went out of the camp to a spot
between the crematorium and the sand-pit and he shewed roe where five or six
boxes were buried. They were only covered with a little earth which he scraped
away and I actually saw the boxes which he said contained the last papers the
Germans possessed and ammunition. On 31a‘t. June 1945 I showed Captain A.J. POX,
General List, D.A.P.M. 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police,
where the boxes had been buried. They were no longer there.
15.	One day in Belsen SCHHEIER showed me three passports or identity cards.

DEPOSITION OP JOSEP KRALER, SS Haijptstux'rni'ulirer and Conanandant of Belsen
Concentration Cainp, sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Germ,
Royal • Artillery, Commanding , Noel War Crimes Investigation Team.
I..	I relinquished c ommand of Struthof Natzweiler in May 19 4A aad
handed over to Sturrabannfuhrer HARTffMSTEIN. At this time and for at least
a year previously BIKK was commanding Sohixmeck, but there was no official
connection between Sohixmeck and Stmthof* There was a Gestapo officer attached
to me during my period at Stx*uthof -sasL his name was WDCHNER and he was sent by the
Gestapo at Stuttgart. According to the district allocation Struthof should
have been, in my opinion, in Strassbourg^ but I believe that in any case
Strassbourg Gestapo depended on Stuttgart.
2.	With reference to the orders I received to gas certain women
and despatch them to Strassbourg University as sworn by me before Commandant
JADIN of the Prench Army, I give the following details:-
The orders I received were in writing signed by order of Reichsfuhrer
HIMMLER by	gruppenfuhrer CLICKS. As nearly as I can remember they
stated that a special transport would bm arrive % from Auschwitz and that
the people on this transport were to be killed and their bodies sent to
Strassbourg to Professor HULL'. It further said that I should communicate
with Professor HIRT as to how the killing was to take place. This I did
and was given by HIRT a container of gas crystals with instructions how
to use them. There was no regular gas chamber in Struthof but he described to
me how an ordinary room might be used. I do not know ary more of the
Professors concerned with HIRT but I do know that there was in one of
the departments a Professor BICKBHBACH.
^	The first time I saw a gas chamber proper was at Auschwitz.
It was attached to the crematorium. The complete building containing the
crematorium and gas chamber was situated in Camp No.2 (Birkenau) of which I
was in command. I visited the building on ny first inspection of the camp
after being there for three days, but for the first eight days I was there it
not working* After eight days the first transport, from which gas chamber
>1-	s


was﻿(Lablest)—For use only on letter packets not exceeding 10’ x 5
w.b.46-237
■victims vrere selected, arrived and at the same time I received a written order
from HQESS, 'Mao commanded the whole of Auschwitz Gamp, that although the
^as chamber and crematorium were situated in iqy part of the Camp, I had no
jurisdiction over it whatever* Orders in regard to the gas chamber were, in
fact, always given by HOESS and I am firmly convinced that he received such
orders from Berlin# I believe that had I been in HOESS's position and received
such orders, I would have carried them out because even if I had protested it
would only have resulted in my being taken prisoner nyself* My feelings about
orders in regard to the gas chamber were to be slightly surprised and wonder
to myself whether such action was really right.
4.	In regard to conditions at Belsen, I say once more that I
did everything I could to remedy them* In regard to the food, the prisoners
throughout March and April 1945 got their full entitlement, and in my opinion
this entitlement was perfectly sufficient for the healthy prisoner but from
the middle of February onwards sick people began to come in and I felt they
should have more food. I sent my Messing N.C.O., Unterscharfuhrer MULLER,
to the food depots in Celle and Hanover but he was told that no further food
could be issued because we were already getting our entitlement, I did in
fact get some food frcm the food store in the Wehrmacht Gamp at Belsen but
it would have been no use ny asking for more from them because they were not
Try correct authorised depot*
Xn regard to accommodation, when X was ordei’ed to take
30,000 more people in early April, when the Camp was^more than full I appealed
to Lieutenant General BOIKEBURG in the Kcmmandatur# in the Wehrmacht Camp
at Belsen and it was he who arranged for 15,000 prisoners to be lodged in the
barracks in that Gamp. He had to get special permission over the telephone
to do this, I never appealed to the General for help on the food situation
or any other difficulties because I knew that lie would not have been able to
help me in that he had no jurisdiction. I do not consider th^t I should
have appealed to him because I knew that he could not have helped. Furthermore
31 do not believe that anybody in Germany could have altered the food entitlement
for the prisoners in the Camp because I do not believe that the food was
available. It surprises me very much to hear that there were large and
adequate stocks of food in the Wehrmacht Coup. Nevertheless I still feel
that an appeal to the General would have been useless.
X have been told that some of my 33 staff were guilty of
ill-treatment and brutality towards the prisoners. I find this very difficult
KJ-

' believe and I would trust them absolutely. To the best of ny belief they
never corrmitted ar\y of fences against the pidsonei-s. X regard rnyself as responsible
for their conduct and do not believe that ary of them would have infringed ay
orders against ill-treatment or brutality.
7®	The Hungarian troops took over guard duties around the perimeter
of iiy carp dining the few days before the British arrived. I agree that during
this period more shooting took place than was customary when the Wehrmacht were
doing guards. I remember the incident on 15th. April 1945 in the late afternoon
when I went with a, British officerSto the potato patch and was ordered to remove
the dead body of a prisoner from that patch. I think it is wrong that this man
should have been shot and have no doubt at all that It was either the Wehrmacht
or the Hungarians who were responsible.
8.	The rifle rqnge which is visible at the North West comer of
ny Canp was used fairly regular by the Wehrmacht two or three days a week.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that, the said Deponent not understanding English this Affidavit
was translated in my presence to the said Deponent before swearing and I am
satisfied that its contents were fully understood by the said Deponent.
Dated this/ day of

STAmrEMT OF S.3. OBESSTDEMFUHHER FRANZ HESSLER: -
I want to tell you all I can and I am willing to assist your
investigations in any way.
I am 39 years of age and was bron at KEviEEN, AEGAU. I am a married man
with three children and by trade was a photographer. As 1 was out of work
•4'.
I joined the S.3. when the Nazi party came into power on 3.0th January 1933*
I volunteered-for this service. From 1933 'to 1935 I was in the S.3. oarracks at
DACHAU doing ordinary duties. In 1935 I took over as cook at the concssnfcration
camp at DACHAU and I held this position until 1941. ’whilst I was there up to
the end of 1935 the Commandant was a man named EICKE and from 1935 until 193o
* A
or 1939 this position was held by Oberfuhrer LORITZ. I cannot remember the
name of the Commandant after him.
In 1941 I went to AUSCHWITZ concentration camp where I established a
kitchen and I remained there until 194-2.
I then went to KtHZE-BROCHA in Poland building special huts for a
Hospital. I took a working party from AUSCHWITZ concentration camp of about
60 and I was in charge. We were there for about nine months and I then went
back to AUSCHWITZ. After being in charge of working parties there for a ^ile,
ifeft/S tht women's camp at BERKENAU near AUSCHWITZ, The conditions here
were very bad, the camp ms overcrowded and sanitation was also very bad. The
^	the charge of Obersturferer HOESS.
I asked to be moved from this camp because of the conditions. The job of hie
jaen was to build roads, more huts and make those huts already there habitable.
The 3.3. woman in charge was Oberaufserherin KAUDEL. Whilst I was there many
died from spotted fever (cerebal-spinal-menengitis) and typhus. Amongst
these were guards as well as inmates. I made many complaints to HOESS and as
a result beds were made but not enough to accomodate all the prisoners in the
can??. The women in this camp did agricultural work. Whilst I was there the
place/...﻿V-r

.-2-	.	M ~
place was inspected oy Obergruppenfuhrer GLUCKS from Berlin.,, He went throng
the camp by car and said that everything would be altered but nothing was done
At all camps the inspection was the job of the AMTSGPTTPfffifc D. 5 Berlin and
car • beAgiie
CLICKS was in charge of this department. A He took his orders direct from
Reichfuhrer HIMffiSS. The oanp at BBRKEKAU was also inspected by HBjMLER
whilst I was! there \^io said the same - that conditions would be altered -
but again nothing was done.





After about two or thi'ee months there^l wras moved to HBGKARSLZ near*
BADEN. This was a small camp for about 500 prisoners and the labour was
supplied from DACHAU concentration camp. I held the position of Koromaudofuhrer.
All the men under jiy command lived in a three-storey high school building but
there were others in a nearby camp. All were engaged on building an aeroplane
works in the mountains but it was never completed.	J -dkytr. $f>‘
! i
In June 1944 I went hack to AUSCHWITZ where I became a Lagerfuhrer and
I stayed there until it was being cleared in January 1945* This was because
the Russians were advancing, and the whole camp was cleared. ^^
y	1 then went to DoaA cacip at NOHDILiUSM where I remained until April 4
1945 and when that was also cleared I came to BERGEN-BEISEN.
I have no knowledge of sterilization of women and no orders were
given by me that this should be carried out. In fact I did not know that
this was being done and I was never allowed in the Hospital.
Everyone in the camp, knew about the gas chamber at AUSCHWITZ but at no
time did I take part in the selection of prisoners who were to go to the gas
chamber and then be cremated. Whilst I was there selection of prisoners for
the gas chamber was done by Dr. KLEIN, Dr. MENDELS and other young Doctors
whose names I do not know. I have attended these parades but my job was
merely to keep order. Often women were paraded naked in front of the
Doctors and persons selected by the Doctors were sent to the gas chamber.
I th i uk those selectedwere mostly those wiio were not in good health and
could not work. When transports of prisoners arrived the prisoners were
taken from the train and marched to the camp. On arrival they were paraded
front of the Doctors I have mentioned and persons were selected .Lor the

gas chamber the remainder being sent to the concentration camp. I have
also attended these parades but only when I have been Orderly Lagerfuhrer
as this was part of his duties. Trainloads of 2,000 to 3,000 arrived at
4
the camp and often as many as 800	went to the gas chamber. The
Doctors were always responsible for these selections.
Whilst I was at AUSCHWITZ the Goirnmndant until June 1944 was
arb he was succeeded by hOggS. I made many complaints to TI0ESS about the
way people were being sent to the gas chamber but I was told it was not my
business. The camp was inspected once a year by HHvlvILSS and also
Obergruppenfuhrer GLUCKS and Obergrj^penfulirer BDKL from Berlin.
t '.	* HL.j L2R knew people at AUSCHWITZ were gassed because it was he who
j	gave the orders that this would be done. These orders could only have come
from the top. HITLER must also have known that this was going on as he was
the head of the country.
At many of the camps and to my own knowledge at AUSCHWITZ brothels
were ruin according to instructions given by HBML8H, The girls for these
brothels were selected by Doctors at the camp. Dr. KLEIN and Dr. MSNGELE ,
„	/ -v l- ' ' have to ny knowledge made iiiese selection^; Men who were in working parties
^ ......
were paid token money which soratimes amounted to as much as ten marks a week.
With this money they were able to pay the girls one mark a time. Of this
money 10 pfennigs went to the woman in charge of the brothel and 90 pfennigs
to the girl herself.
’Whilst I was at DORA camp NOEDHAUSEH, I received complaints from the
prisoners that they were not receiving their Red Cross parcels. In view of
this I personally saw that the prisoners did get their Red Cross parcels.
The parcels had to be 'opened for censoring but I made sure that no articles
were removed.
The food at DORA camp LBEDHAUSSN was not good although the
prisoners received more food than at other camps because of the fact that
they were wotlcins. ®>ere wee hot enough fat in the food for the men to
uve on. The food wy have heeh enough for eight houra woik but was hot
enough for twelve. The fool had to be reduced on account of bombing.
t/﻿I complained about the shortage of food whilst I was there Qkersturmfuhrer 4^'
to Gomnandant BAER. Prior to BAER’s
*
arrival at the cairp the Goinmandant was a man named EIRSHfiSR. I also made a
complaint to Verwaltungsfuhrer B3SENM3IS who was at DORA camp representing
Obergruppenfuhrer POHL	As a result of this a field
Bakery was built in DORA camp0
When the English were advancing, DORA carap was closed and the prisoners
eventually came to BEEG-EN-BELGER. Actually they should have gone to nEUMGAMtviE
near HAMBURG- but whon the trains got there they were sent back to BSRGM-BELSM.
One trainload of these people, about 5,000 strong, never arrived at BELSEN so I
cannot say what happened to them. I went on in advance of the trains and
reported to Commandant KRAMER and enquired if the prisoners had arrived. He
said they had not and in any case he had no room in the camp for them. He
sent me to Oberst HARTES of the Wehrmacht, whcml saw and who told me that the
Wehrmacht were leaving the barracks and that I could take over part of the
barracks to house iry men. I did this and so the men under my charge did not
^p in	where there was so much typhus and disease. I was
Lagerfuhrer in charge of this small camp.
I met the transports from NOHDHAUSEK at BERGEN-BELSEH station. - At the
rear 4f ttefe train ^vas a Doctor and an Ambulance waggon in which the sick were
- oarciBd. About 20 to 25 tod'died on the w from cold, undemouniotoant and
beinglfea^ ^ These bodies 2re taken to BELSEH cWand buried there. I did
not go in the Ambulance waggon nor did I give w instructions that sick people
were to be shot. I did not see the prisoners leave the station as I went back
to the camp by car and the prisoners walked,
I did hear from prisoners in the oartp that peroral people in a transport
that walked from DGRh camp were shot. These prisoners were under the somand
of Hauptsoharfuhrer STSKSL (STcJiSL) and Untersoharfubrer *RR (BOH). I
mentioned these shootings to these s hut «aey both denied'all knowledge of
them and I newer had a chanoe to continue the conversation.
we were not allowed to shoot prisoners unless they tried to escape or
attacked the guards. Beatings were also not allowed. I have never seen ^

anybody shot or beaten whilst I have been in concentration camps although
I have seen people -gassed. /	^	<1*
I have never had occasion to shoot anyone, or beat anyone, nor was I
ever attacked. I have always tried to be kind to the prisoners and to help
them. I once made an application to leave the 3.S, because of vdiat was
happening in concentration camps but my request was refused. It was not nice
to be a Nazi nor was it a privilege. The S.S. \vere always watched by the
<kf	i4o£SS Jif
Gestapo and we were forbidden to talk of ibonditions in the camp to anyone.
I never even told ny wife. 1 only volunteered forth© 3.3. for four years
but in 1936 it was made compulsory for twelve years and it was impossible to
leave.
When the English were arriving near BKL8EN I was told by Oberst
i'Ko	s'
HABIES that 'the English would shoot all S.S. on eighty In spite of this
volunteered to stay behind with five others who were: - WlfflBIK I&ER,
PAUL PHITZGH, EUGEN HAHNEET, GEOHGE KRAFT and FRANZ S1\3FEL and in addition
two cooks whose names I do not know. The camp I was at was guarded by
Hungarians, ^camp % being guarded by the Wehnoacht^ Abbut twelve to fiiteen

\k


S.S. escaped from the camp and a lot also left from the other camp.
The food for prisoners at BEISEN was obtained from the Army food place
through Oberst HARIES. The prisoners should have got 300 grammes of bread
daily but sometimes they only got 200 or ICO grammes. In addition they got
potatoes, turnips, beetroot and some grease. Sick people got rice ana milk

if it could be obtained. There was not sufficient food for the people to
live on and the responsibility lies with the Writschaftsverwaltungsamt of
which FOHL was in charge. I do not think that it was the indention of the
countiy to starve these people but there was a general shortage owing to
bombing. I did not know myself that conditions were so bad in^camp -4
until I was sent there by the British to assist in burying the dead when it
was a great shock to me to see what had been happening.

STATHfflW OP ELISABETH VOUvEHRATH, S. 3. Oberaitfseherin.
I am 26 years of age and come from 3CH0HAU near BADLAtffiBGE, Silesia.
I am a married woman, my husband being in the 3.3,, and I have not heard of him
for a long time. Before being called up into the 3.S. I was a hairdresser. In
1939 I was. called up to work in a munitions factory and on 1st October 1941 was
transferred to the 3.3. I never actually became a member of the 3.3. We merely
wore the uniform end became supervisors at concentration camps.
On joining the 3.3. I was sent to Ravensbruck where I became an Aufseherin
and was taught how to treat prisoners. We were told that we were noc uO talk to
prisoners and our job was to take them to work and see onat they didn c escape. I
later went into the concentration camp at Ravensbruck where I worked under 3. s. woman
ImlTGESELD and Commandant KOEGEL. In March 1942 I was transferred to Auschwitz where
I remained until 18th January 1945. I then proceeded to Bergen-Belsen where I
arrived after a long train journey on 5th February 194-5.
On arrival at Auschwitz I was placed in charge of a working party sewing
clothes. I later was placed in charge of the parcels department where Red Cross
parcels and parcels from families were received far the prisoner^. I always made
it ray duty to see that the parcels were delivered and those prisoners that worked
under me can say that this is true. On 20th September 1944 I took over a working
can® in Auschwitz consisting of a cobblers shop and tailor1s shop which were run
for the benefit of the prisoners. I remained at this post until the can® was
cleared. Whilst I was at Auschwitz the Commandants of the can® were Commandant
HGESS, LIEBEHEKSCHEL and BAER. On the women* s side there were S.3. women

in possession of things they should not have and consisted of running round the
room, bending their knees and generally doing physical exercises. I have always
tried as far as possible not to forget that I was a woman and a human being. ^

DEPOSITION of No 14276652 C.S.M. JOHN DIDDLE, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, sworn before Major
SaviUe Geoffrey Champion R.A., Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation
Team.
1.	On 24th May 1945 in company with 13053505 Corporal W. SHOTT,
Pioneer Corps, 21st Army Group Interpreters Pool, I interviewed HEINRICH
SCHREIER at the office in Belsen Camp of No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
Through the interpreter; the said Corporal SHOTT, I asked him various
questions. The questions asked by me were written down by Corporal SHOTT
in German and the answers were written down by SCHREIER also in German, the
whole in my presence. These questions and answers were signed by SCHREIER
on each page in my presence, and are contained in five sheets and are now
produced and shewn to me and marked "J.L.1." Corporal SHOTT afterwards
translated these questions and answers into English and such translation
is contained in three sheets and is now produced and shewn to me and
marked "J.L.2."
2.	I had previously seen SCHREIER and asked him as to his
service and had asked him as to the nature of the uniform which he is
wearing in the photograph now produced and shewn to me and marked " J.L. 3» "•
At that time SCHREIER denied that the photograph shewed him in SS uniform
and said it was an infantry uniform that he had borrowed. The said
photograph for the purpose of identification was signed by SCHREIER and
myself.
3.	The said photograph was first seen by me when it was handed
to me by Captain ALFRED JAMES FOX, General List, D.A.P.M., O.C., 86
Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, and I was told by
him that the said photograph had been taken from the possession of SCHEIER.
SCHEIER in my presence at the said interview on the 24th May 1945 > and
previously, told me that the said photograph had been in his possession,
had been taken from him on his arrest, and was a photograph of himself
and a girl friend, the latter now being dead, having been killed in an
air raid.

Question:When did you join the German Armed Forces,have you done it voluntarily or
forcibly?
Answer: A conmission came to the "Umsiedlungs-lager" Wilhelmshoehe in October 1941
and we were mustered. I joined the Wehrmacht on October 1 oth 1941 and

Question:
Answer:
When was the photo taken? Why do you wear on it SS uniform? And to whom
did this SS uniform belong?
The photo was taken in Summer 1941 and belonged to the SSman Jansen, Karl.
We were together with two girls and we had exchanged the uniforms without
any definite reason .
Where was the SSman Jansen,Karl stationed ,where did he live and what
are hid particulars ?
I doH not know where his unit was stationed. He was a man from Linz ,
about 1.70 to 1.75meter hight, dark curly hair, dark eyes, with slightly
bent nose.Jansen was 20 years old,slim of stature,oval face, dark
compleiftion , white teeth and normal ears, no particular marks.
He was member of the Waffen SS but I do not know which particular Unit.
Was it a big crime in the Wehrmacht to wear the uniform of a unit to
which one did not belong?
We exchanged the uniform only for the moment the pictures were taken.
It is certainly not a crime because there were many who did it,even
Officers.
Why did you at first say the uniform is aninfantery uniform ?
At first I was afraid to say that I had put on a SSuniform because
then I was likely to be taken for a SSman. I acimit having been a fool.
Do you respect the SS ?
After what I have seen in Belsen Camp I can only hate but never respect
them.
Have you respected the SS before ?
Before I took the SS for soldiers and as german soldiers they were
neither to respect nor to hate.
Why do you wear at the moment a jacket of the Luftwaffe and fieldgrey
breeches and a fieldgrey cap ?
I came from Schwerin to Celle with a transport of wounded; whilst
loading and unloading-because I am a male nurse-my trousers were torn
and I took a pair of trousers from a wounded and I took a cap that was
better than my own.﻿>n

Question:
Answer:
cJt
Why are the sleeves of your jacket so short and why are they so
shabby and tom ?
Lately they were not very particular with uniforms. The main thing was
you got something to put on,whether too big or too small did not
matter.
Have you ever been in Auschwitz?
No.
Were you stationed during your service in the Luftwaffe ,with
detailed dates?
I joined in Kattowitz, Uppersilesia, on October 1o 19V where I
stayed til\ August 1942. Prom there I went to Rumania to various places
where I stayed only a short period , 5 to 6 days.My longest stay was
in Jassy.At the beginning of 1944 I came to Traumen see ,Norway.
In February 1945 to Neustrelitz. There we got the order to march
twenty km via Schwerin to new positions but 6 km from Schwerin
we met the Americans and we laid down our arms.
Why do you think do former prisoners of Belsen Camp identify you
as a SSman whom they have met in Auschwitz ?
That is a riddle to me, it must be a mistake.
You have like all other SSmen got your bloodgroup under your arm.
Why?
The bloodgroup was tattooed at the moment you acquired the u-erman
nationality,that means on the day we became G-erman citicens.Women ,
childern and men were tattooed.

"R.C.1"
This is the Statement in G-erman marked "R.C.1" now produced and
shown to ROBERT CQLiS referred to in his Affidavit ^swom this f tr
day of June 1945 Before me﻿About the middle of April, my Battalion was ordered to move
from NEUSTRELITZ to SCHWERIN* About 6 Km before SCHWERINmet troops
which I took to be Americans and handed over our arms. The Medical Personnel
amongst us were taken to a collecting point at SCHWERIN. We remained at
this place for some hours. , I saw nearby some houses painted with the
Red Cross. We left SCHWERIN, taking some wounded German soldiers and
went to CELLE in German lorries. The journey lasted four or five days.
On the way we left some wounded in different Hospitals, and collected
passes for the journey from American and English Military Police. In
CELLE we delivered the wounded to a Hopital, the name of which I do notn
remember. Prom there I was sent to BELSEN in thtbeginning of May together
with a group of 30 Doctors and 50 medical orderlies and 27 sisters.
I was working at BELSEN until the day of my arrest, about two weeks later.
Question: "Tell me exactly what you did in CELLE"
Answer:	" I went first to the Hospital and received from a Doctor there
a Chit who sent me to the SEKT-KAZSRNE There I reported first to the
Chief Doctor, later to a Sjt, who directed me to a room where I could stay
overnight. Some more Medical personnel arrived there in the evening
and we left at noon next day for BELSEN.	I believe there is still a
Sjt at BELSEN who was sitting next to me in the transport of Medical personnel
from CELLE to BELSEN who should remember me"

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
ATROCITIES AT BELSEN
DEPOSITION of HERTA EHLERT (Female) SS AUFSSHERIN, late of
Alexandraplatz, BERLIN, sworn befoe Lieutenant-Colonel LEOPOLD JOHN GENN,
Royal Artillery, Commanding, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 4-0 years of age.	I was occupied as a Bakery Saleswoman
until 15th November 194-0, when I was conscripted into the SS. I do not
regard myself as a member of the SS because Iwas not in sympathy with them
but I have worked as an AUFSEHERIN with the SS since that date. I would
be ashamed of belonging to the SS because so many things happened which
were terrible.
2.	I reported to RAVENSBRUK where I remained for two and a half
years as AUFSEHERIN. In Autumn 194-3 I was sent from RAVENSBRUK to LUBLIN.
I stayed there until Spring 1944 as AUFSEHERIN in the Laundry and I was
then sent to CRACOW Work Camp and Concentration Camp. In November 1944
• I went to RAISED which was a dependency of AUSCHWITZ. On the 15 th January
1945 I was sent to ORANIENBURG and thence to BELSEN early in February 1945.
At BELSSN I continued to be an AUFSEHERIN and ELIZABETH VOLKENRATH, who was
the Chief of the SS Women, made me her assistant.
3.	The conditions in BELSEN were a shame and a disgrace. I consider that
the people chiefly responsible were KRAMER the Commandant, DR HORSTMANN,
•‘^■''KLIPP who was for a time KRAMER’s Second in Command, and HAUPTSTURMFUHRER
VOGLER who worked in KRAMER’s office and was responsible for food supply.
I say that KRAMER was responsible for the conditions, among other reasons,
because on one occasion when I complained of the increasing death rate
to KRAMER he replied "Let them die, why should you care"
4.	I have no loiowledge of any shooting of inmates at BELSEN when I
was there except for one girl who was shot trying to escape from an outside
working party and a Nurse who was shot and killed from one of the guard
towers when a window was not blacked out quickly enough during an air raid
alarm. I do not know the names either of the victims or of those who did
the shooting.
„ 5.	I have often seen priso ers beaten at BELSEN. One of those
I have seen bea,ting prisoners is RAPPORTFUHRER^GOlLASCH. When GOjLASCH
beat people she did it very heavily and always with a weapon such as a
walking stick, piece of wood or anything she could find. She hit them
on the head, on the back, or on any part of the body. I do not know
whether prisoners died as a consequence of their being beaten but I have
often seen her continue until blood came from the victim’s mouth	and
nose. The victims were in such a weak state that they would be very lucky
to survive such beatings as I saw her give. GOtLASCH left BELSEN six
days before the English arrived and I believe that she went home
to visit her people at KOTBUS.

6.	I remember some time in February a Polish prisoner called K0P0R0VA
was being beaten by four of her fellow internees for having betrayed them
when GOtLASCH came into the room and continued to beat her with a stick
to such an extent that I tried to make her stop. The victim was at least
partly clothed but I think she lost some of her clothing in the course of
the beating.
7.	I have never seen anybody else beat prisoners in BELSEN. I myself
have struck them only with my hand, never with a weapon.
8.	I have been told by many of the prisoners that after the Hungarians
took over guarding the Camp, which was about a week before the arrival of
the British, four nights in succession they had shot at prisoners from the﻿Watch Towers giving as an excuse that the prisoners were trying to escape.
9.	I remember an occasion at BEL3EN some time in February or March
when an escaped prisoner^ either a Polish or a German woman,was caught after
trying to escape. KRAMER, the Commandant, questioned the girl in front
several of us S3 Women and I saw him kicking and shaking her and later
hit her with a stick on her head and fane and all over her body quite
unmercifully. As. a result of this she gave the names of two girls who$L
she said had helped her to escape. KRAMER sent for these two girls
and instructed KASAUfTTZKY to give each of them five strokes •on t he haye^ ^
behind to make them confess. I saw KASAIjtfCTZKY carry this<*outjJranaea3h
of the girls was then made to stand in a comer while. KASAUfETZKY took
one of them into another room to interrogate her. I was present
throughout these proceedings with GCfiLASCH and VOLKENRATH but left when
the first girl was being interrogated and do not know what subsequently
happened.
10.	Although! have not witnessed any beatings of prisoners by
other S3 I have heard that ILSE FORSTER and FREDA WALTER used to beat
internees to a quite unreasonable extent. One young ROTTENFUHRER whose
name I do not remember but who was at BELSEW for three or four days told
me on one occasion that he was on his way to complain to UNTERSCHARFUHRER
MULLER that he could not continue to work in the Cookhouse while the
brutality of the beatings given by ILSE FORSTER and FREDA WALTER was allowed
to continue. I also found ILSE FORSTER myself, when visiting the Cookhouse,
with a very red face and in an excited state, which she told me was due
to her exertions in beating prisoners.
11.	I have also heard that IRENE HASCHKE and HERTA BOTHE have often
beaten prisoners and that GERTRUD SAUER and GERTRUD FIEST had the reputation
of being very severe. From my own knowledge of JOHANNA BORMANN and from
working with her I believe that the stories about her brutality to
prisoners are true although I have not myself witnessed it. I have often
seen the dog which she had and heard she used to let it loose on prisoners.
Although I have not seen it I can well believe it to be true.
1 2.	I should like to add that HILDA LISEVITZ and ELIZABETH FRITZNER
to the best of my knowledge and belief were always well behaved and treated
prisoners really decently.
1I believe that some of the prisoners are blaming us for things
that were done by the AUFSETERIN who preceded us at BELSEN. For instance,
I remember that S3 WOMAN SPORN, who left BELSEN about 20th February 1945
XjvA because she was pregnantCaccording to what VOLKENRATH told me, as a result
ifo3 of a love affair with KRAMER^ has, on occasions, punished numbers of
prisoners by making them kneel with bricks or stones on their heads and
their hands held above their heads for as long as three hours at a time.
_r\0 I can speak of this of my own knowledge since _I saw it happen.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AT BELSEN AND AUSCHWITZ
DEPOSITION of IRMA GRESE (Female) SS KOMMANDOFUHRERIN at
Auschwitz and Belsen, late of WRECHSN, near FELDBERG, sworn before
Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Germ, Royal Artillery, Commanding
No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
-).	I have said in a previous Statement that I have never
beaten or ill treated prisoners. I have thought it over and I now
wish to confess that I have done so and to tell the truth.
2.	My duties at Belsen included talcing "Appel" or roll-call
twice a week. My rank was KOMMANDOFUHRERIN. I was employed as
AUFSEHERIN. In this capacity it was my duty to supervise tidiness and
general cleanliness in the Camp. My duties were in the Womens’ Camp
only. I never struck prisoners during the weeks I was at BELSEN.
— *-	■ ■—■--------------—le prisoners on the face
Though I never struck
prisoners in BKLSEN and I never saw anyone else do so, I remember seeing
RAPPORTFUHRERIN DRESCHEL strike prisoners at AUSCHWITZ. She did this
with her hand. I only saw it from a distance but they were struck only
on the head. I myself did not strike prisoners often but quite
frequently when they did something I didn't like.
4.	On the whole I consider that I treated prisoners well.
I did not think that any of them were hostile to me when I was working
in the Can?). I now find that they all appear to be hostile to me.
I think that is because they are hostile to all SS because they cannot
forget the number of people among them who were gassed at AUSCHWITZ.
I myself think they are perfectly right to feel hostile towards us.
5,	I have been shown Photograph B.U. 37k6 showing a woman,
with bad scars on her face which I believe to have been caused by beating
with a stick. I have never seen such a thing happen at BELSEN but I
have definitely seen UNTERSCHARFUHRER TAUBE beat people in this way at
AUSCHWITZ. He did it with a stick.
6.	I have again reflected and I wish to add that I have
in fact beaten prisoners other than with my hand as already described.
This was at AUSCHWITZ when for at least a week several of us SS Women
had short whips made in the Can?) Workshops with one of which I several
times struck prisoners before these whips were taken away from us as
I also now admit that I punished prisoners by making them
kneel on the ground for periods of a quarter of an hour at a time. I
did not at the same time make them hold their hands above their heads but
I saw this being done when I have made my report to another part of the
Can?) at AUSCHWITZ. I do not know the names of the people in AUSCHWITZ
responsible for inflicting this punishment.
8.	•	I remember saying in the first statement I made to an
English Officer that "Himmler is responsible for all that has happened,
but I suppose I have as much guilt as all the others above me" I meant
by this that simply by being in the SS and seeing the crimes committed on
orders from those in authority and doing nothing to protest or stop than
being committed makes anybody in the SS as guilty as anybody else. . The
crimes I refer to are the gassing of persons at AUSCHWITZ and the killing
of thousands at BELSEN by starvation and untended disease. I consider the
crime to be murder.
-1-﻿%	i know about the G-as Chamber at AUSCHWITZ becuase prisoners
who worked in it told us about it. I only saw it myself from a distance
but I have no doubt that many were gassed there.
10.	I recognise a number of people on photographs I have been
shown of S3 Guards 'who were at BELSEN. No 3 on Photograph 1 was a Clerk
at AUSCHWITZ. I do not know his duties at BELSEN. No A on Photograph 3
was an Electrician at BELSEN and AUSCHWITZ. No 1 on Photograph 5 was a
Cook at AUSCHWITZ and in the Pood Store at BELSEN. No 2 on Photograph
5 worked with No 4 on Photograph 3 as an Electrician both at AUSCHWITZ
and BELSEN. No 4 on Photograph 7 was a cook at BELSEN. No 5 on
Photograph 9 is Doctor KLEIN.	No 3 on Photograph 9 was a waiter in the
Officers Mess at BELSEN. No 1 on Photograph 9 was only at BELSEN a few
days. He came from MITTELBAU. I do not know how he was employed.
Nos 1 and 3 on Photograph 12 were employed at both AUSCHWITZ and BELSEN
in the Guardroom checking prisoners in and out. On Photograph 22 No 6
was in charge of all SS Women Guards. No 5 was No 6's Second in Command.
No 3 was a Telephonist. No 1 was in charge of the Bread Store. On
Photograph 19 No 6 was in the Kitchen for a little while. No 5 an*3- No 4
were AUFSEHERIN, No 3 looked after the Pigs, No 2 was a Telephonist. On
Photograph 25 No 5 was in charge of the wood cutting and chopping. No 4
supervised outside working parties. On Photograph 35 No 1 was a Telephonist,
No" 2 was sick while I was there, No 3 worked in the Kitchen. On Photograph
37 No 2 was in the Kitchen, No 3 was also in the Kitchen.
11.	X never saw any of the beforementioned SS ill treating
prisoners in any way. I have now confessed to all tne ill treatment of
prisoners of which I was guilty because it has been on my conscience.
I have nothing else to admit.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
DEPOSITION of HILDEGARDE LOHBAUER, German Internee
working as ARBEITSDIENST at AUSCHWITZ and BELSEN, formerly of
FLA 'EM IN VOIGTLAND, SAXONIA, sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel
Leopold John Genn, Royal Artillery, Commanding, No 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team.
1.	I am a German National, unmarried, with two children. I
was put into Concentration Camp for refusing to work in an ammunition
factory. I went to RAVENSBRUK from 1940 to 1941.	I was then
transferred to AUSCHWITZ where I stayed until approximately January
1945. I returned to RAVENSBRUK until March 1945 when I came to
BELSEN. At first I was an ordinary prisoner but for the past two
years my job has been ARBEITSDIENST, whose duty it is to produce
the number of people demanded by the Camp Authorities for working
parties.
2.	Treatment of prisoners in BELSEN was severe, but not as
bad as it was in AUSCHWITZ and RAVENSBRUK. I have only once seen
a prisoner shot. This was on the day the English liberated BELSEN
Camp. When the Amplifying Unit first came to the Camp to announce
the"arrival of the English many of the prisoners rushed forward
X C JU MJ-Lllg,*	lllOJ VVCAC OWJ-Ui. oiicto	v	v	- — *
Dutchman, who persisted, was shot from behind by RAPPORTPUHRER EMMERICH.
I saw that the man was dead and he was carried away. The S3 Women
at BELSEN did not carry arms but all at AUSCHWITZ carried pistols.
The SS Men were armed and I believe that shootings took place-at
BELSEN and AUSCHWITZ on outside working parties though I myself was
never a witness.
3.	Beatings of prisoners were frequent both at AUSCHWITZ and
BELSEN. At AUSCHWITZ regular organised beatings were given. I
myself was given 15 strokes on the behind for smoking at AUSCHWITZ
in 1943. The punishment was carried out by two fellow prisoners, one
of whom held me on a punishment block while the other beat me with a
solid wooden stick. I believe that such organised beating was
prohibited afterwards at AUSCHWITZ because of injuries caused to victims.
I know of none at BELSEN.
A.	As ARBEITSDTENEBT I have myself frequently hit prisoners
to keep order but only Tilth my hand.
5.	Of the SS Men and Women whom I have seen with my own eyes
beating and ill treating prisoners I consider that GERTRUD FIEST,
GERTRUD SAUER, HERTA BOTHE and PETER WIENGARTNER should be punished.

AT BEISEN the 13 th. June 1945, KARILY BELA LUKAGS is examined by the under-
signed Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, R.A., Legal Staff, No.l War Crimea
Investigation Team.
CHARGED. "You are charged with illegal possession of property of Czech
Nationals, that is to say, the shop in Svalava of Zoltan Gdttoann, and the
stock thereof, and the stock of Piriweisse, Josef Birribaum, Moric Mayer,
and M.Guttinann (Father of the said Zoltan Guttmann) You are further
charged with perjury resulting in the deaths of two Czech Nationals,Rosenstein
and a Baker (name unknown) age 30 to 35* the father of 6 children, both
residents of Svalava. You are said to have falsely accused these two men
of a burglary at your shop and they are said to have died whilst being
interrogated by the Police. Do you understand of what you are accused?'*
Answer
"Yes"
Caution "You are not bound to say anything. If you wish to make a
statement, you may do so, and it will be written down and may be used
in evidence. Do you understand"
Reply	"Yes - I desire to make a statement"
Statement contained in Sheets 2 and 3
-2-
"I lived at Keosheuret, Arpad K5rut 8, Hungary. I was a textile merchant.
I am a Hungarian. I went to Svalava, Czechoslovakia in April 1941 - I
made a mistake it was 1942. I was hot in Svalava in 1940. I had
business relations with Zoltan Guttmann who had a shop in Horthy-Nikolas
Strasse, Svalava.	He traded under the name of "Slovanka". I got the
shop of Guttmann.	The Hungarian State lent me n»ney to buy it. There was
no stock. I do not know why the shop was taken away from Guttmann — the
Hungarian State took away permission for Guttmann to trade. He was a Jew.
I did not pay Guttmann anything for the shop. I paid for all thxtiles
that I had had from Guttmann. Guttmann was not accused of selling goods at
sin excessive price. Guttmann was in a Forced Work Camp for 3 months in
1942. All the Jews were taken. After 3 months, Guttmann returned to
Svalava. I got material from Birhbaum. I paid a great lot of money.
It was above the official price. I had some material from Piriweisse
and returned it to him. It was no good. I had goods from Mayer and paid
for them. I had none from Guttmanfcs Father. In 1943 I had two
burglaries at ny shop. I did not know who did it. It was at night.
I did not accuse any particular persons. I know the police interrogated
many, but none died or were punished.
-3-
I have never heard of Rosenstein, nor of a Baker with six children.
I joined the Hungarian Army on 29th. August 1944. I am a private in the
5th. Hungarian Signal Division, 2nd.Company, now are stationed at Bel sen
Camp. Before the British arrived I had never been to the Concentration
Camp No 1"
On this being read over the following corrections and additions
are made by the accused:-
"	"I had no relations with Zoltan Guttmann until sifter I had
taken over the shop. After Hungary took Svalava Guttmann renamed his
shop "Record". The money lent by the Hungarian State was not to buy
the shop but to buy-ay stock. The shop was taken from Guttmann because he
was a Jew and this was the policy of the Hungarian Government, The Jews
were taken for forced labour according to their age group - it was
similar to being called up for the Army. Before I was called up for the
Amy I had heart trouble. I do not desire to sign this statement as I
cannot read English. If one of ny officers were acting as interpreter I
would sign it."﻿¥
#
Taken at Belsen this 13th. June 1945, and translated to the
accused. I certify that the accused's statement is as made by him,
according to the interpreter, in my presence.

Protocol
The undersigned member of the Hungarian Army LUKACS, Karoly born at
KSCSEMET on 20. 4. 1910, Merchant of KECSKEMET,. HUNGARIA
The above named states
I enlisted on 28 Aug 44 at SZEG-EDIN and ms to be trained as
Signalman. On the 8 Oct 44, believing the -war to be over, I went home in
civilian clothes. I was called up again on the 14 Oct 44 at KECSKEMET
and rejoined on 19 Oct 44 resp 22 Oct but got uniform as late as the
second half of November. I was then transferred to PECS for the Signal Corps.
As the Russians approached our Company Conmander Captain FALUSI, Dezso
brought us to BELSEN in January 45 from which time I stayed here and had
to guard horses and carts.
I learned as a dealer in textiles in PEST, ZALAEGERSZBG and
KECSKEMET, and in 1938 obtained a licence as a Textiles Merchant for Markets
and Fairs. I was suspected of hiding Jewish money, which caused difficulties
and in 1942 I returned my licence, but got from state resources a gratuity-
of 8000 PENG-0. When I saw in the newspapers that able Aryan merchants
were wanted in order to take charge of Jewish businesses, I entered for
it. I was sent to SVALAV, CARPATHIAN RUSSIA, in April 42. In SVALAV,
by order of the District Consul Itook over the goods of the following
merchants BIRNBAUM, Josef, GUTMAN, Zoltan, and FRIEDMAN, Marton (the
name of the firm was 1EISZ PIRl) which consisted of ready made articles of
clothing and shoes. I cannot remember how much I paid for this merchandise
but I paid according to the bills of the delivering firms. I sold these
goods in a short time and bopcfit new goods mainly from PEST.
I stayed in SVALAV for seventeen months and thenretumed to
KECSKEMET. My wife needed mountain air for health reasons as she was very
weak. Later she longed for KECSKEMET, and so we returned there. During
my stay at SVALAV burglars broke' twice into my shop, 61 Main Street, but it was
not possible to find the culprits.
I further state that I suffer from Heart Disease. This was
the reason that I could not do military service before. In my youth
I drank too much, gambled, and my parents therefore did not want to have
anything to do with me. I have a wife and small child, whom I believe to
be in BUDAPEST.
When I left SVALAV I had, so far as I remember, 20,000 PENG-0
and opened a shop for ready made articles of clothing at KECSKEMET.
I am now working in Block MB 48
I further state that on the occasion of the second burglary
I was suspected by the Gendarmes of having done this myself.

I desire to make a statement.
It was sometimes necessary to heat people to keep order - tnis was ao
Laurahutte and Hanover. I arrived in Belsen on 8th Aprix. On 13tnjiprx~
I hecarae prisoner'block leader, and on 20th April I became ill mth _■ n:
tyohus. I never beat anybody at Belsen. I . as not at • .•'telsen in ..^.rch.
No"" one has ever bled as result of my heatings. I. never used a stick.
or rubber truncheon or anything else. I only used my hands. I cai.de mi
the same transport- to Belsen as Ladislaus JUDE04ETZ and Arnos o BaSCh.
I both of them at this office a few days ago.
I never said:" 50people died to-day, unless order is kept I mil see
100 die tomorrow", or anv words to the same effect. In lact, I never was
on a parade at Belsen. I remember the Dutch boy being beaten at Hanover.
■ I did not beat. him. It was done by the Camp Leader (prisoner) Otuo 0STEEL0
and Block Leader (prisoner) JACOBI.
Description of Otto 0STEEL0: German aryan. Age about po. ..eight 1.mm.
Bald mth very thin" brown hair at sides. Tledium build. Clean shaven.
I last saw him at Belsen before the English came.	.
Description of JACOBI: German Aryan. Age about'35. Height^l.T^mtr. Hair
dark broim. Very slim. Clean shaven. Comes from DRESDEN. I last saw him
at Belsen before the English came.	oa
I saw the beating by JACOBI of the Dutch boy, who was abouu_20 years o_
a-e. Jacobi used a stick. I had been told Osterlo had already beaten him.
.	-	He was beaten for stealing food - he often stole food. He was taxer „o
the bath-room. In the morning, owing to his injuries, he coula no longer
walk. I went and saw him in the hospital and on orders of Jacobi, who -..as
sev,iov to me, I received from the Blockleader of the Hospital on one
occasion, and from a hospital orderly on two occasions the^Dutch boy s
bread ration. This was to replace bread stolen by tne boy. .. .
two bread issues - one- in the morning and one in the evening..I took
only the raomirig ration. I took no other food from the boy. Bread was
short in the Camp. I spoke to the boy. I did not say: Lou scouncr
did you want to eat? You are going to die and 1 shall give youx a a
to somebody else." I told the boy I had corne to take the breaa. he had
stolen. I do not know whether the Dutch hoy recovered.	^
This hoy often stole and was heaten. I have myself seen a ^-jr ,s ^
strokes administered from time to time. I can not say whetli.fr a ^ was
necessary. I did not do it. I tried to help him, and have given nim
some food additional to his rations.	.
I have never been brutal. I was not callous. I did wnat ’	.	. D

is e:^mined hy the
0 R B E S,’ R.A., Legal
QUESTIONED: I am Helena KOEPER, bom 24 February 191o at PLOCKI, Hungary.
I was 10 years at Prague University of Music, then went to live
in CRACOW after my marriage, either my husband nor I are Jewish.
My husband was an officer in the Polish Army,, and is now living
with my two sons in Cracow. I was arrested in Cracow in June 1940
because the Gestapo suspected me of anti- German.sympathies and
found me in possession of an- anti-German pamphlet. I was in prison
for four months in solitary confinement, at the Gestapo Prison
in Cracow; then I was sent to Ravensbruck Camp in October 1940.
Then to Auschwitz-Birkenau in October 1941, thence to Belsen-Bergen
in December 1944. I held no official position at Birkenau, where I
worked all the time in a penal kommando. At Bergen I was for two and
a half months Block§Tteste, and. for a fortnight with the camp police.
CHARGED:	You are charged, whilst at BIRKENAU and BELSEN, as follows:
1.	) acting as a SS spy.
2.	) making false statements to the camp authorities to the prejudice
of your co-prisoners, that is to say, reporting at BELSEN that
prisoners were in possession of jewelry.
3.	) making reports to the camp authorities as to prisoners in posses-
sion of valuables etc., resulting in such prisoners being deprived
of their property and being beaten by the SS.
4.	) demanding and accepting bribes to favour certain of the prisoners.
5.	} retaining for yourself an unfair share of available food.
6.	) beating prisoners with various weapons and injuring them.
7.	) murder, as a result of beating, and in particular murder of a
Polish Jewess, aged about 30 years, housed in the sick block at
Belsen, by beating with a leather strap until the woman fell to
the ground unconscious and suffering from concussion, and who died
three or four days thereafter as a result of this treatment.
Do you understand of what you are accused ?
ANStVER:	Yes.
CONTINUED:You are not bound to say anything, but if you wish to say anything
y u may make a statement and it will be written down and may be used
in evidence.
REPLY BY I desire to make a statement.
ACCUSED:
STATEMENT I never was a spy for the SS and cannot understand why anyone should
accuse me of that. F.CI AIT S 7 I 5 T A h was_ not in the SS: he was
a Pole in the WEKRMACHP, and I had known him in Cracow before the war.
BY
ACCUSED
It is untrue that I ever reported to the SS that any of the prisoners
were in possession of jeweliy. During tne searches ±or jewelry only my
own bed and room were searched, because the other Blockalteste reported
to the Can Commandant that I was in possession of jewelry. I was searched
as a result and my ring and necklace taken and I was beaten by
Ober-Assistent A S S L A N H. !y arm and nose were broken with a stick,
and then I was nut into solitary confinement for 20 days. The occasion
on which the other Blockalteste beat me had nothing to do with jewelry
or valuables: it was because they said I had drawn 120 rations more
than my block was entitled to draw. I never made any reports about
jewelry or valuables to SS woman m HE....
I never accepted, bribes from prisoners to induce me.to favour, them.
My kommando was nearly all Hungarians, and had nothing with which to
bribe me. I never excused anyone1 from "Appell" in return for food:
I already feot more food than the other prisoners because I had friends
in the kitchen, and also ROMAN SVISTAL brought me plenty of food. _﻿-2-
Statement of HKLEKA K.Oi-PKirc
Some Blockalteste used to take the rations into their own rooms, but
I never did: instead, I used to divide them up evenly in front of the
other prisoners, I do not remember the incident about KOPFL, but if
she returned from the hospital late in the evening, she should have
khewh dram her rations at the hospital, I did not keep back extra
food; and as I got butter from ROMAH SYISTAL I had no need of margarine.
So far from keeping back food from the prisoners, I used to give them
food from my. own supplies.
I admit freely that I slapped prisoners on the face, but this was only
bacause it ms necessary to preserve discipline. I used to feel sorry
for striking them, especially the elderly people, but I used to become
nervous, because if my list at roll-call was not correct, I would be
compelled to do two hours' "sport" in the office or elsewhere and. I was
afraid of it. I never used a-stick, strap or whip: sometimes I
threatened prisoners with*my leather belt, which was only about an
inch wide, but I never actually struck them with it. I have only
slapped prisoners, and never kicked them: I would have remembered
if KOEPL had been- in my kommando because her name is so like my own.
The only time I have made anyone kneel was once on parade, when I
made my friend JANIHA KRAJEWSKA. aged 25, kneel for 5 minutes for
talking and moving while the camp commandant ms on1 parade.
It is quite untrue that I beat or killed the Polish woman who was sick .
in my block."

Helena KOPPER and signed by her in my presence.

I was chosen as second assistant to my blockleader, a4rf" so had to do what
the SS told me. But I did not do more than I could help, and was several
times myself -eaten by the SS. I never took any Apells: it was not my job..
The SS used to beat me, and I never got anjf rewards from them. The only
time I received any cigarettes was one occasion when all prisoners Y/ere
given, three each. I had nothing to do with the distribution of any food:
the soup Yra.s shared out by the first assistant, and bread by the block-
leader hi> iself.
I did not hold Apells specially to prevent prisoners from sleeping during
the night: some of the prisoners were on night shifts and had to be woken
at special times. I did not make any one squat.
It is true that I sotfietimes beat prisoners, but I only used ray hands, never
a stick or a ladle. I had to do this in order to make them do their vrork.
If I had not done so, the SS would have beaten me.
I have never beaten anybody with a soup ladle or a piece of iron, and not
kill the Frenchman or any of the other prisoners.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
DEPOSITION OP FRIEDRICH MATHES (male) sworn before Major SAVILE GEOPBHEI
CHAMPION, Rqyal Artillery, Legal Staff, No.l War Grimes Investigation Team.
1.	I was bom on IJth. June 1893« I sun married and ny wife is still
living at Offenbach. Before the war I was a painter and vamisher.
2.	On 26th. July 1944 I was conscripted into the German Army as a full-
time soldier and being too old for the ordinary type of regiment was sent to
the Landes Schutzen, Frankfurt am Main. I was in barracks in Bonames, which
is a suburb of Frankfurt. After 8 weeks training I was sent to Oranienburg
and in October 1944 came to Belsen*
3.	In February 1945 we had SS pay bocks and SS uniforms issued in lieu
of Wehrmacht. I do not know why this was done as my duties did not change.
auJ&ull/h
At Belsen I was in the delousing centrai, I did no other duties. I could
not even do sentry duties because I have a rupture. During February 1945
thirty S.S. men were sent from Belsen to join Field Troops and about 20 - 25
S.S. men came from Auschwitz as replacements. Shortly before the English
came 5 or 6 S.s/<»j!»,were transferred, to Hamburg and were replaced by others.
There were altogether about 110 SS men at Belsen, including 50 conscripted
into the SS of which I was one* The SS men who left Belsen just before the
English came ran away. They were not ordered to go. They ran away because
they knew that they were criminals.
2^*	When I first wait to Belsen there were about 15 SS women but later
on, when the new transports arrived, about another 15 SS women came to the
Canp. I know of no SS women who escaped just before the English came but
one or two may have done so*
5.	I cannot say much about the Concentration Camp at Belsen because
I have never been inside* I was always in the delousing centre and although
this was at the entrance to the Camp I could not enter the Canp itself because
I had to have a pass to do so. I cannot say how many prisoners were in the
Camp* Only technicians entered the Camp if there was work required to be done.
Even the guards were outside the Caup* I do not know whether the Camp was
Pull or not.	I did not speak with the SS to ask them. The SS always kept
away from us.	Although we were SS we did not have the same privileges as they
-1-﻿did. If we stood near they moved away from us.
6.	Sturmbaiaifuhrer HAAS was the Commandant of Belsen Camp when I
first arrived. Description:- Age about 55 years, height 6ft., very broad,
• + " '
bald on top, black hair at Sides, very dark complexion, oval face and clean
shaven. Commandant KRAMER came to Belsen 8 to; 14 days before Christmas 1944*
There was an Unt erscharfuhrer FRIEDRICH who was in the political department
at Belsen. Description:- Age 45 to 48 years, height 6ft., slim build,
completely bald head. I have never heard of Unterscharfuhrer POTT.
I think that WIIMSCHEN would know him because he, WILMSCHEH, was in Belsen
for four years and consequently should be in a position to know everyone.
I know of a Hauptscharfuhrer BALZ. Description:- > aged about 42 years,
height 5* 8", medium build, dark hair, either clean shaven or has a very small
close cut moustache. Speaks with a Saxon accent. FRIEDRICH and BALZ
left Belsen before the English came. I have heard nothing about a British
Marine being murdered at Belsen. I think that the Commandant is responsible
for any shootings that occurred. I do not know which of the SB men carried
out his orders.
7.	For the first 6 weeks after ny arrival at Belsen I worked as
Kitchen Chief in the SS kitchen which was outside the Camp, next to the barrier
where the SS barracks were. Prisoners used to come to ny kitchen to draw: the
food. I did not return to the kitchen shortly before the English came.
ottfflTPVR and I worked in the delousing room right up to the time the English
arrived* WILMSCHEN, MEDCHER, and men from the kitchen should be able to
state that I was not in the kitchen. If people say that I was there as
kitchen chief just before the English arrived they are telling untruths.
8.	I recognise No.2 on Photograph 2/4/2 as a supervisor of the women
at AUSCHWITZ. I do not know her name. She was only at Belsen for about
4 weeks. I recognise myself as No.3 on Photograph 3 •
X did not know that anything was wrong within Belsen Camp,I knew
about the epidemics but that was all. After the English arrived we had to
shift the dead and I was surprised to find the Camp so bad. I had never
been aware of any stench arising from the dead bodies which were in the
Concentration Camp at Belsen. Those responsible for the deaths of the
26,000 by neglect and starvation etc. are the Camp Commandant and mainly
the medical men. The Doctors at the Camp were, SCHNABEL, HORSTMANN and
KLEIN.
10.	I am a German. I knew that there were Czechs, Poles and other
nationals in the Camp. I cannot say about their food. I have only dealt
-2-﻿•with the food of those who worked with me. I did not know of the deaths
as a result of starvation until I was told by you. It was not right that
these people should have been starved. I realise that the German nation as
a whole is responsible. Those in command and those in higher places should
be executed. I was never a member of the Nazi Parly. I was against them.
We older men were put in the SS against our will. I deny that I have ever
shot anybody. If anyone says that I did, they are telling untruths.
I did my best for the prisoners who worked for me in the delousing centre and
have even stolen food from the kitchen for them.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that, the said Deponent not understanding English, this
Affidavit was translated in my presence to the said Deponent before swearing
and I am satisfied that its contents were fully understood by the said
Deponent.
I HEREBY CERTIFY that I have accurately translated this Affidavit to the

DEPOSITION on oath of Alois GOTZY, male, of PRESSBURG, Czechoslovakia,
sworn before Captain Myles LERNER, Royal Artillery, of No 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team, at ESTER\7SG-SN on the 24-th January, 1946.
J- ,	,	My name is Alois SOTZT. I was born at :Pressbura,
Oseohosl.ovalma, on the 17th Deoember, 1923. My nationality is Sseoh.
MS.,3SSmL#OT“' 1 '~a t0 ^ at	near
2.	I was conscripted On the 20th February, 1943 > &n<3. joined
the Totenkopf Sturmbann of the Waffen S3. After having completed two
months' training at Mauthausen I did sentry duties there. My rank in the
S3 at the time was Schutze. On the 1st February, 1945j I was promoted to
the rank of Oberschutzen. At the beginning of May, 1943j I was transferred
to Lins, v/hich was a subsidiary Camp of the Concentration Camp Mauthausen.
I did guard duties there. During the d.ay I went outside with a Labour •
Commando and supervised the work. At night I did guard duties on the tower.
In October, 1943» I came to Buchenwald$ to be trained as an S3 driver.
After Li days I was given a driving licence and transferred to Mittelwerk.
I was an ambulan.ce driver there and did the same job at Mittelbau.
where I arrivfed in the Spring of 1944. In April, 1945, Mittelbau was
evacuated and I was sent to Belsen. I arrived at Belsen on the 12th April,
spent the night there at the Panzer School, drove to Neuengaraiae on the 13th,
and returned to Belsen on the 14th April. On the 15th I was taken prisoner
by the British at the Panza*School.
3.	I never beat prisoners and never had an opportunity of
doing so as a driver. I never did any guards at Belsen. This can be
confirmed by Dr. Kurzke, with whom I was together continuously from the
time of the evacuation from Middelbau until my arrest. Dr. Kurzke knew
me at Middelbau since the Summer of 1944 and also knew that I was only an
ambulance driver. My instructions at Mauthausen were contained in the
order issued by the Reichsfuhrer, and were read out to me always at the
commencement of rry duties. It was a normal instruction to the guards.
4.	The majority of the prisoners at Mauthausen and Linz were
Czechs, Poles and Russians. I never saw at these Gamps that prisoners
were beaten.
5.	At Middelbau I saw that prisoners were beaten by the foremen,
capjjos and S3 Block Leaders. I saw this when I drove the lorry to the
hospital, I do not know the names of the >33 Block Leaders since I only
knew people from the Driving Section and the Revier closely. Since I was
the only S>3 man named G-otzy in the as# aforementioned Canps there can be
no question of mistaken identity.

Pressburg, Czechoslovakei. Ich bin von Czechischer Nationalitat,
meine Muttersprache, ist Deutsch. Ich wohnte Elostergasse 6
Oberufer b/ Pressburg, Sfowakei.
A|} 20. 2. 1943 wurde ich eingezogen und kam. zur Waffen SS in den
T^tenkopf Sturmbann. Nach 2 Mcnaten Ausbildung in Mauthausen be-
gann ich mit Y^achdienst in Mauthausen. Mein Rank in der SS war
damals Schutze, erst am 1. 2. 1945 wurde ich zum Obersehutzen
befbrdert. Anfang Mai 1943 kam ich nach Linz, w© ein Aussenlager
des Konzentrationslagers Mauthausen war. Ich tat dort Wachdienst.
A^ Tage ging ich mit einer Arbeitsgruppe,aof Aussenkommando und
beaufsichtigte die Arbeit. Bei Nacht stand ich Wache auf dem
Turm. Im Oktober 1943 ham ich nach Buchenwald zur Ausbildung als
SS Kraftfahrer. Nach 14 Tagen bekam ich einen Puhrerschein und
wurde dann nach WlittelltiS^versetzt. Ich war dort Sanitatskraft-
fahrer und tat dasselbe auch in MittelwSek, wohin ich im Fruhjahr
1944 kam. Im April 1945 wurde Mittelbau evakuiert und ich wurde
nach Belsen geschickt. Ich kam am 12. April in Belsen an, uber-
nachtete dort in der Panzerschuie, fuhr am 13. nach Neuengaam®

den Englandern in der Panzerschuie gefangen genommen.
Ich habe nie Haftlinge geschlagen und habe als Kraftfahrer auch
nie Gelegenheit dazu gehabt. Ich habe in Belsen nie Wachdienst
gemacht. Das kann von Dr. Kurzke bezeugt werden, mit dem ich
von der Evakuierung aus Mittelbau bis zur Gefangennahme standig

8.	Mji duties as Capo were as follows. I had to see that the prisoners
carried out their duties correctly. I had to dish out the food during the
lunch time interval and I had to return the Commando to the Camp complete
in the evening.
9.	The guards for the Commando supplied by the Camp consisted of an SS
Unterfuhrer and two sentries. One of the sentries had a dog. The dogs were
to be used in case of an attempted escape. I never saw that dogs were chased
after the people of my Commando.
10.. The working hours in the Camp were from 7 a.m. until 12 a.m., then there
was an interval from 12 until 1300 hours and work recommenced at 1300 hours
until 1700 hours.
11.	I had to accept the post of Capo at AUSHpT/ITZ by order of the
Arbeitsdginstfuhrers SS-Sturmann P0RSCHEL, who told me that if I refused I
would be sent to the punishment block.
12.	I had no reason at AUSCHWUPZ to complain about the people in my Labour
Commando. They were very decent-only sometimes during the dishing out of food
they became unruly; I had to box/ their ears. I only hit them in the face with
the open hand. In the mornings too during the Appel which took place at
0530 hours I had to box them some times or box their ears if they did not
want to line up. I was beaten nyself by the Kommandofuhrer because I helptd﻿-2-
the people and because I had told him he should not beat them so much, since
they would work better if they were not hit so much. The Kommandofuhrer
often beat the prisoners with a wooden truncheon because they did not work
well enough. I myself beat the prisoners if I saw that they did not work
but I did so only if the Kommandofuhrer got excited and I was therefore
forced to intervene. Nobody ever bled after I had beaten her nor has anyone
been injured in ary other wa^» I always hit in the face only and never kicked.
13.	I feceived a direct order from the Arbeitsdienstfuhrer to beat prisoners
on the working site. Subsequently the prisoners complained to their,
blockleader that they had been beaten by me; this complaint was justified.
In other words I beat the prisoners because I had been ordered to do so.
14.	Nobody who was ever'"beaten by m# has been injured. If I really
had to beat prisoners they used to come to me in the evenings- and tell me
that it had not been as bad as if the Kbmmandofuhrer had beat them. If they
were beaten by the Kommandofuhrer they showed green and blue marks on their
bodies. Nobody was ever beaten so intensively that he or she had to be
taken to the Revier.
15.	I knew that Gas Chambers existed at AUSCHWITZ and I was also aware that
a special track was laid from the station Auschwitz to the Gas Chambers and
that several thousand Hungarian Jews were transported there.
16.	None of the people of ny Commando were ever sent to the Gas Chambers.
I have never been present when the selections for the Gas Chambers took
place. I have never reported anyone for punishment or suggested that he or she
should be sent to the Gas Chamber.
17.	On 18th. January 1945 I came to the Concentration Camp BEISEN were I
remained until the British troops took over in April 1945. In BSLSEN I was
only an ordinary prisoner and had no special position. I cut wooa on the
wood cutting square. I had no prisoners under me there.
18.	I was a Capo only at AUSHCWITZ and not in RAVENSBRUCK or BELSEN. In
none of these three Camps was there a Cape - or a Supervisor with the same
name as mine.

sworn before Frank Peter CAOLA, Major RA of No. 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team at FALLINGBOSTEL on this
^ day of January 1946.
1.	Ich bin am 1.8.1910 zu Berlin geboren, ledig, reichs-
deutscher Nationalitat. Meine Heimatanschrift ist HAMBURG-
ALTONA, Hochstr. 18/19 c/o POPPEL. Ich war niemals ein
Mitglied der N.S.D.A.P.
2.	Vom Januar bis zum Juni 1959 war ioh als Dienstmadchen
in einer pension in HAMBURG angestellt.
5. Im Juni 1939 wurde ich wegen Arbeitsverweigerung in-
haftiert und dem Gerichtsgefangnis FUHLSB'GTTEL uberstellt.
Ich verblieb daselbst bis zum August 1939 und kam von dort
zum Polizeigefangnis HAMBURG. Im Oktober 1939 wurde ich vsa
dem Polizeigefangnis BERLIN-ALEXANDERPLATZ ubergefahrt, xto
ich ca. eine Woche verblieb.
4.	Am 2.November 1939 kam ich in das Konzentrationslager
RAVENSBRCCK woselbst ich fiir die nachsten 18 Monate verblieb.
In diesem Lager war ich die ganze Zeit liber in d-er Schneide-
rei beschaftigt, mit Ausnahme von 6 Monaten, die ich im Straf-
block des Lagers zubrachte. Meiner Bestrafung lag zugrunde,
dass ich von einem polnischen Mitgefangenen ein Stlick Brot
angenommen hatte.
5.	Am 28. Marz 1942 wurde ich in das Konzentrationslager
AUSCHWITZ iibergefdhrt, wo ich bis zum Januar 1945 verblieb.
Ich war hier die ersten 9 Monate in einem Kommando, das mit
Abbrucharbeiten beschaftigt war, eingesetzt. Auf Anordnung
des Arbeitsdienstflihrers wurde ich dann zum Kapo eines Arbeits-
kommandos, das in der Landwirtschaft arbeiteue, ernannt.
6.	Mein erstes Arbeitskommando , das ich flir etwa 9 Monate
hatte, bestand aus 100 polnischen und russischen weiblichen
Gefangenen. Es befanden sich keine Gefangenen anderer Natio-
nalitat darunter.
7.	Das nachste Arbeitskommando bestand aus 100 polnischen
Judinnen. und war gleich dem ersten mit landwirtschaftlichen^
Arbeiten beschaftigt. Dieses Kommando behielt ich bis zu mei-
nem Fortgang von AUSCHWITZ inne.
8.	Meine pflichten als Kapo waren die folgenden : ich musste
daflir sorgen, dass die Gefangenen die ihnen aufgetragenen Ar-
beiten korrekt verrichteten, ich musstd in der Mittagspause
das Essen austeilen und hatte am Abend das Kommando im Lager
vollzahlig einzuliefern.
9.	Die vom Lager gestellte Bewachung fur das Kommando be-
stand aus einem SS-Unterflihrer und 2 posten, von denen die
letzteren je einen Hund mit sich fiihrten. Die Hunde hatten
den Zweck Fluchtversuche zu verhindern. Ich sah nie, dass
die Hunde hinter Leuten meines Kommandos hinterherge'schickt
wurden.
10.	Die Arbeitszeiten im Lager waren von 0700 Uhr bis 1200
Uhr, dann eine Mittagspause von 1200 bis 1300 Uhr und wiederum
Arbeitszeit von 1300 bis'1700 Uhr.
11.	Ich habe den Posten eines Xa£0	au;£ Befehl
des Arbeitsdienstfjiihrers SS-Uaterb-oLarx1 uhr-e-r PORSGHEL uber-
nehmen mlissen, der mir sagte, dass wenn ich es nicht tate ich
in den Strafblock kommen wlirde.﻿Summary of Examination of Wally Frieda Gertrud KIERSCHKE
Page 2.
Ich konnte mich in AUSCHWITZ nicht liber die leute meines
Afloeitskommandos beschweren, sie waren sehr anstandig. Ich habe
nur manchmal bei der Essenausgabe, wenn sie zu wild warden ihnen
eine Oiirfeige geben mlissen. Ich schlug sie dabei lediglich mit
der flachen Hand ins Gesicht. Auch des Morgens, wenn gegen 0530
Uhr der Apell stattfand, musste ich sie manchmal stossen Oder
ihnen Ohrfeigen geben, da sie nicht antreten wollten. Ich erhielt
selbst vom Kommandofuhrer Schlage, weil ich den leuten beistand
und ihm sagte er solle die leute nicht soviel schlagen, sie war-
den ohne Schlage besser arbeiten. Der Kommandofuhrer schlug die
Gefangenen haufig mit einem Holzkniippel, weil sie nicht gut genug
arbeiteten. Ich erhielt ebenfalls deswegen Schlage weil nicht
ordentlich gearbeitet wurde. Ich schlug die Gefangenen auch, wenn
ich sah, dass sie nicht arbeiteten, tat dies aber nur wenn der
Kommandofuhrer sich aufregte und ich deshalb gezwungen war dazwi-
schen zu gehen. Es hat niemals jemand geblutet nachdem ich geschla-
gen hatte Oder sonstige Verletzungen davongetragen. Ich schlug
stets nur in das Gesicht und habe niemals getreten.
13.	Ich erhielt den direkten Befehl vom Arbeitsdienstfiihrer die
Gefangenen auf der Arbeitsstelle zu schlagen. Die Gefangenen be-
schwerten sich daraufhin bei ihren Blockaltesten, dass'sie von
mir ge^chlagen worden seien. Diese Beschwerde war berechtigt. Mit
anderen Worten ich schlug die Gefangenen, weil ich den Befehl
dazu erhielt.
14.	Niemand der von mir geschlagen worden ist war je verletzt.
Wenn ich wirklich einmal zuschlug kamen die Gefangenen des abends
zu mir und sagten es sei nicht so schlimm gewesen, als wenn der
Kommandofuhrer sie geschlagen hatte. Wenn sie vom Koramandofiihrer
geschlagen wurden hatten sie grline und blaue Stellen am Korpef.
Es wurde aber niemals jemadd so geschlagenqj dass er in das laza-
rett musste.
15.	Ich wusste, dass in AUSCHWITZ die Gaskammern existierten
und ich weiss auch, dass ein extra Bahngleis vom Bahnhof AUSCHWITZ
zu den Gaskammern gelegt wurde und dass mehrere Tausend von unga-
rischen Juden dorthin transportiert wurden.
16.	Es kamen niemals leute von meinem Kommando zu den Gaskammern.
Ich war niemals anwesend wenn die Auswahl hierflir getroffen wurde.
Ich habe niemals jemanden zur Bestrafung gemeldet Oder gar zur
Uberlieferung zu den Gaskammern vorgeschlagen.
17.	Am 18. Januar 1945 kam ich in das Konzentrationslager BE1SEU,
wo ich bis zur Ubernahme durch die engliechen Truppen im April 1945
verblieb. Ich war in BELSEN nur einfache Gefangene und hatte dort
keinen speziellen Posten. Ich hackte Holz auf dem Holzplatz. Es
unterstanden mir dort keine Gefangenen.
18.	Ich war nur in AUSCHWITZ Kapo und nicht in RAVEHSBRUCK oder
BELSEU. Es gab keine andere Aufseherin oder Kapo meines Uamens in
diesen drei lagern.

ERFURT, Germany. I was a factory woman at ERFURT. I was
arrested in 1939 because I refused to work in an ammunition

You are charged with the following offences at AUSCHWITZ:

prisoners.	.
2.	Ill-treating your fellow-prisoners by unfairly
punishing them.
3.	Beating your fellow-prisoners.

I desire to make a statement.
I was brought to Auschwitz in 1942 and had to work very hard
like the other prisoners until 1944 when I was made a Capo.
I did not want to be a Capo but one is forced to accept the
—------ appointment. I had no dealings with the SS because I was
working on the erecting of Air-raid Shelters at gun sites
for Flak and this came under the direction of German soldiers
who gave the orders. I was found in possession of cigarettes
and I lost the job.
I once received 50 strokes with a stick for not driving the
prisoners sufficiently. I did not Mat anyone in Auschwitz
but on the contrary I was beaten myself often. I have some-
times slapped a face when I had to deal with about 140 women
at a time" and could not help it. I never used a stick.
A proof of this is that there were many Russians m my Kommando
and if I had been cruelto them they would have soon finished me.
There are many girls who know me and. will speak for me but
many Hungarians have left.

You are now going to be charged. You will not say anything

March and April, 1945. Do you understand?
Yes.
You may give evidence on oath or make a statement not upon
oath. If you make a statement on oath you will be liable
to be cross-examined. If you make a statement not upon
oath you will not be cross-examined. You are not bound
to say anything, but if you wish to do so it will be written
down and may be used in evidence. Do you understand?
Yes.
Do you wish to give evidence on oath or to make a statement
not on oath or not to make any statement at all?
I wish to make a statement not on oath.
The information which I have just given in reply to
questions is true. I was during the months of February,
March and April in Block 213 and not in the kitchen block.
What was the number of the kitchen block?
199. I was transferred from Block 213 to Block 199 for
four to five weeks. I helped distribute the food and
kept order outside the kitchen window. Whilst doing
so I used to hit people with a belt but not seriously.
I was the "Stubenaelteste" - the person responsible for
the room. I used to look after the sick. I used to
/cook ......﻿- 3 -
A. 21. cook for them and do their laundry and treated than well. I had
(cont'd)
to see to it that the girls who worked in the kitchen until
midnight were accommodated on return from the cookhouse.
I never hit anybody during this time. I have nothing else to say.
I am number 30 on photograph 2/5/4» I am told that it is alleged
that I beat people at night for crying and moaning and that among
the people so beaten was a Polish girl named IDA FRYIMAN who was
beaten on the night of the Jlst March, 1945, and who died the next
day. I wish to say in reply to this: I do not recognize the
nqmft of this girl* I never beat anybody who died the next day.
I am prepared to swear this. The people who did the beating at
night were two guards inside the building. They were prisoners
and known as night guards. I am further told that it is alleged
that a Polish girl named HOFFMAN used to work in the cookhouse,
and that one day she was suffering from diarrhoea; that when the
prisoners were lined up for food HOFFMAN wanted to go to the
lavatory, and that she asked me for permission, and I am alleged to
have beaten her with a wooden stick. It is further alleged that
she excreted there and then and fell down unconscious. I wish to
say in reply to this: I never beat anybody to the extent that-she
would have died. I desire J^i^LJhe ^following witness in ny
defence:-

You are not compelled to make any statement, but may do so if you wish;
it will be written down, and may be used in evidence.
I desire to make a statement.
I admit that I have slapped my fellow prisoners now
and then, but I only used my hand and hit their faces, and used no more
force than was necessary to keep them in order. For instance, one night
I found one woman had no blankets, while another had four, and when I
tried to take one from the latter she would not let me have it until I
slapped her. It is quite untrue that I ever beat anyone with a stick, or
with anything other than my hands. I have never beaten any children, on
the contrary, I have always tried to see that they got extra shares of
sweet things.	1
I used to slap my fellow prisoners rather than report
them, for this would have got them at least into the punishment-kommando, a
much more severe punishment.
I was also beaten myself by S3 woman GRESE and Ober-
Scharfuhrer Weingartner, among others, for doing things for the benexit
of my fellow-prisoners. Once I tried to make a wood fire to heat some
water for the sick ones in my block; this was forbidden, and I was caught
and punished. Again, I was myself in the punishment-kommando for 5 weeks
at Auschvitz, just before coming to Belsen, because I let womenwho had no
shoes go off Apell and so escape a working party.
I have never thrown heavy boots at anyone. It is
quite untrue that I have ever kept my fellow-prisoners unnecessarily on
Apell, or punished them by making them kneel. I have always worked for
their benefit, and have been punished for things I have done for them
more often than I have myself slapped them.
I desire the following to be called as witnesses,
in my behalf: Sania and her sister, Guta and Andzia, CI2Y, DILI, ELA and
SZARY, DORKA, HILDA, DORKA and SZARY. Marja Lejbowicz, JHLISCHKA and
Irene, of whom I last heard in Belsen.

i

TAKEN at Belsen this 6th day of July, 1945, "by the undersigned Captain
Alexander Mackinlay FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team*
Questioned
My name is MENDEL GRUNSPAN. I have also been known by
the nickname MANEK. I am a Polish Jew, born in Cracow on 3 March 1904.
Unmarried. I was first a bank clerk, and later worked for a paper shop.
I was arrested as a Jew at Cracow in August 1942 and sent to RZESZOW
labour campj there I helped to make an air raid shelter and then became a
labour leader in the factory attached to the can?). I left RZESZCW in
July 1944, and after several days each in different camps and seven weeks at
URBIS I reabAed WATTENSTADT Camp (15 km from Braunschweig) in Oct 1944.
I was sent to Ravensbruck in April 1945 and two weeks later to WERBELIN,
where I was liberated by the Americans. I came to Belsen about 21 Jun to
look for my cousin.
Charged
You are charged with the following offences at RZESZOW
and BRAUNSCHWEIG:
.	beating your fellow prisoners
2.	ill-treating your fellow-prisoners
giving information to the SS to the detriment of
your fellow prisoners.
taking for your own use clothing intended for your
fellow prisoners.
# Do you understand the charges made against you?
Reply	Yes
Cautioned You are not compelled to say anything, but may make a statement if you
wish; it will be written down, and may be used in evidence.
Reply
Statement
Accused
I desire to make a statement
I admit that I sometimes used to beat fellow prisoners,
but this was only to make them finish their work. I never beat anyone so
that he became unconscious or suffered serious injury. On a few occasions
I did lose a rubber truncheon, but never beat anyone without his clothes on.
I only made men work overtime if they had failed to
finish their work. Sometimes the factory manager made us all go back
for a special job, but this only took about a quarter of an hour. I only
used to keep back the men who were behind with their work.
It is quite untrue that I have ever called Apells
throughout the night, so that my shift could not sleep, or that I made
them do "sport" as a punishment.
I have never reported anyone for failing to share his
food-parcels with the other prisoners. I remember the three brothers
who were taken away by the police for this, but I had nothing to do with
them, they were not in my hut, and I did not report them to the police.
I never reported anyone to the police for being
idle or failing to finish their work. Instead, I would give them a light
beating, or keep than overtime, but I very seldom had to keep than.
* The only clothes I got from the clothing store were
those I needed for my own use. I never exchanged any with Germans for
food or any tiling else.
*	i never beat anyone more than was necessary, and sometimes
beat them in front of the police so that the police would not punish them.
I used to work for the good of my fellowsprisoners.
When we were told a number of us were to be taken away - as we thought, to
be shot - I managed to have the numbers reduced by going to the German
factory authorities and persuading them that we needed these people in the
factory.

On this occasion I struck one or two internees with my open hand. It is
possible that the man who alleges that I committed atrocities was one of the
internees whom I struck and that he has denounced me for reasons of revenge.
I am not, and never have been, a member of the S.S. or a
Capo, and have never committed any atrocities at Sachsenhausen or elsewhere.

Are these pictures of civilians?
It was a reprisal because one officer and five men were killed
by partisans in that village. The whole village was therefore
surrounded and burned down.
Who told you that?
Unit took part.
You said just now that your unit had never taken part in any
massacres]
Not against the Jews. But eight small tanks from my Unit were sent
to this village with infantry.
Did you, yourself, take part in this^ with your Unit?
No: I was with the trucks and supplied them with ammunition. I,
myself, saw the dead bodies only after the deed had been done.
You said that you had only heard about massacres and seen nothing
of them.'
I thought the question concerned Jewish massacres.
To which Unit did you belong at the time of tills massacre?
The Tank Battalion of the Second Cavalry Regiment (2 Lovasdand ar
Herckocsi Zaszloaly), in: Szoreg, Topola and Szentamas in
Bacska - in April, 1941.
Is it true that the Arrow Cross is an anti-semitic organization,
and its policy the extermination of the Jews?
Yes - most probably, judging from their actions.
Why did you retain these two Swastikas?
I got them in Czechoslovakia when I exchanged souvenirs with a
schoolmaster there.
Do you approve of the SzAlasi policy of the extermination of Jews?
I got five days’ detention once when I went with a Jewish girl.
In your diary you criticize in one passage men who go with Jewish
girls.'
Sometimes a man does not know what he is writing in his diary.
Where was your unit in January, 1942?
After Christmas, 1941, I left my old unit and joined a new one in
Esztergora.
Were you there in April, 1942?
Yes, I was in Esztergom.
If you were at Esztergon in April, 1942, why did you write on this
photograph (marked f'.n.) "Zenta, April, 1942
My unit was at Esztergom, but I was on leave at Zenta in April, 1942?
What was your unit in January, 1942?
I was in the same Unit which I mentioned previously. My Unit was
removed to Bacska.
/Q. 42........﻿- 4 -
Q. 42. Why did you say you were only on leave there at that time? First
you say you changed your Unit and then you say you did not change
your Unit.'
A. 42. My Unit was in Bacska, Zenta, until the 3rd January, 1942. I was a
member of the crew of one of three tanks sent to 2,sablya.
Q. 43. What happened when you got there?
A. 43. We had orders to capture the insurgent Chetniks. The infantry
hunted for them and we went afterwards. The infantry only did the
massacring: there was no need for the tanks. I was at the
villages of Zsablya and Titel nine days. Afterwards I went on a
training course.

CAUTIOEED, You are not compelled to say anything, but you may make a statement if
you wishj, it will be taken down in wilting and may be used in evidence.
Do you wish to make a statement ?
SEELY
STATEMENT, It is not true that I struck anybody so that they would die of the clow.
Y/e worked one week from 6 in the morning until 6 o'clock at night and
the nest week from 6 o'clock in the evening until 6 o'clock in the
morning. One day v.hen we were working until 9 o'clock an Mr Said attack
occurred and when the olam sounded we went into an underground passage*
There were some Russians in the tunnel who struck people from my camp and
in addition they took everying from the Jewish prisoners which tney nad,
for example;hats and cigarettes, YfACHTEL was struck by the Russians*
When, we returned from the tunnel I noticed that WASHTEL liad gone mad*
t	Trim KrYnp. rmestions which he was unable to answer and lie said
shoes.﻿I went to the Blockleader and I was told by him to help, beca.use some of
the people were talcing food away before it could be distributed properly
and quickly.
The next day we began to divide the food and 5 icen were watching*
One man came from another block, I do not know his naroe - the same person"'
struck me with a knife. This man was given soup by one of the distributers
and because soup had been given to people who did not belong to the
block 5 people went without food; the Blockleader and the other leaders
gave their ration to these people. The next day the Blockleader told
me that if anyohe else came from another block we were to throw them out.
The secretary divided the food and 4 men were standing by so that no. one
could take any of it away. The same person came the nextday again and
asked for dinner and I told him that if everyone had had their ration
he would get some but he would have to wait until the end and he refused
to believe ms. I also told him that some of the people had been in
Belsen for three aionths and that he had only arrived two days ago,
therefore lie must realise that he could not get two meals. He then left me
and went to another place and I saw him do this. I told him again that
he must wait until eveiyone had had their meal. We then began to quarrel
and I repeated once more that he had had his meal . He endeavoured to
force his way in and I found a piece of wood and struck him. After this
the man began to. scream and the secretary came and asked what had
happened. X told him and the secretary said that I was right and if he
came another time the secretary himself would strike the man. 1 did	i
not see this man again.
Cn 21st. April 1945 I left Belsen for CeUe; some people had
told me that I could get better outre for the sick at Celle,so I went there.
Whilst there I caught typhus and I was brought into the hospital at Belsen.
I had an operation* On 6th. June 1945 I began to walk.
I net the man, who I had previously struck with a piece of wood,
in Belsen Cacp and he struck me with a knife. This was on 15th* June 1945.

HEHY
Yes.
About the man I have killed and the people I have beaten.
I would like to know the name of ihe person whom I have killed
as I do not know anything about having •killed anyone.
I have beaten people, I agree* but only bedause it was necessary
to keep the block clean when people refused to do it. For instance
I saw a prisoner come in with difty boots and he was going to bed
in ivig boots. I asked him to take his boots off and I said " The
block must be kept clean and you must take off your boots**. He
tefused to do this so I had to beat him.
Tslhen the people made the block dirty by refusing to go to Hie
lavatory I was woken up to restore order in the Block. The
prisoners themselves asked me to restore order and I was afraid
seme SS Blodkleaders would come and see it so I had to punish people
like that . On another occasion one of the prisoners stole
bread from another prisoner and I was asked to punish him because
was responsible for order in the block. I was always asked oy the
Blockleader to keep order and I was responsible for such order
to the Blockleader and to -the S3, guards.	/
I, have never beaten people because I am a sadist or because I
likedj^but because I had to do it.
I would like you to help me and to let me free.

^UBSTIOI'iBD. ■ My- naa^ is MARI MALZYHER. I am 22 years of age and a Polish
Jewess. 15y home twon' i^PilTOYf, Poland. I was arrested in 1943 with
Aryan papers and placed in OSTR0WEC Concentration Gamp. I wasthen transferred
to Auschwitz and came to Belsen on 1st. January 1945. I was in
34 and 216. I was a Hut Orderly.
I was in Block Nos.
CHARGEE). - - You are charged with the following offences at Belsen:-
(i) Murder of several fellow prisoners at Belsen between January
1945 and April 1945 including one RLORIl REICH by beating
them
(ii) Beating and kicking several prisoners during the same months.
Do you understand the charges ?
REPLY
Yes.
CAUTIONED. You need not say anything but if you do want to make a statement
I will write it down, get younto sign it, and it may be used in
evidence at your trial.
Do you wish to make a statement ?
ABS1ER
Yes.
STATEMENT. When I got to Block No.2l6 there were up to 1,000 prisoners there.
The Block was very small and people were also in the passage. It
was during the winter and there were only a few Polish Jews and
all the others were Hungarians and we had a Block Leader who was an
Aryan. She said that there were only a few Poles and that she
would have a Hut Orderly from the Poles and the remainder would
be Hungarians. There were five hut orderlies, 1 Pole and 4 Hungarians.
As we had so many people in the block and the SS Aufseherin used
to come to the block I had to keep it clean. The Block Leader
was punished when the place was not clean and she used to call
the hut orderlies together and tell them that the placd must be
kept clean and the people must keep themsilves clean. If they
did not do that eveiyone would be beaten and that happened quite
often. As it was the winter months and the people were not dressed
properly I could not chase them out and the Block Leader got hold
of me and beat me because I was responsible for it. I told the
people daily to go out and have a wash but they were very dirty and
there was plenty of lice about, typhus, dysentery etc.
They condider that I was bad because I made them wash. I
have never beaten anybody.
We received food in the block and as the people ware very
hungiy everybody rushed for the food and if _ I had not been
strict some would have had all the food and others none. I told
them to sit down and the food would be distributed properly and
when the people crowded arond and rushed for the food I had to
beat them to keep order.
How is it that no Pole has accused me of	All
those who have accused me are Hungarians. Everybody there used to
shout ‘Polish swines*
I was not cruel I only did my best for them. There was very
little water and I chased the people out to keep them clean.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIlvES
A N D
ATROCITIES AT BELSEN
DEPOSITION OP PAUL STEINMETZ, SS, Electrician,at Belsen, late of Neu Uln, Bavaria,
ST/orn before Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Germ, Royal Artillery, Legal otaff,
No.l War Crimes Investigation Team,
I am 51 ypams of age, married vrith four children, and was
conscripted into the SS on 15th. January 1943. I had previously been a member of
the N,S.D.A.P. from 1933 onwards and a Blockleiter from 1939 onwards. I served
in the 1914-1918 War, reaching- the rank of Feldwebel, and served for 7 years in the
Foreign Legion fr6m 1921 to 1928. I .protested as an old soldier against
conscription into the SS but was told as a soldier I must obey my orders. The
grounds of my objection had no connection with the work I might have to undertake
in the SS but were .'founded on difficulties connected with my past political
record.
I was sent for twenty days to Oraniehburg near Berlin and then
to Auschwitz Concentration Camp in February 1943, where I remained until January
1945 in charge of electrical fittings and repairs in Auschwitz, Comp 2, which
was known as Birkenau. My chief was Oberscharfuhrer BOHM, who was in charge of
the electricians in all camps. ^
Because of the nature of ny duties, I came only spadmodically
into contact with the ordinary SS guards and prisoners. I learned, however, during
ny stay at Auschwitz of the existence of a Gas Chamber. This infomation was
mainly derived from Hauptscharfuhrer MOLL,who was in charge of the Sonderkoirmando
mainly consisting of Lithuanians who did work connected vdth the G-as Chamber.
MOLL told me among other things that gas was put in from tin containers iiirough
Hrna-n windows, and that he had finished off nearly a million victims by August 194;;.
^	In regard to general treatment at Auschwitz, I saw and heard of
many beatings. In ‘particular vdth ny own e^es I saw Hauptsturmfu^er HOFFMAN
beat prisoners senseless on several occasions. The same applies to Hauptscharfuhrerj
PALITCH.
5>	x cane to Belaen in early Bebmary 19k5 aW found that the treat-
ment of the prisoners there was worse than it had been at Auschwitz.	.
j have been shown the photographs of many of the SS guards in
Belsen and I recognise the following: -as having beaten prisoners at Various
-1-﻿times in ny presence:-

Eos. 1 and 2 on Photograph 9.	FRMZ HE3SLSR, THEODOHS HEUSKSL

Eos. 5 and 6 on Photograph 22. HERULA EHLERT, ELISABE5H VOLKES/i-OIE.
In addition I have witnessed heatings by Unterscharfuhrer RiHJ
and Rapportfuhrer EldviERICH .
7.	I also recognise on the aforesaid photographs the following
people I believe never to hate taken part in any brutalities against or
beatings of prisoners
Ho. 4 on Photograph 9. who was employed in the S3 kitchen. ROBERT KURT
Eos.2- & 5 on Photograph 5-	WALTER: OTTO and H/dS HEINRICH
No. 2 on Photograph 3»	ANTON MASSCH
8.	I recognise No. 6 on Photograph 24, KURT RASCHAGK, as having been
in charge of the Clothing Store and having refused me proper clothing for
iry prisoner workers.
9.	i consider that the conditions allowed to prevail at Belsen amounted
to worse than murder. In ray opinion the principal people who are guilty,
apart from the ’high ups* in Berlin, and elsewhere, were KRAMER and Doctor
HORSTMANN because neither of them cared at all about the well-being of the
prisoners or did anything to try and improve their conditions, so that
thousands died of Typhus and for other reasons. The serious overcrowding
began in February 1945, at least, and KRAMER, in my opinion, should have
stopped further transports arriving with more prisoners. I asked KRiliER on
one occasion for clothing and huts for ray prison workers and he replied that
it was none of ray business. Dr. HORSTMANN made the some sort of remark to
me when I suggested tojiira that the prisoners should be given
ijher-l-ftg
-4s^s-be^e- -tfee E jaglish-eame-^ during which peried-
sal power vdiidh drove tlie pumps.Jiad.
laatH'i cuL uff.
10.	Three further people whom I consider guilty as contributing to uhe
Belsen conditions were Oberaufseherin YOLKENRATH and her assistant EHLERT,
both of whom neglected their duty seriously and spent the day going out with
their boy friends instead of looking after the conditions in which the
prisoners were living, and IRMA GEESE, who I know from what I saw myself
-2-﻿a"
to have been guilty of beating very many prisoners at Auschwitz and whom I
believe to have continued her conduct while at Belsen.
11*	I" have been told that there are allegations against me of beating
women prisoners. I deny this absolutely and say that I never on any occasion
lifted ny hand against any prisoner, and that any of those who worked under me.
one or two of whom are in the hospital in which I am now living, will say, if
asked, that I always treated them well and considerately*

TAKEIN AT CELLE this 7th day of September 1945, before the undersigned
Captain Alexander Mackinlay POHBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1.War
Crimes Investigation Team.
Questioned.	liy name is JOSSP CHUE5Z. I am a Polish Catholic, born in Belwitz,
Germany, on 8th January 1921. I was a farm-waggon driver. I was arrested
by the Gestapo in Nechen on 24th May 1941, for helping two Polish civilians to
escape from Germany.	After two months in prison at Bautzen, I was sent to
Buchenwald, from there I was sent to Dora-Nordhausen on 9th January 1944. I
reached Belsen on 27th March 1944 and was sent to Neuengatune on 10th October 1944|
I arrived back at Belaen on 12th April 1945.
Between August and October 1944 I was block-leader in No.2.block at
Belsen H0.1. Camp.
Charged. You are charged with the following offences at Belsen.
(1)	Murder.
(2)	Selecting fellow prisoners for petrol injections.
A	Do you understand the charges?
Answer.
A#
Cautioned.
Reply.
Statement
of
Accused.
Yes.
You are not compelled to say anything in answer to these charges, but may make
a statement if you wish to do so. If you do, it will be written down, and may
be used in evidence.
I desire to make a statement.
It is not true because I have only been a blockleader from August 1944 to
October 1944. I admit having beaten prisoners when the food was dished out,
but I have never beaten anyone to death. It was necessary sometimes to beat
prisoners because they came two or three times for food. I have never put any
sick prisoners outside, or made them stand outside the hut; I have arranged
for them to be transferred to the hospital.
I have never selected anybody for petrol injections, because this was done by
a Doctor Wiesner, and the prisoners who acted as medical orderlies; Doctor
Wiesner is the man responsible for these orders. On the morning roll-call,
the 33 guards used to leave the prisoners standing on the square, ana Doctor
ITesner^Z his helpers used to take the numbers of the prisoners and take them
to the hospital isolation room for injections. They also used bo bring
prisoners who were ill in bed, and these also were sent away for petrol
infections On narade they gave prisoners the order Open order inarch , and
took the numbers of prisoners who were suffering from T.B. , this was done in a
brutalrfinner, Ad the helpere often used to beat the prteonere. the
block leaders had nothing to do with these selections.
If anyone received a food parcel and the helpers got to know about jb, they
would so to the prisoner and ask him to give half the parcel. ^If he refused
he^as taken to the hospital isolation room for infection, and tne whole parcel
then went to the helper.
].y number was taken several times for injections, and I had to hide in the huts,|
otherwise I would have been taken to the isolation room myself.
I would like Stanislav MIKWA (Polish) to be called in riy defence

TAKEN AT CELLS this 7th day of September 194-5 fey the undersigned Captain
Alexander Lackinlay FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, Ho.1.War Crimes
Investigation Team.
Ivjy name is WILLI THXJRfiANN. I am a German Aryan and was born on 51st July
1922 at Greifswald. ly civilian employment was farmworker. Iwas arrested
on 21st January 1941 in Greifswald for sexual offences, and sentenced to
18 months imprisonment ’which I served at STIHM, aprison for young offenders.
Then I was sent to Ravensbruck Concentration Camp, which I reached in July
1945. I went from there to Belsen in February 1945* Part of my time at
Bad-Saaron I worked in a kitchen peeling potatoes.
You are charged with the following offence at Bad Saarons-
Beating your fellow prisoners.
Do you understand this charge?
Yes.
You are not compelled to say anytiring in answer to this charge, but may do so
if you wish. If you do make a statement, it will be written down and may be
used in evidence.
I desire to make a statement.
I admit having struck my fellow prisoners, but only because it was necessary,
and I never hurt any of them seriously. There were piles of rotten
vegetables kept in swill-bins outside the kitchen, and the kitchen	^
S3, man, told us that to prevent disease in the canp we must stop our fellow
prisoners from taking these vegetables, using force if necessary. It was
for this purpose only that I used to strike my fellow prisoners, using
broom. I cannot give the names of ary .witnesses for my defence.

"tf-AKEN AT CELLE this 10th dayof September 1945, before the undersigned
Captain Alexander Mackinlay EOrfflES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War
Criries Investigation Team.
B	Ivy- name is KACZY3KA, Stanislaus. I was born in WISMAR, Mecklenburg, c
25 May 1914. My parents were Polish Aryans, and I acquired German nationality
in 1925 when my mother was re-married to a German national. My civilian
employment was as lorry-driver±s mate. In 1935, I voluntarily enlisted in the
German Anry. After three months in the infantry, I was transferred to an
"unreliable" section, as my origin and politics were considered doubtful. I
applied for transfer to the regular Array or discharge, but this was not
granted, and tJiree times I deserted but was caught again, and discharged from
the Army and awarded twenty months' imprisonment.
I went to Berlin and continued as lorry-driver's mate until 1940, when
I was arrested and sent to Sachsenhausen, probably because I had applied for
repatriation to Poland. I was sent from Sachsenhausen to Grosse Rosen in 1942,
then to Halban labour camp in 194-4, and rdached Belsen in February 1945*	The
only position of authority I held at Belsen was 3 days as lager alteste.
Charged. You are charged with the following offences at Belsen:-
Beating your fellow prisoners
Do you understand the charge?
Reply,
Yes.
CdSBRned, You are not obliged to say anything in answer to the charge, but may make a
statement if you wish. If you do make a statement, it will be written down
and may be used in evidence.

I desire to make a statement
Reply,
Statement It is quite untrue that I ever beat any of my fellow prisoners. Even during
the three days when I was deputising as lager alteste. I was already sick
with typhus, and in no physical condition myself to hurt anyone else. I ]
of
accused.
I had
spoken to the lager alteste about getting a position in which I would get more
food, and can only duppose that this fact, coupled with the general hatred of
Germans throughout these camps, has caused these accusations to be made.
I do not speak Polish.
I would like thepfollowing witnesses called in my defence:-
Doctor ZASEK (Polish), DOLINSKI (Polish), Stasek KASMARBK (Polish), and
KRUGER (German).

bngefahr ein Drittel der •;hftlings atarben auf dem hirech entweder
an UnterernHhrung Oder sie warden erechoeaen, wenn- aio v.sgen ‘chwa-

Belsen an und ich bekara dort Kleckfieber und lag im Revier.
Inzwiscnen wurde iiolsen von den Gngiandern befreit und ich wurde
veriiaftew, ala icia aufstehen konnte.
Ich gebe zu, d&ss ich oft riMftlingo geschlagen habe und dass
ilaftiinge vor aejnen Augen an den Folgen rciner SchMge geotorben
sind,
Als ich in Gross Rosen vom RapportfUhrer UnterscfcarfUhrer Helmut
Esohner als LagerHltester eingese'tzt wurde, erklSrte er, da	|
ich das ?echt Jahtte, die .Niftlinge zu schlagen, us die Ordnung	;
in Gager aufreokt zu erhalten. Las gait auch fttr Halbau, denn	I
dieses lager unterstand auch Gross Rosen.	:
Die Hationalitht der von Mr Ceschlagenen war grdsstenteils	I
polnisch und ruesiBch. Unter .seiner Aufoicht in Halbau waren aber I
auch fc oder 7 Franzoseh. In Gross Rosen waren 70 - 80 Poles,	I
15 $ Ruscen, der geringe Rect bostand aus Bautsdhen und Franzes#- I﻿V

In Halbau war ungefMhr dleaelba Susammenaetzunc, nur	dort

;ickenstieien, oft auch nit A r Hand. Oft haben. dies© beiden und
auch and ere ;:S Manner Haftlinge so schwer gesohlagen, daaa si® ins
Heviar din.;eli@fert warden nuBsten. '.usserdeta iiabe ukrainische
SS Leute oft Haftlinge grandios auf dem ' arach zur Arbeit in der
P^briK orscnossen. In Gross '{•■•*sen habe ich -'it gesehen, dass ^
Haft Ling® vo« Unterscharfisiirer Helmut Sschaer, vow Lagtrftthrar
Obereturxafiihrer Ernstberg Oder vora Blockftthrer Untersonar: Uhrer

fielea, sohrie er : Has, u hast rich • ngerempextiunci erachoss

Ala Blockaitester in Gross rtoaen hatte ich den Siugengatolock unter
mir und unter den Tranaporten, die hereinkaraen, wi.ren z.B. die
Ggx’&iagenen vom larsohauer Auf at end Oder Geiseln aus Helen. Hach
£.nkleimn/, in Hliftliageuaiforia blieben die auJ mexner ■ 'iodk» bis
der nachste 'Xr ana port erwartet wurde. Ich bekam tiiglich sine lute
aus der : chreibatube rat 20 bis 50 If amen und Numaern von Hhftl in-
gen, die vor der ‘chreibatub® anzutreten hot-ten. Piese Hb'ftlinge
warden dann nnch kurzer : herurilfung tier Husxnern zum Krematsrium
hinauf gef Uhrt. Binige Blocklilteste hat ten auf sie aufzupaaaen,
auch ich hatte oft diesen Dienst und die Haftlinge warden dann
auf des Vorhof des Krematoriuiaa durch BlausMure Injektionen,
durch. IIMjagen oder Eraohiessung getdtet. Die Injektionen warden
von einem S3 3anit&tsheiIgehilfen ait dem dang HauptacharfUiirer﻿2
f
gemacht, das Hangen von 2 SS Leuten, einem Unterscharfuhrer
und einem Sottenfiihrer mit Assistenz von einem 'dleutschen und
einem russischen Haftling ausgefuhrt. Die Erschiessungen warden
von 4 BS Bloekfuhrern unter Kommando von Ernstberg durchgefuhrt.
Wir Blockaltesten hatten dafur zu sorgen, dass die zum lode
bestimmten Haftlinge nicht davonliefen Oder sich wehrten. Dabei
warden wir von S3 Leaten mit Mascliinen Pistolen anterstiitzt.
Gross Rosen war ein Vernichtangslager.
Aaf die Anschaldigangen gegen micii gebe ich za, dass ich oft in
meiner Eigensciiaft als Stabendienst, Blockaltester and Lageialte—
ster Haftlinge' geschlagen babe. Haftlinge sind aach infolge der
von mir verabreichten Schlage gestorben. Andererseits v/arde icb
ja aach selbst geschlagen, sogar als ich nageraltester war and
oftbmasste ich andere schlagen, am Ordnang za halten. Mancnmal
warde mir das von der S3 aafgetragen, manchmal tat ich es aas
eigenem Antrieb. Wissentlich and absichtlich habe ich niemand
totgeschlagen. Dass ich geschlagen habe, hat als Grand meine
Eeigheit and die itngxi Eeigheit vor dem eigenen Tod. Die ganze
Handlangsweise warde von dea Lagerftihrer and den Blockfiihrern
von ans gefordert. Ich will mich damit nicht entschaldigen,
es lag nar so im Sjrstem der Konzentrationslager and ich nehme
die Polgen aaf mich.
Viele Haftlinge sind aaf Grand .meiner Anordnangen Oder an den
Polgen meig.er Schlage gestorben. Etliche haben sich selbst er-
hangt, well ihnen darch meine Anordnangen das Leben im Block
zar Qaal warde. Die Anschaldigangen, die gegen mich erhoben
werden, sind noch gar nicht das Argste, weil so viele Opfer
nicht mehr leben and Zeagnis gegen mich ablegen kbnnen.
Iph war der einzige Haftling meines Uamens in den lagern and
eine Yerwechslang kann nicht vorliegen.﻿SWORN BY THE SAID DEPONENT

WCTS, ATlOHOg: 3TATMT Br..>TrfflISI4fg ;UDSmM.
I would like to give the facts of my activity as
Block Altester in GR03SR0SEN. In 1943 I was made block
Alteher 'oy the Laserful^er Aaton TUMAI® and ™| ?ut in charg^
nf hloclc 8. I could not refuse this work. j.o* transports ^
?Lt SriTCd cane from Poland and' X received orders from tno
Werfuhrer and my Block Lead or to heat these people
mercilessly because they were partisans. Several Blockleaders
nSd to come every day to heat the prisoners mercilessly and
on -omSbccasions started shooting. Unfortunately I was xorced
?S participate in this and therefore have beaten many
prisoners to death, others died afterwards on account of the
mal treatment.
I can name especially TJhterscharfuhrer USOHA JUCH^IL
who used to healths prisoners with a rubber tube and also £
with the legs of a stoo* without any repson at all. Men *
the ouisoner was lying on the g round and could not get up
again he was shot by the above named.
I n-ive the following names of Blockleaders from GROSS
ROSEN who were very cruel to the prisoners: Unterscharfuhrer
CrUCHALEK, KLITSCH, BART, SCHRAMM, HIRSAK, HANKE, 'fflSISS,
KORtTACK, SCHWARZS, GALLASCH, JUSCHKEh To describe the
various cruelties committed by these SS men would talce too long
I would like to say that if I ha<£ not cooperated with these W.
SS men I would have been beaten up myself. On one occasion
I was threaten oy Blockleader HIRSAK with a pistol to the **■
effect that if he saw a certain prisoner still alive in the
evening I would be shot instead;because I was a coward I
fulfilled the order and became a murderer. Therefore I ask
for the punishment I deserve.
In 1943 I v/as suppsed to join the Waffen SS but was sick
and ca me into the Hospital therefore I did not jopn the
Waffen SS.
As I have already mentioned prisoners of my block were
sent daily to the Crematorium. I was given the order by
Rapportfuhrer Unterscharfuhrer ESCIMER to take all valuablds
gold rings and watches off the new transport of prisoners
and. not to hand it in to,the Store but give it personally to
the Rapportfuhrer which I had to do very often. Had I refused
to do^ this, I would have disappeared on the next occasion.
I would have been either chased, through the guard, chain
and shot or I would have been given poison or beaten to
death.
Or^bne occasion 2,500 prisoners arrived, all Blockaltesters*..
were called, issued with a tkxskx stick and givren the order
by the Lagerfulirer to hit amongst the prisoners mercilessly.
These prisoners had to stand outside for two days and two nights,
whilst their particulars were taken , their hair fe.ved off ,
clothing taken away and they had to stand, naked and were tdc en
afterwards to the bath,this took place in February during a
heavy Snow Storm. HundirgC’s of Prisoners died as a result of* hv
the cold, others were beaten and shot to death.Within two MonthJr^1
not one person of this transport was alive.I also took part
in this.
There was a.special camp for these 2500 prisoners and every
night the S.D.G.came in to the camp with a Bottle of Alcohol
which was mixed with Cyanide and asked the prisoners whether
any of them were ill.Those that answered him had to undress and
lie down in a single line, they were then given a "Schnaps’1 out
of the bottle and they died in a few minutes.This ?/as part of
the d.ail;r routine in GROSSROSEN and took place in the presence
of several other Blockleaders.﻿-2-
It'v/as just as cruel'on the workingsite. About 10 - 20 prisoners were
“riven eve. y day over the guard chain and were shot. About 5-10
risoners used to go there on their own account because they did not want
oo live any longer. Blockleader KLITSCH, BAIT, HANKS and SCHHffiMEL argued
about it as to who had driven the most prisoners over the chain. The SS
guard that ms shooting was given three days leave and 20 marks "head money".
The victims were already selected in the
Block by the Elockleader. The proceedure was as follows. The blofekleader
gave numbers of prisoners to the Block Altester in respect of the prisoners
that were due for extermination and who had to run over the guard chain.
The Block Altester then gave these numbers to the Capo with the remark that
these prisoners had to disappear by tonight. As a regard for this the Capo ^
came and collected the bread, butter and sausage of the prisoners that tbere
sent through the chain. This was in agreement with the instructions given
by the Camp Commandant. Therefore every Blockleader, Block Altester,
Stubendienst and Capo had the chance to exterminate every prisoner whom he
disliked against a regard. This was carried out by all Bly.'rifle,-." !c f’S-j Block
Altesters, Stubendientt, and Capo to the full extent, because if they would
not ’nave done this they Uieniselves would have been punished in the same way.
In the block itself, the prisoners were driven mad through beatings,"sport"
and maltreatment for no reason at all. For the smallest happening the
Block was punished by talcing away the butter, sausage or bread. The
Block Altester had to make a parcel containing butter and sausage and bring
it to the Blockleader, or the Block Altester had to bring money,watches or
gold teeth.
The gold teeth were broken out from
the dead and if neccesary from those that were alive as well. Therefore
prisoners who had a lot of gold teeth had to die quickly. On account
of this there was a big trading in gold going on in the Gamp. For
gold one could buy everything that was wanted in the Camp, even the finest
drinks. Everything was taken away from the neve arrivals in the Camp.
In my Block the SS Doctor, whose name I have forgotten, came and selected
6 prisoners with gotbd teeth and a well shaped head and gave me the order
to take them to the crematorium. There the victims wer-- given an
cyanide injection and their heads were preserved. This happened very often
but where the heads were sent to is beyond my knowledge. Of these cruelties
I could write a complete book but I think that it is very well known and that
my story is believed and I am not looked upon as being crazy.
Later on I was made Lager Altester by
the Lagerfuhrer because he was satisfied with me. I was given 2000 prisoners
and went with a transport to HALBAU. This took place in June 1943* We
were sent there to 'work in a factory fer war material. Firstly vie built our
Gamp and were given very bad food. Many died of undernourishment and many
were beaten with the rifle butts so that they were unable to work. On one
occasion our dinner, which was at the beginning cooked in the factory, was
poisoned but whether this was done on purpose I do not know. The doctor, a
prisoner, named SASSCHECK, who case from Poland, examined some of the prisoners
who had died and said that they had died from poisoning. The report I made
to GROSS ROSIN about this was resulted in my being given 25 strokes for making
a false statement. I received this beating in spite of me being Lager
Altester. It would be of some interest to know the orders which I received
in the last four months at GROSS RBSEN "I was firstly nominated as honorable
prisoner with all privileges given to me. I ’was allowed to dress in civilian
clothing, Which I did, I was further allowed to write letters every week, I
did not have to take my bat off to the SS men,and several other things.
Further orders were to watch the prisoners in the factory to see that they
did not sabotage the work but to see that they worked hard and -swell. I was
given permission to punish prisoners with 25 strokes for minor offences, but
major offences I had to report to GROSS ROSEN.	I,further,had to prevent
the escape of any prisoners.
1	On account of transport difficulties I have
hanged prisoners who committed sabotage and who tried to escape. I admit﻿-3-
this without trying to apologise because it does not alter the plain facts.
I want to express myself correctly and truly and not whine for this rotten
life now everything is over just because the SS are cowards and whining
for their lives.
I know that I have destroyed my life by
giving this statement of accusations against myself and because 1 can see
that my offences have to be brought to justice**I decided to make this
statement as, in spite of the evidence against me, I was treated in a
humane manner by the British authorities and the Investigating Officer*
a thing which I have not been used to* whilst I was a prisoner with the
Germans, and I hope that this statement will not alter this tre: tmcicfc.
I am at your disposal will give all evidence as is required,within my
knowledge.	I realise the consequences and fully understand the result
it will have for me,	I am completely worn out, both physically and
mentally, by life in this world, but I am too much of a coward to commit
suicide.	I have quite a lot more to say but I think that this statement
will be sufficient but should there be any further interrogations -I will
be only too pleased to give the. correct and true answers.
I -mow wish to say something about the inarch
from HALBAU to BilLSEN* which took place in February 19^-5* We left H/sLBMJ
in the evening at 6 oclock and marched throughout the night. I had saved
rations for a few days. Our kommandofuhrer Hauptscl arfuhrer HESSHAUS went
in every town for traveiring ration cards and therefore could have got
sufficient rations but did not do so and usee these cards for distribution
amongst the guards and himself. The result of this was that prisoners
collapsed. For this purpose I managed to get a wagon which was towed
by prisoners and those that could not march any more were put onto the
wagon. In the evening the wagon was so loaded that the prisoners who
were pulling it also collapsed. In the next forest the prisoners were
unloaded from the wagon and shot under the most cruel circumstances. I
would not like to describe this scene closer. I very often asked the
guard to kill prisoners who had not been killed outright by the first
shot, so that the would hot be buried whilst the}*: were still alive, 4,.
1 offer/ed him cigarettes of which I had plentjt. On one occasion shots
were fired into a group of 20 prisoners without aim. Two of these were
not hit and pretended that they were dead.	Konmandofuhrer HESSHAUS noticed
this and gave me the order to bury these two people alive. I intended to
say something to this but ms threatened with a machine pistol and was
forced to have this orde. carrjed out by two Block Altesters. Between 10
and 20 prisoners were shot every day as they could not march any longer.
I now ask myself where is the Lord's judgement
to expiate these mis-deeds, and when the murderers are caught they
unfortunately have only one death. I would like to be once more Lager
Altester in charge of all these SS men and show them all that what they
themselves have taught me. I beg and request that this my statement
should be written down and be produced as a statement. I shall sign it
and bring witnesses to the effect that this is the truth.
In a shed where we stayed for a night two
prisoners tried to escape through the roof. This was noticed and one
of them ms shot and the other was severely wounded. Both were loaded
onto the wagon. The wounded man having been shot in the abddmen and
he was screaming terribly. Medical attention was of course out of the
question, and I asked the guard to shoot the man in the head so that he
would not suffer any longer. The answer was "A bullet is too good for
him". This prisoner was buried alive in spite of his screams.
I could carry on with my statement. I as
Lager Altester had to co-operate and watch all these happenings. .,hat
it looks like inside me today no one can imagine. I still cant understand
whv I did .all this,it must have been that I wanted to live and because
I am a coward and fr/ightfied of death. Today i think differently. ^ -﻿-4-
•	On arrival in SELSEN we saw what was in store for us
thousand's of dead people were lying in the Barracks and outside.
We arrived in MLSM with approximately 600 prisoners and I dont think
that 300 of them are still alive.

With this I will end my statement which I am sorry
to say is the truth,and which I have given on ny cam account v/ithout
having been forced or asked to give. All former prisoners of HALM.U
and GROSSEOShN can give the same statement and some more.

TAKM AT HOffl'ffi (Belsen) CAMP this 12th day of October 1945 by the
undersigned Captain RONALD PERCY BENTHAM-GREEN, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
Yy name is Anselm PILAHBK. I was born on the 12th June 1905 at
LAURAHUTTE, Upper •SILESIA. I was a land worker and assistant to a horse
dealer. I am a German national but my mother and father were Polish. In
1956 I was in a place called NEURODE, near GLATZ, when a public address by
GOEBHELS was being relayed to the public. I and my friends were drunk and
I kicked the loud-speaker with my foot making, at the same time, derogatory
remarks. I was sentenced to four years imprisonment for that offence but
served only one year when I was sent to a Camp at ESTERWEGE. My term should
have expired in 1941 but -instead of being released, I was sent to AUSCHWITZ
where I remained until June 1944. In AUSCHWITZ, until 1945, I was an o
ordinary prisoner but in the Spring of 1945 a vacancy for a foreman arose
and I was given the job. I was released to become a German Soldier in the
S3, and took the opportunity to escape and remained in hiding until the
capitulation.
You are charged with the following offences at AUSCHWITZ
1.	Working for the SS to the prejudice of your fellow prisoners.
2.	Beatings of, and gross cruelty to, your fellow prisoners.
Do you understand the charges made against you?
Yes.
You are not compelled to niake a statement but may do so if you wish and
it will be taken down and may be used in evidence.
I desire to make a statement.
It is true. Now and then I have hit a man in the face with ny hand or
on the back with a stick. I had to supervise,once a week, the dishing out of
food for a thousand men. There were some young men who had three dishes for
food instead of one. I warned such people that if they continued the
practice there would not be enough food for everyone. When they continued
to do this, I hit them under provocation because they were abusive as well,
I was working in a wood cutting department with my gang and I was held
responsible for the workmanship. There were young chaps who purposely
kicked the planed planks into the mud so that they were not clean. I was
beaten by the SS if the wood was not clean and I bear marks to this day.
In 1942 the SS broke my jaw and knocked out one of my kidneys. I bad the
choice of either reporting a man for disobedience, when he would be beaten on
a table, or beating them myself. I prefered to beat them myself. When the
Jews came into the camp the Poles took advantage of this and stole their food
and clothes. When this was reported to me by the Jews, I beat the men who
had done this and put matter right.
I had to keep a book of those who had offended against the rules and the
SS examined the book and took the offenders and administerred an official
beating which was very brutal. I preferred to punish them myself. I never
used the book.
I desire to call the following witnesses on my behalf

My full name is Use Emilia STEINBUSCH. My home address is:
RECKLINGHAUSEN-,' Horst Wessel Stra.sse 15. I am aged 23, and was
horn on 22 May 1922. I am of German nationality.
I was drafted into the S3 at FURSTENBERG near BRESLAU hy the
Labour Officer there. On joining the SS I went to LANGENBILAU
for training from 25 Nov to 25 Dec 44. I then went to ZILLERTHAL
and ERDHAMSDORF. At LANGENBILAU we received lectures from.
Hauptsturrnfuhrer ULRICHT as to our attitude towards internees; we
were told we must have no contact whatever with internees, that" we
must not ill-treat them, hut report any irregularities.
My job was S3 Supervisor over 500 women internees.
On 15 Feb 45 I went to MOEHEHSTEIN. I was a Supervisor on a
transport te ing 300 internees there. I was at MCRCHENSTEIN from
27 Feb to 10 Mar 45. I had a bad foot and consequently had no
duties on this transport; all Supervisors had to go. At this camp
I was on camp duties on arrival. I was able to do. duties at the
^ Camp on arrival because I wasableto sit down. The prisoners were
w housed in an empty factory. My job as a supervisor was to supervise
internee prisoners at all times; if they disobeyed an order I had.
to report it to my superior.
on 10 Mar 45 1 went to GROSS WERTE, near A&ffSHAUSEN. I
^J supervised prisoners there until 20th March andwas then admitted to
Hospital suffering with a septic foot. I was discharged from
Hospital on 3 Apn 45, and went to NEUENGAMME; I was not a supervisor,
and went back to BELSEN on 13 Apr 45. I was told by KRAMER that
the reason why I went to BELSEN was that five supervisors had fled
and that we had to take their place. I was told this on arrival at
BELSEN.	On arrival there I went to bed suffering with a bad foot.
I was taken prisoner on the 17 Apr 45
I left my identity papers in my room at BELSEN; I was called
on parade and had no chance to go back andget them.

19th February 1922. I am of German nationality. 0-n 11 Jan 45
I was conscripted as a Supervisor,employed by the SS by a
Doktor* HAUSSLER, who was in charge of the Staff at KittelDeutsche
ute&iy
a Foreman of the Labour Office
^ Motoren Werken, MOROUBNSTEINj^
I did not volunteer.
From 11 Jan 45 for three weeks I was trained at LANGENBILAU.
?/e received clothing and were instructed^mat attitude to adopt
towards internees. We were told that we must not ill-treat or oeat
them. We received written instructions as to our treatment of
the internees, but after one hour they were taken away again.
We had to readthrough them, andthen signed a paper stating that we
would not beat or ill-treat prisoners. These signed papers were
then collected.
After this course of instructions I went back to MGEHENSTBIH
to an ordnance Factory to supervise prisoners.	This was the
place at which I wasemplyed be fore I joined the SS. The prisoners
were Jewish internees. I was there until 9 Mar 45. The internees
arrived on the g 15 Feb 45. Fhora there I went to GROSSWBRTE, near
IdQFOKAUSEN, where I stayed until 23 Mar 45. I was supervising
internees; this meant that I had to keep order amongst the prisoners
and see that they did not escape. No internees escaped during
this time; if any had, my orders were to report the matter. I
fell sick at GRCS SWERTE with stomach trouble and was taken to a
^/Convalescent Home at mtfBHAUSEN, in the Concentration Camp. On
^ the 5 Apr 45 I leff Hospital andwent back to GROSS WERTE. The
following day I went to"KLEIN BODINGEN. At this place there was a

I went to BELSEN on 6 Apr 45 andarrived on the 11th. We were
in BELSEN for one night; the next morning we went to NEUSNGAHME,

came from that we should go to NEUENGAMME; there v/ere approximately
25 of us including VOLKENRATH? EHLERT, and all the accusea now

their names. I returned to BELSEN the next day, the loth, and
was in charge of 50 prisoners for two days. I remained in BELSEN
until the 17 Apr 45 when I was taken prisoner.
My pauers were left at BELSEN. My identity card was taken
from me by British troops. X have no papers now.
I have only ever seen one SS Woman beat up prisoners; her name
is KOWA. I saw her beat up women prisoners in February 1945 using
her hand; she beat a woman up thoroughly on the neck and hack. I
do not know why she did this. I lost contact with KOWA at_kORCHnN

My full name is Hildegard^ Johanna KAKBACH. I was born on
17th February 192S at HIRSCHBICRG, Silesia. i m of German
nationality. My home address is? Dalienweg 1, H1RSCHB3RG? Silesia.
#/vX	the SS on 6 Dec 44, andreceived initial training at
LAl'IG^ISLAU. I was trained as a Supervisor in a prison Camp.
On 2 Apu 45 I was sent from the Training Centre to ZILL32RTHAL,
in Silesia. This was a small Concentration Carnp containing 500
internees. The person in charge was Frau ZI3HJ3. I was a Super-
visor - general duties.
Other Supervisors in £ILIERTHAL ?;ere.: Klara OPITZ, Margot KORNE,
Gerda SCHOEN, Maria >PODSOKOifTER, Margareta. MEISSKER. In all, there
were about 25 supervisors. * I left this Camp on 14 Feb 45 to take
a transport of 500 internees to MORCHENSTEIII, in Sudetenland. I
was not in charge of these internees, but was only a supervisor.
The woman in charge was Frau ZTEHE. The second in command was
BSRl'IIKAU; the other SS Women were just supervisors. The prisoners
had to walk to PETERSDORF sndfrom there they went by train. I
travelled in one of the trucks. My duty waste see that none of the
prisoners escaped. I received no special orders as to how to
prevents esbapes. I was unarmed and could not have prevented an
escape if it were attempted. None cf my prisoners attempted to
escape and I do not know what would have happened if they had.
The journey ended on 16 pub 4.5. The internees were then
employed in an ordnance .Factory and I continued to be a Supervisor
at M0RCIIENST1IN. I was at this Camp until the 9th or 10th
March 45 and then went to GROSS WERTE near SACHSENKAUSEN. I left
MORCHENSTEIN because the Factory closed down and was moved to.
GROSS WERTE. All the Camp Staff from MORCHENSTEIN moved to
GROSS WERTE; The woman in charge was named PETSRMANN, who came

BELSEN. I was told by the Commandant at BEIffiN that he had to have.
25 female Staff to hand over to the British; five had escaped and
so five were called from NEUENGAMSE and taken back to BEISEN. I
was one of the five. At BELSEN I had to supervise internees who
had to clear up the old Camp. This was not under the supervision of
the British; they arrived on the 15 Apr 45. when the British came
I had no duties, andwas taken prisoner on the 17 Apr 45. At no time
during my career was I armed. I have never seen any supervisor
beat up or ill treat any internee. I was drafted into the SS by

My full name is Emil KLTSGUO. My home address is
PRESSBURGy(Bratislava^ Peldthasse 15. I am of German
nationality, and was horn on 35 Sep 1910 at BRATISLAVA.
I left BRATISLAVA when I joined the German Anmy 0$
11 Feh 43; I was posted to a unit guarding P017 at BUCHENWALD
Concentration Camp on 19 Feh 43,, where I wasa waiter in the
officers* mess. I left this joh in early December 1944
The Commandant at BUCH1F-7ALD was Sturmbannfuhrer otto
FURSTNER.. The second in command was Sturmbannfuhrer BAEHR
from AUSCHWITZ. The Adjutant was named T33TMERS. Other
officers were* Unterstumfuhrer .RITZ, Untersturrafuhrer
BERGMEIER, Untersturrafuhrer KRASOVSKY, Obersturrafuhrer KOLLHAR,
Hauptsturmfuhrer BREKNEIS, Obersturmfuhrer Doktor KARL,
Unterstumfuhrer Doktor KURZKE, Hauptsturmfuhrer STAU3E ,'THAL,.
Hauptsturrafuhrer KLEIM, Hauntstumfuhrer FROHIE
I left BUCHEK/i/ALD because I was transferred to the SS
Kitchen in December, since officers arriving from AUSCHWITZ
brought their own staff. I was in-this Kitchen until 5 &pn 45»
fhen I was transferred to DORA, Nordhausen, in December 43.
At DORA I was an orderly in the Mens’ Mess room until 5 Apr 45.
The S3 men in this messwere guards. Hauptstumfuhrer KREUTZER
can confirm that I was in the Kitchen - he is in this prison.
When I left on 5 Apn 45 we were put in a train which took us to .
ROTLSBROTE. There I handed over all rations to the Red Cross.	(l
From there L'went by bicycle to HEUKAMHSL, near Hambourg,	1
but could not get there and so went to the panzer Barracks at
BERGEN instead.	Hauptstumf uhrer BREMEIS ordered me to go
to NEUKAIIHSL; I was told that a truck would be waiting for us
at NEUKAMMEL. I arrived at BELSEN on 10 Apns45. Two days
later British troops arrived. During those, two days I was
working in the SS cookhouse. Kitchen 19. The SS guards were
stationedin the panzer Barracks.	I was taken prisoner on
11 Apr 45 at 1130.
I was a member of the, SS, and joined on 19 Feb 43. I was
compelled to join by a Sekretar of the BRATISLAVA NSDAP named
Franz KARMASSIN. I did not want to join, but the GESTAPO fetched
me and forced me to join.	I was supposed to have reported
for duty on the II Feh but did not do so. At 2 o'clock in the
morning of 19 Oct officials fetched me from bed and put me
on a train going to BUCHENWALD I was not in agreement with
SS methods; I did not get out of the SS because I ?ras afraid of
the consequences. I do not believe it possible to have got
away.	When I said that I am not in agreement with SS methods
I was referring to the beating up of prisoners. I saw people
being beaten up and knocked about when taken to work in the
mornings, in BUCHENWALD ancj. in DORA. The only specific
instance I can mention,was at Nordhausen, where I saw
Hauptscharfuhrer KN1TTLER beating up men very frequently
with sticks. I have never seen anybody unconscious or severely
wounded as a result. He did not beat them very sevrely
I did not see much myself; I heard about people being maltreated
and mis-hrndled; p believe what I was told about the methods of
the SS. I made no effort to find out for myself-baccuse it
did not interest me in the least; I could not hav e done
anything in any case. I did not know what the SS were
when I joined up. I would haelost my life if I had not
continued to serve in the SS. I applied to join the Tank
Corps at BUCHENWALD in March 43. I applied to Qberscharfuhrer
FRANZE. This was refused. I applied for a transfer because
frd'fiUtMttoifighta|tat|eo|r^at;g^ was not afraid to fight at the
-1-﻿X never saw any cases- of shooting myself, but I heard people
talking about shootings of prisoners by the S3. I was always
employed either in the officers or the mens messes, and never
went into the camp proper.
My identity papers were taken from me by a British officer
at BERGEN. I was pleased to see the British at BERGEN

My name is Ferdinand CROSSE. I am of German nationality and vas bom at

as a painter -with the firm of Ritter and Trilling, at Cologne; I was then called
up for the labour service but deserted in 1937. I was arrested	by the
Germmpolice in February 1938 and taken to the civilian jail at Cologne.
Towards the end of 1938 I was -transferred to the punitive camp at BABMBURG,

I desire to make a statement.
I load no function before I came to AHLrM Concentration Camp. I am the only
German who stayed behind when the S3 left the Camp, all the others escaped
with the S3. I did this because I had no bad conscious or otherwise I should have|
gone away with the others.
' Another Capo named KRAUSE Emil is In Celle Jail and a Capo by the name of
ETORR Ludwig is at present at Carnap 7, Estervegen. These two badly ill-treated
the prisoners. KNORR often used to beat the prisoners oO death during
working hours but I myself stayed in the Coop. Often the civilian workers with
us complained about KNOBS*
My only desire is to see that the other people are also brought into this,
that'means that 1 can defend myself much better. I do not know any 'v/itness as

Deposition on oath, of Johann SCBlTiiEZHUHEffi, male, of No. 13 SIEGERSHOPEN,
near AUGSBQBG, BA.VAPIA, GIB/IANY, sworn before Captain George Macpherson
HEARD, Royal Artillery, of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team at NEIBSHG-AKK^
on the 23rd of January 1946.
1.	I entered the SS, as a Cadet, on the 8th April 1933 and
from the 5th May 1933 to the 1st March 1935 was stationed at an Infantry
Training College at DACHAU. On the 1st March 1935 I was transferred to
the Concentration Camp at DACHAU where I was a'ELockleader until JulJ 1937
and then Rappcrtfuhrer until 31st August 1938«
2.	On the 1st September 1938 I was transferred to the
Concentration Camp at SACHSMHAUSEN as ObersckErfuhrer and in November
1938 was promoted to Hauptscliarfuhrer, I worked there as second E&pport-
fuhrer and later as Kommandofuhrer . I remained at Sachsenliausen until
9th September 1941 •	,
ML v
3.	to the 10th September 1941 I was transferred to the
AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp as an Hauptscharfuhrer and in November 1941 was
promoted to the rank of Untersturafuhrer. At first I was in AUSCHWITZ No.l
and worked there as Komaandofuhrer. I had to control the working parties.
Atdithat time the prisoners whre Poles, Czechs, and Germans; there were
approximately 6-7 thousand prisoners in the caap and about 150 to 200
of these were Germans. The first women to arrive at AJISCffiTITS No.l. were
1000 Germans who were sorted out and made Capos. They were political
prisoners and those who were anti-social and..unwilling to work.
4.	In March 19^i-2 I was: transferred to AUSCHWITZ No..2 as
third SCHUTZHAFT Camp Commandant. This Camp was known by the name of
HERFUNAU. At the time there were only 2500 men there but other transports
increased.that number to 14000 by September 1942. As Camp Commandant I
was responsible for the entire second Camp. The first women arrived in
Camp 2 in April or May 1943 and then the entire womens camp of AUSCHWITZ
No.l were transferred to No.2. I believe there were about 20000 of them;
approximately 2500 to 3000 of these were Germans^ aaad the others -mere Poles,
Czechs, French, Belgians, Italians, Hungarians and Russians, but the majority
were.Poles.
5.	.	( , The first gas chamber was built in April 1942 and first
put into use,in June. 1942. At that time 5 or 6 thousand prisoners, men
women and children, were gassed, personally I never had anything to do
with the selections for the gas chamber but I was present when the selections
took place. The prisoners were sorted in the following manner:	They
had to strip completely and then walk through a hut where a doctor stood
two metres away from then and then pointed to the right or left without
first examining the people properly. Those l-o had to move to the left
were destined for the gas chamber. The selections were Made by
Obersturnfuhrer Dr, Fritz KLEIN, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. WIRTHS, Hauptstumfuhrer
Dr. Josef MENGSLE and Hauptsturmfuhrer Josef KRAMER who was the Commandant
of the Camp,
6.	AUSCHWITZ No.3 was known by the name of BUNA and belonged
to the I.G.FARBEN INDUSTRIE. Working parties for this factory were supplied
by AUSCHWITZ No.l. In. November 1943 BUNA became AUSCHWITZ No.3- At that
tine there was a total of 50000 prisoners at AUSCHWITZ 1, 2, and 3.﻿I admit that I have beaten prisoners, approximate
one per day. I always beat then with the open hand, but sometimes I hit
then so hard that they fell to the "round. I used to beat them because
they had stolen something from their co-prisoners or because they would
not submit tc the discipline.and had therefore angered me. It is possible
that I have beaten and kicked women whilst under the influence of alcohol.
Ten times I arrived in the .Camp in a drunken condition and I remember that
once I was so drunk that on the next day I.did not remember what I had
done the day before. Further, I remember an incident when I ordered 0.
step dancer to dance but I did not order her to strip.
8.	Sometimes when I was accompanied by :y black
sheep dog I carried a whip with me but I never used the whip on a
prisoner. Furthermore I-carried a pistol but I never fired this pistol
in the Camp. Whenever I beat prisoners I never gave them more than
two blows, but it is possible that I also kicked them.
9,	The children who were born at AUSCHVTITZ were taken
to the womens camp together with their.mothers in-s©-far-as they were.
Ayrar, but the Jewish children were immediately exterminated. On the
3</4&£. January 1944 I was promoted to the rank of Obersturmfuhrer, but this
made no difference w	to my duties. x left AUSCIiwlTZ on the
1st November 1944»
.n
I then went to the L.
10,
BAVARIA, where I was Camp Commandant of ICAUFERING- 1. There were nine
Camps at KAUFFRING all adsainisterred by DACHAU. I, had 2200 prisoners.
at-KAUFEPiNG 1, mainly Hungarian Jews but there were also' some Lithuanians,
Poles, and seven P.eich.German Ayraas. The prisoners were employed at
building a Mess®rschmitt factory. I left KilUKbSIIJG on the 1st of
January 1945 and had to report to the AKitsgruppe/in OJl'AHENBURG. From
•' there I was sent to RAVENSBRUCK as SCHUTZHAFT, Camp Commandant and I
remained at PAVENSBRUCK until 29th April 1945. I then cams first to
i*,. MALCHGf in MECKLMBURG and later to NMJSTADT C-LE7.1 in MECXLEKBDRG.
From there I went to LUBECK together with the Camp Commandant.of the
RAVENS BROCK Camp.	The name of the Camp Oammandant is SURIN. We had
been ordered to prepare a. new Camp at LUBECK. On the 3rd May 1945
X was taken prisoner by American troops.

sich nackend ausziehen und durch eine.Huette gehen wo der Arzt zwei

No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team at FALLING-BOSTEL on this 24th day
of January, 19A6.

I* am single and of REICH GERMAN nationality,
member of the National Socialist Party.

I have never been a
9	Prom September, 1939, until January, 19W, I was _
unemployed. Prom January, 1940, until January, 19U, I was working
in the Dairy trade. From 19W- (January) until August, 194f, I was a
factory worker at the Hermann-Goring-Werke in SALZGITTER. I was
employed in the Receiving Department.
g	In August, 194A, I was drafted as S3 Supervisor to the
Labour Camp at SALZWEDSL. At first I came to the_Training Camp at
NBUSNGAMME for three days to be clothed and to receive instruction.
i	At NEUENGAMEE an S3 Officer told us the following
concerning the treatment of prisoners (in the form of a lecture,:
It was forbidden to talk to the prisoners privately but it was necessary
to see that they all worked during working hours. It was forbidden to
give Lathing to the prisoners. It was forbidden to beat prisoners:
in case of misconduct the prisoner concerned was to be reported, to ohe
Camp Commandant.
g	At the end of August, 1944-, I came to SALZWEDEL where
I remained until the Camp was taken over by American troops m the middle
of April, 194-5.
6	In August, 1944, the Camp consisted of 500 Hungarian
Jewesses. Later Polish and Greek Jewesses arrived, and shortly ^^ore
the end 500 German political female prisoners arrived. _ ^t ,ne time the
Camp was handed over there were approximately 3, 000 pncnsrs.
7	Mv first dutv at the Camp was the taking over of a
Lhbour Commando, which at the beginning consisted of 100 Hungarian Jewesses.
Later a4> further 50 Polish Jewesses were added. _ No prisoners of any other
nationality were in my Labour Commando at any time.
8.
The time table at the Camp was as follows:
0445 hours Reveille
0500 '
0530	’
054-5	’
0600
0800
Breakfast
Details for work
Setting out of working commandos to factory

" End of Work. (As from December, 1944j work
finished at 1750 hours)
" Supper at the Gamp (the prisoners again received
the soup, they had for dinner)
" Lights 0Dt.
9.	At the factory I never had any cause to be angry with my
people. They worked well. I gave them permission to sit down during
work at all times. Sometimes I had to do night shift work with my
Commando. Night shift was from 1800 hours until 0550 hours. The prisoners
went to sleep frequently on such occasions so that I had to wake thera up.
I shook them by the shoulder and said, "Good morning" to them. I never
beat prisoners since I load no reason for doing so; except for one or two
occasions I never quarrelled. The latter happened sometimes if the
prisoners did not keep order during the serving of food. It also happened
that I had to call them to order sometimes in the morning during Appel,
as they would not fall in line properly. It is possible that in my
excitement I may perhaps have hit them with the open hand across the shoulder
or in the face.
10.	I remember one instance. One prisoner Wats reported to me
by the German forewoman as having been absent for some time. I went to
look for her and found her on the lavatory. I told her to return to work
but she returned only after some time. I was so angered by this that I
hit her in the face with the open hand. I got excited very easily when
prisoners did not behave as they should, and sometimes I even cried on such
occasions. I did not, however, get excited every day.
11,	In January, 1945, I was given a new post in the Guard Room
of the Camp. My job was to #uel fill in Commando chits. I was given
this post because I was ill with some skin disease which caused my hair to
be cut off.
12.	I never worked in the kitchen and never let any of the
prisoners go short of the rations to which they were entitled.. I never
carried a stick.
13,	l visited the Camp Revier solely in order to look after the
sick prisoners of my Commando, or to get medicines for myself.
14.	During my stay at the Camp I reported three prisoners to
the Camp Commandant S3 Hauptsturmfuhrer SCHRADER; he did not, however,
punish them. I reported the prisoners (l) because one of them had tried
three times to draw food (2) because one had been washing her laundry during
working hours at the factory and (3) because one nearly always slept at the
factory.
15.	There were approximately twenty 33 male guards at the Camp.
I remember the name of S3 Oberscharfuhrer ZBMERMANN, who was responsible
for the sanitary welfaxe of the Guards and of the Camp itself. Further,
I remember the name of the Supervisor Amanda WREDE, who was billeted with me
f
16.	Since I never had anything to do in the Camp itself I never
witnessed any beatings in the Camp. I never heard anyone speak of beatings.﻿There was one other Supervisor in the Camp whose name
was Anneliese SCHMIDT. I think she arrived in September or October,
1944, and at first worked as Supervisor at the Factor/. As far as I
can remember she was transferred as Supervisor to the prisoners' kitchen
in December, 1944. She was somewhat smaller in stature and of heavier
build. I hardly believe that she could be mistaken for me. I was
the only one in the Camp whose hair had been cut off. Anneliese SCHMIDT
was never in charge of my Commando.

January 1946.
1.	Ich bin am 5.10.1925 in DUIBURG/HAMBORN geboren. Ich bin le-
dig und habe die reichsdeutsche Staatsangehbrigkeit. Ich war nie-
mals ein Mitglied der N.S.D.A.P.
2.	Ich war vom September 1959 bis zum Januar 1940 unbeschaftigt.
Vom Januar 1940 bis zum Januar 1941 ging ich einer Beschaftigung
im freien Milchhandel nach. In der Zeit vom Januar 1941 bis zum
August 1944 war ich Arbeiterin in den Hermann-Goring-Werken in
SA1ZGITTER. Ich war in der Abnahme-Abteilung beschaftigt.
5. Im August 1944 wurde ich als SS-Aufseherin zum Arbeitslager
SALZWEDEL einberufen. Ich kam zuerst fur 5 Tage zur Einkleidung
und Instruktion in das Ausbildungslager NEUENGAMME.
4.	In NEUENGAMME wurde durch einen SS-Offizier das folgende uber
die Behandlung der Gefangenen (in der Form eines Unterrichts) ge-
sagt: es war verboten sich mit den Gefangenen privat zu unterhalten
es war darauf zu achten, dass wahrend der Arbeitszeit gearbeitet
wurde, es war verboten den Gefangenen irgend etwas zu geben, es
war verboten die Gefangenen zu schlagen, bei schlechtem Verhalten
war iiber die betreffende Gefangene eine Meldung an den Lagerkom-
mandanten zu erstatten.
5.	Von dort aus kam ich, es war gegen Ende August 1944 nach SA1Z-
WEDEl wo ich bis zur Ubernahme des lagers durch amerikanische Trup-
pen Mitte April 1945 verblieb.
6.	Das Lager hatte im August 1944 eine Belegschaft von 500 unga-
rischen Judinnen, Spater kamen polnische und griechische Judinnen
dazu und kurz vor dem Ende 500 deutsche weibliche politische Haft-
linge. Das Lager hatte bei der Gbergabe eine Belegungsstarke von
ca. 5000 Haftlingen.
7.	Meine erste Beschaftigung im Lager war die Ubernahme eines
Arbeitskommandos, das zu Beginn aus 100 ungarischen Jiidinnen be-
stand. Spater wurde dasselbe um 50 polnische Judinnen vermehrt. Es
befanden sich niemals Gefangenea: anderer Nationalitat in meinem
Arbeitskommando.
8.	Der Tagesverlauf im Lager war wie folgt :
0445	Uhr	Wecken
0500	"	Fruhstiick
0550	"	Arbeitseinteilung
0545	"	Abrlicken der	Arbeitskommandos zur Fabrik (5 Minuten
Fussweg)
0600 "	Arbeitsbeginn
0800 "	Fruhstiickspause (die Gefangenen erhielten hier Brot
vom Lager und Kaffee von der Fabrik
0815 "	Arbeitszeit
1145 "	Mittagspause (die Gefangenen erhielten eine Gemuse-
suppe mit Fleisch vom Lager)
1250	"	Arbeitszeit
1700	"	Arbeitsende (ab	Dezember	1944	wurde	die	Arbeitszeit
bis 1750 verlangert)
1800	"	Abendessen im Lager	(die	Gefangenen	erhielten	noch-
mals die gleiche Suppe wie zur Mittagszeit)
2100	"	Zapfenstreich.
9. Ich hatte in der Fabrik nie Arger mit meinen Leuten, sie ar-
beiteten gut. Ich erlaubte ihnen stets sich bei der Arbeit zu set-
zen. Ich hatte mit meinem Kommando auch manchmal Nachtschicht, die
von 1800 Uhr bis 0550 Uhr dauerte. Die Gefangenen schliefen hier-
bei haufig ein, sodass ich sie wecke
n musste. Ich riittelte sie﻿Summary of Examination of Else Katharina SCHMIDT

9.	an der Schulter und sagte guten Morgen zu ihnen. Ich schlug
nie Gefangene, da ich. keine Grande dazu hatte. Ich hatte ausser
einigen wenigen Anlassen niemalis Zank.n-Das letztere ereignete
sich manchmal, wenn die Gefangenen bei der Essenausgabe keine
Ordnung halten wolten. Auch musste ich sie manchmal morgens
beim Apell zur Ordnung rufen, da sie sich haufig nicht richtig
aufstellten. Es ist mbglich, dass ich sie vielleicht dabei in
meiner Aufregung mit der flachen Hand auf die Schulter Oder in
das Gesicht geschlagen habe.
10.	Ich erinnere mich ausserdem noch an eine Begebenheit. Eine
Gefangene wurde mir von der deutschen Vorarbeiterin als schon
seit langerer Zeit abwesend gemeldet. Ich ging und fand dieselbe
auf dem Abort. Ich forderte sie auf zur Arbeit zu kommen, aber
sie kam erst nach einer langeren Zeit zuriick. Ich war dariiber
so aufgeregt, dass ich sie mit der flachen Hand in das Gesicht
schlug. Ich war sehr leicht aufgeregt, wenn sich die Gefangenen
schlecht benahmen und fing manchmal selbst zu weinen an. Ich reg-
te mich aber nicht jeden Tag auf.
11.	Im Januar 1945 erhielt ich einen neuen Posfen auf der
Wachstube des lagers. Meine Beschaftigung bestand im Ausfiillen
von Kommandozetteln. Ich erhielt diesen Posten, well ich krank
war und auf Grund einer Schuppenflechte mir die Kopfhaare hatte
abscheeren milssen.
12.	Ich arbeitete niemals in der Kuche, auch kiirzte ich nie die
Verpflegung der Gefangenen. Ich trug niemals einen Stock.
13.	Ich besuchte das iagerrevier lediglich urn nach den kranken
Gefangenen meines Kommandos zu sehen oder urn rnir selbst Medika-
mente von dort zu holen.
14.	Ich meldete 3 Gefangene wahrend meiner Dienstzeit dem Lager
flihrer SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer SCHRADER, der aber niemals jemanden
bestamft hat. Ich meldete die Haftlinge 1. weil eine versucht
hatte 3 mal Essen zu fassen, 2. weil eine wahrend der Arbeits-
zeit ihre Wasche in der Fabrik gewaschen hatte und 3. weil eine
fast standig in der Fabrik schlief.
15. Die mannliche Bewachung des Lager bestand aus ca. 20 SS-Ieu-
ten. Ich erinnere noch den Namen des SS-Oberscharfuhrers ZIMMER-
MAM, der die sanitare Betreuung der Wachmannschaften und des
Lagers unter sich hatte. Ferner erinnere ich den llamen der Aufsdh
herin Amanda WREDE, die mit mir zusammen wohnte.
16.	Ich habe nie Schlagereien im Lager gesehen, da ich nie inner
halb des Lager zu tun hatte. Ich horte auch nie liber Schlagereiem
sprechen.
17.	Es gab noch eine andere Aufseherin namens SCHMIDT, Annelie^e
im Lager. Diese kam glaube ich im September oder Oktober 1944 sum
Lager und arbeitete zuerst in der Fabrik als Aufsehrin. Soweit
ich mich erinnern kann kam sie im Dezember 1944 in die Gefangenen-
Kuche als Aufsicht. Sie war etwas kleiner an Gestalt und krafti-
ger gebaut. Ich glaube kaun, dass man sie mit mir verwechseln
kbnnte. Ich war die einzige im Lager,die die Haare abgeschnitten
hatte. Anneliese SCHMIDT hat nie mein Kommando beaufsichtigt.

Training Centre, MONZING'EN, Camp Peldstatten. In March, 1940, I went
via HOLLAND and	to ARRAS, where I went into action. I was
wounded on the 26th May, 1940, went through different hospitals, and was
discharged later at LIMBURG on the LABN. I then went to FRANCE again
for "two" days, and from there to the 3r<i SS Infantry Reserve Battalion at
BRESLAU.
3.	i then attended a Course on Administration and.came to
the WIRTSCHAFTS VERWELTUNG HAUPTAMT, ORANIENBURG, as Administrator
for clothing. At the end of August, 1940, I came to the Administration
HQ of the Concentration Camp FLOSSENBURG, and remained there until October,
1943, as in an administrative capacity. At the end of 1942 I became a
specialist on SS and prisoner clothing. At that time there were between
4,000 and 5,000 prisoners there - Poles, Czechs, Germans and Russians. The
if. Commandants were Oberstunabannfuhrer KONZLER and Ooersturmbannfuhrer
KOGEL.
4.	In November, 1943, I was transferred to the 3rd Germanischen
Panzertruppe to NARWA in RUSSIA in an adninistrative capacity. There
I was promoted to the rank of Oberscharfuhrer in February, 1944. In
September, 1944, I went to BERLIN and was sent from there to the Labour
Camp wr.Tf on the Donau an administrator of clothing. This Camp belonged
to the Concentration Camp I, MAUTHAUSEN under the Command of Obersturmfuhrer
LUD0LF. On the 5th December, 1944, I was transferred to the administration
HQ, MITTELBAU, of the Concentration Camp DORA at clothing specialist.
The Commandant of the Camp was Obersturmfuhrer Franz HCSSLER.
5.	in April, 1945 - I cannot quite remember the exact date,
but it was after Easter - I went with the administration of DORA to the^
Concentration Camp BEESBN. The prisoners had already been sent to BEL SEN;
some of them by train. The others had to march. I was not ^present on
that march. I was in Camp 2 at BELSEN and had to draw rations xor t e
prisoners from the Wehrmachts Food Office. I remember an incident at
Camp 2 when prisoners attempted to occupy the Food Magazine. This happened
on the second or third day after my arrival. I was in the kitchen and﻿- 2 ~
heard somebody say that the prisoners were trying to take the Magazine.
I went outside and saw twenty or twenty-five prisoners ih front of the
Magazine. They were armed with sticks. I then drew my pistol and
fired two or three shots in the air. The prisoners then dispersed and
ran into the blocks. I went to the Magazine to ascertain whether the
prisoners had stolen anything, but all I could see was that two windows
had been smashed in. I did not worry any more about the incident since
the sentries were looking on and I therefore returned home.
6.	I never hit or kicked any r^risoner intentionally, but I
adroit having pushed some prisoners on the second or third day after ray
arrival. I was in the kitchen and the prisoners stood outside the front
door to collect food. The cook said that it would be about ten rainutes
before food could be served and the prisoners then tried to get into the
kitchen, just at the moment when I was trying to get out.	The entrance
was therefore rather crowded and I had to push my way through in order to
get out into the open.
7.	I also remember an incident when I stood in the first
kitchen and saw a group of prisoners who worked in the Gamp as medical
orderlies carry five or six dead past the kitchen. They deposited than
on an open square near the kitchen. I saw blood on the clothing of the
dead but do not know who is responsible for the death of these people.
8.	On the third day after my arrival I was sent to the
Concentration Camp NMJMGMME together with fifteen other S3 men, where
we had to report to Obersturmfuhrer HOOKER. We remained there for five
days and then oame to the active unit DUSEN SCHO'SN and were sent to the
LMGMHOEN Barracks at HAMBURG. On the 2nd May, 191-5» we went from there
to HSIDE, near FLETTSBURG and were discharged from the active unit
DUSEN SCHOEN on the 7th May, 1945.
9.	I then tried to get home but only got as far as BURG
in DITHMARSCHEN. There I received the order from Oberst KNATJST that
all members of the Wehrmachts load to report to the Burgomaster. I reported
on the 11th May, 1945, came to the Camp AVELAK on the Kaiser Wilhelm K
Canal. There all members of the S3 had to report and I reported to
Company Head Oberleutenant LECHMAHN.	I was then sent to the S3 Camp
TENNSBUTTHL and from there on the 19th July, 1945, to NEUEITGAMME.
10.	At NEUENGAMM3 I met SS Oberscharfuhrer Fritz WMNER.
I know WAGNER from the DORA Concentration Camp where he was in charge
of accommodation, and responsible for the accommodation of S3 personnel and
prisoners. I was together with him at DORA from the time of my arrival
there on the 5th December, 1944, until the Camp was dissolved. ’WAGNER
had arrived several weeks before me# IfA&WER is approximately 35	3^
years old, 1*70 to 1.74 metres tall, dark blond haxr, clean shaven, and has
smooth hair, brushed back. I never saw WAGNER beat any prisoner but
he reprimanded, prisoners from time to time if one of them had stolen
something and had been discovered.. WAGNER came from the S3 Camp
TENNSBUTTEL to NEUENGAMME together with me.
IX,	I admit that I sometimes boxed the ears of different
prisoners because they had stolen something from the clothing depot.
X discovered five or six prisoners who had stolen clotiling and boxed
the ears of three or four of these. The other two I only reprimanded
and let it go at that. H((This happened on different days at the DORA
Concentration Camp. If I/l?ound out a Geiraan soldier who had stolen
anything I would have had to report him and he would have been brought
before a Court. He would then have been sent to the Punitive Camp at﻿MATZKAU, near DANZIG-, or to the Concentration Camp DACHAU. If
I had reported a prisoner then he would have received twenty or twenty-five
blows with a stick and if it had been discovered that I had not reported
a prisoner who had stolen something then I would myself have been taken
to a Concentration Camp. Once at DORA I was warned by the SD that I
would come into the Camp together with the prisoners if I continued oO.
meet out preferential treatment to the prisoners. I accepted this risK
because I felt more favourably inclined towards some of the prisoners than
I did towards the German soldiers. I did not^ say yesterday that I n v;
beaten prisoners since I do not regard the boxing of ears as oeating.
Those prisoners whom I have beaten only got one blow from me with the open
hand.-'’ Except for the three shots I fired into the air at BELSEN I never
used my pistol.	I was annoyed if the prisoners had stolen something from
the Magzine, but I never hit a prisoner hard enough tor him ^o fall on ,o ^he
ground or to bleed. I always knew what I was doing.

Deposition on oath of Martha Anna LINKS female of PEIEDEBEHG-/ISSHG-EBIRGE SILISIA
sworn before Pranlc Peter CAOLA, Major EA, of No. 1 War Crimes Investigating Team
at FALLINGBOSTEL on this 25th day of January 1946.
1.	I oh bin am 27.1.1922 in F HI EDE BEBC/lSEEGE BIEGE SCHLESIM, Wiedeuuthstr. 2
geboren. Ich bin ledig und habe die reichsdeutsohe Staatsangehoerigkeit. I» Jahr
1954 trat ich freiwillig dem B.D.M. bei, dom ich bis 1959 angehoerte.
2.	Eom September 1959 zum August 1944 war ich als Arbeiterin in der Tex-
tilindustrie taetig, sit einer Uhterbreckung von 6 Monaten, ws.ehrend der ich
meiner Arbeitsdienstpflicht genuegte.
5. Am 16. Augiist 1944 vrurde ich zui’ SS als Aufseherin eingezogen, Ich kata zur
Einkleidung fuer einen Tag zu dem Eonzentrationslager GSOSS-.ROSEN und. erhielt
anschliessend eine viervroecbentliche Ausbildunr in dem Arbeitslager LANGENBILAU}
wo ich bis zum 14. September 19^1-4 verblieb.
4.	Die Ausbildung in LANGENBILAU bestand in theoretisohem Unterricht, der von^
SS-Offizieresr. abgehalten wurde und in den die Behandlung der Gefangenen gelehrt
wurde. Das Hauptsaechlichste,an das ich laich noch erinnere xrsx, dass es verboten
war die Gefangcuen zu schlagen und dass bei irgendwelohen Schwierigkeiten mit
denselben Meldung an den Lagerkonraandanten zu erstatten sei.
5.	.ir batten ausserden auch praktische Ausbildung in LANGENBILAU, dass ein
Frauenlager war mit einer Belegschaft von ca, 500 - 700 Polen und Ungam. Es way
r©n keine deutsche Gefangene im dortigen Lager. Die koerperliche xeex& Verfassung
der Gefangenen sowie die Lebens- und Arbeitsbedingungen derselben waren gut. Das
Lager nachte auch sonst einen sauberen und ordentlichen Eindruck. Ich konnte
waehrend meiner Anwesenheit einjiial feststellen, wi@ eineKomiaandofuehrerin eine
Gefangene schlug, Ich selbst schlug niemals,
6.	Am 15. September 1944 kau ich als Aufseherin zu dem an die Fima Hermann
TAICHGRABEN in ROEKRSDOEF/SCKL1SIEN angeschlossenen Arbeitslager, das auf dem
dortigen Fabrikgelaend® untergebracht war und eine Belegstaerke von 147 polni-
schen Juedinnen aufwies. Ich hatte daselbst ein ArbeitskoBffinando von 10 Polinnen.
Es befanden sich keine Gefangenen anderer Ns.tionalitaet in aaeinera Kommando. Ich
hatte ait weinera Ko raando nicnals die geringsten Schwierigkeiten und habe nie-
mals dort Gefangene geschlagen oder geaeldet. Ich verblieb ira dortigen Lager bis
zua 16. Februar 1945* Das Lager musste dann fluechten und am 17. Februar 1945
wurden die Gefangenen an das Arbeitslager KRATZAU/SUDETSNGAU uebergeben. Ich tat
ira dortigen Lager keinen Dienst und wurde einige Tags spaeter nach BELSEN abge-
ordnet.
7.	Am 28. Februar 1945 kam ich im Konyentrationslf'ger BELSEN air und. uebemabH
ein Arbeitskommando von 150 weiblichen russisohen Gefangenen, die eine Elaerungs-
anlage bauen saussten. Dies war das beste Arbeitskommando in BELSEN und ich hatte
dort keinerlei Schwierigkeiten mit aeinen Gefangenen. Es war mir sogar raoeglich
fuer dieselben zusaetzliches Essen zu erbalten. Ich trug bei raeinem Dienst kei-
nerlei Waffen auch keinen Stock oder Gimmiknueppel.
8.	Ich hatte mit dem Fruehappell der Gefangenen nicht zu tun. Ich suchte die
Gefangenen nie in ihrem Block auf und warf sie auch nicht a.us der Barack® he.rs.us.
7/enn ich bei der Arbeitseinteilung mein Eoswiando uebern&hm war dasselbe inrmer in

1946.
Mein Name ist Theodor WAGNER. Ich bin, geboren am, 5. 3* 19©8 in
Comuna Strunga Judetul Roman, Rumanian. Ich bin Rumanischer Natio-
nalitat und meine Muttersprache ist Rumanisch, aber ich verstehe
und spreche auch etwas Deutsch.
Im Jahre 1943 gab Kbnig Michael durch Marschajvl Antonescu den
Befehl, dass alle Volksdeutschen nach Deutschland zur Arbeit Oder
zum Militar gehen, mussten. Da mein Vater Deutscher war, flihr ich
am 27. 7. 43 mit vielen anderen in einem Sonderzug na„ch V/ien.
Dgrt wurden wir aus.sortiert und ich wurde zum Dienst mit der SS
bestimmt. Da ich damain nicht Deutsch sprach, konnte ich nichts
dagegen sagen. Ich wurde nach Oranienburg gesandt und am 3.8.43
zum Totenkopf Sturm^ann eingeteilt. Am 10. 8. 43 ging ich in Zivil-
kleidung nach Gross Rosen, wo ich die SS Uniform erhielt. iffi April
1944 wurde ich zum Sturmmann befordert.
Gross Rosen wurde idh ausgebildet und kam nach 3 Monaten nach
Buchenwald, wo ich Kraftfahrer wurde, weil ich schon frilher Pahrer
und Autoschlosser gewe.sen war. Am 11. November 1943 kam ich nach
Dora-Mittelbau zur Werksfahrbereitschaft. Ich blieb ih Dora bis
zum 4. April 1945, war zuerst Pahrer und musste Bestandteile von
verschiedenen Stadten Deutschlands holen, spater war ich dann Auto-
schlosser ebendort. Wachdienst Oder Dienst ausserhalb der Pahrbe-
reitschaft habe ich nie geaacht. Als wir Dora evakuierten, ham
ich am 8. April nach Neuengamme und von dort am 12. April 1945
naoh BSengen-Belsen. Auch dort habe ich nur beim Auto gearbeitet
und keinen ?fachdienst gemacht, war auch nie innerh&lb des Lagers.
A$ 15. April wurde ich dort von den Englandsrn gafangen genommen.﻿Dg ich ixur Zraftfahrer und Schlosser war, hatte ich nie^^fcwas
in den Haftlingslagern zu tun und habe auch niemand ^eschlagen.
Ich weiss, dass ein Befehl bestand, dass Haftlinge von SS Leuten
nicht geschlagen werden sollten, nur von Kapos und Vorarbeitern.

Die meisten Haftlinge in Dora waren Russen, dann gab as noch
Polen und etwa ein Yiertel waren Deutsche. Ausserdem gab es noch
IJaliener, Franzosen, Hollandar und Belgier. Ich weiss nicht,
welche Nationalitaten in Belsen waren.

Kbnig voe der Fahrbereitschaft einen Haftling gesc.hlagen hat.
Der Haftling, dessen Nationalit&i ich nicht kannte, hatte an-

mit einem grosser Stock. Ich weiss nicht, wie large, da ich weg-
ging. Ein Gestapo Beamter in Zivil, der zufallig hazukam, rief
Kbnig zu sich und stellte ihn zur Rede, weil er den Haftling
trotz des Verbotes geschlagen hatte. Sonst habe i-ch weder in
Dora noch in Belsen schlagen gesehen.

Ich war nicht der einzige Mann naneas Wagner. Es gab auch einen
Oberscharfuhrer Wagner in Dora und Belsen, dessen Vornamen kenne
ich aber nicht. In Dora hatte er die Wascherei unter sich und
war innerhalb des Haftlingslagers. In Belsen hatte er die SS

DEPOSITION op oath of Alfred SCHMIDT, male, of Niederlai^enau 8. Kreiss,
Habelschwart, Schlesien, Deutschland, sworn before Captain Myles LEENER '
R.A. , No.l fay Crimes,Investigation Team at SSTEHfCEGM bn January 25th.
1946. '	,	,
1«_ a iy name is Alfred SCK-lIDT. I was bom at Hemmersdorf, Kreis
Pibkenstein, Silesia on 9 Jul 1897. On 1st. April 1934 I joined the
Allgemeine SS because I was unemployed at the time and they had promised
me work and in 1938 I was promoted to the Rank of Rottenfuhrer. " On 1st.
September 1939 I was drafted into the Waffen SS as Schtttze. My unit
was the SS Guards Batallion, Buchenwald of the Totenkopf Sturrnbann.
On 1st. April 1940 I was again promoted to the rank of Rottenfuhrer.
On 1st. April 1942 I became Uhterscharfuhrer and on the 30th, January 1945
Oberscharfuhrer.
2.	Prom 1st. Sept 1939 till 23 Sept," 1943 I was at BUCHENWALD and did
sentry duties at the camp and with Commandos outside. On 24 Sept. 43 I
came to DORA MITTELBAU. I left DORA on 1st. Apr. 45 and joined the Pfizer
Grenadier A & E Batallion l§at Langenhom, near Hamburg, V/e went into
action there. On 5th. May 1945 I was discharged from this Unit and
on 15th. May I re ortod to the British aut orities at Itzehoe; they sent me
to a Pdf Gamp.
3.	I have never beaten prisoners or ill-treated them. At BlfcfflNWALD
I was only a guard and at DORA I was employed only in the Arms Arsenal
and never came into contact with the prisoners. I only entered the
Prisoners' Compound as I had to visit the joiners and place orders with them.
On such occasions I sttyed only for a short time there; The time was
checked,
4.	Every 8 days we received an extensive lecture on guard duties and
every day a short version of same. It contained the order that we must not
beat prisoners or speak to them. In case of attempted escape the prisoner
was to be warned three times if he approached the guards and to shoot only
if he was six metres behind the chain of guards.
5.	During the time I was there the prisoners at BUCHEMWALD were mostly
Germans, the remainder were Russians, Poles, Czechs, Yu oslavs, Belgians and
Dutch. I did not know the nationalities of the pri oners at Dora,
6.	At BUCHENWALD I saw frequently that prisoners were beaten by the
SS Blockleaders but I do not know their names since I witnessed such incidents
only from a distance whilst on the guard tower,
7.	In regard to the accusations made against me I can only say that I
have never beaten prisoners. I did accompany a transport of 23 prisoners from
DORA to BELSEN who had to push a cart containing their luggage but these
prisoners were never beaten and none of them died on the way. Iwas not
in charge of this transport. Scharfuhrer Dolling from the clothing department
was in charge as the people we e his prisoners. The Capo accompanying the
transport was a German political prisoner named SCHULZ from Berlin.
During a rest <£ Frenchman escaped in a wood and I together with two other
sentries searched the forest. As we could not find the Frenchman, I and
the other two guards fired into the air to impress the other prisoners.
8.	Although the name of SCHMIDT is very common I was the only SS man
with the name Alfred SCHMIDT at the Camps I mention.

Mgin Name ist Alfred SCHMIDT, ich bin geboren am 9. 7. 1897
in Hemmersdorf, Kreis Frankenstein, Schlesien. Am 1. 4. 1934 trat
ich in die AllgeMeine SS ein, weil ich arbeitslos war und mir daftir
Arbeit versprochen wurde. Im Jahre 1938 wurde ich zum Rottenfuhrer
befbrdert. Am 1 . 9. 1939 wurde ich als Schutze zur Waffen SS einge-
zogen. Meine Einheit war das SS Wachbattallien Buchenwald vom
Totenkopf Sturmbann. Am 1. $.1940 wurde ich wieder zum Rottenfuhrer
: ■	.	'	‘ "	•••'	-	••••• J '	'	K
befbrdert. Am 1. 4. 1942 wurde ich Unterscharfuhrer und am 30.1.45
Oberscharfuhrer.
Ich war in Buchenwald vom 1. 9. 1959 bis 23. 9. 1943 und habe dort
Waehdienst im Lager und auf Aussenkommandos gemacht. Am 24. 9. 43
kam ich nach Dora-Mittelbau. Dort war ich auf der Waffenkammer,
die mir unterstand. Ich verliess Dora am 1. 4. 45 und kam zum Panzer
Grenadier A.& E. Battalion 18 nach Langenhorn bei Hamburg, wo wir
im Kampf eingesetzt warden. Von di-eser Einheit wurde ich am 5. Mai
1945 entlassen und meldete mich am 13. Mai in Itzehoe bei den
englischen Behbrden, die mich in ein Gefangenenlager brachten.
Ich habe nie Haftlinge geschlagen Oder misshandelt. In Buchenwald
war ich nur Wachtposten und in Dora war ich nur auf der Vaffenkammer
und kam mit den Haftlingen nicht in Beriihrung. Tch betrat das Haft-
lingslager nur, wenn ich in die .Tischlerei -ging und Bestellungen
machte. Auch dann hatte ich immer nur einen kurzen Aufenthalt dort,
da die Zeit kontrolliert wurd'e.
A-, le 8 Tage wurde eine langere und taglich eine ktirzere Wachbeleh-
rung gegeben. Sie enthielt das Verbot, mit den Haftlingen zu sprechen
oder sie zu scjalagen. Bei Fluchtversuch musste man den Haftling
3 mal anrufen, wenn er sich der rostenkette naherte und auf ihn﻿schiessen, wenn er 6 Meter hinter der Postenkette war
D^.e Haftlinge in Buchenwald waren zu saeiner Zeit grdsstenteils
Deutsche, die ubrigen waren Itussen, Polen, Czechen, Jugoslawen,
Bglgier und Hollander. In Dora kannte ich die Zusammensetzung
der Haftlinge nicht.
In Buch,enwald sah ich des dfteren, dass Haftlinge von den S3 Block
By.hr'erri geschlagen wurden, kannte aber nicht ihre Namen, da ich
I »	•	«	-	: v.
es nur aus der Berne vom Wachtturm aus sah.
Auf die Anschuldigungen kann ich mir sagen, dass ich nie Haftlinge
geschlagen habe. Ich habe zwar einen Transport von 23 Haftlingen
■ hi
von Dora nach Belsen begleitet, die auch einen Wagen nit ihrem ^
Gepack zogen, aber auch diese Haftlinge wurden nie geschlagen und
keiner starb auf dem ?feg. Ich habe diesen Transport nicht geleitet,
sondern es war Scharfiihrer Dolling von der Bekleidungskammer, da
es seine Hhftlinge waren. Kap,o w,ar ein deutscher politischer
Haftling, najuens Schulz aus Berlin. Wahrend einer East entlief ein

ich und ein Posten je einen Schuss in die Luft ab, um die anderen

KEEIS DIEPHOLZ, GEEliiNY, sworn before Captain Myles LEHHER, Royal Artillery,
of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team at ESTEEUEGEN on January 25th 1946.
. 1.	My name is Heinz Lttder HEIDEl’LANt']'. I was bom on 25rd
April 1908 at Mariehdrebber, Kreis Diepholz, GSK-IANT. I am of German
nationality.
2.	In May 1933 I joined the Allgeraeine SS and on 5th
September 1939 I was attached to the 1st. SS Totenkopf Infan.ry Regiment.
Sly rank was Schtttze and on 1st. July I9Z1.O I was promoted to the rank of
Rottenfuhrer.
3.	,	'• •'	I received my training'at Breslau, Dachau and Heilbronn,
also at Mtlnzihgsn. On 4th March 1940 I came to a labour camp at 1EBELSBURG
near-PADERBORN. I was employed as a guard on working commandos and also
as sentry on the ward tower. At the end of May 1943 f came to BELSEN
together with the entire guard commando. I did sentiy duties there until
15th January 1945 and was then employed inside the camp as a Block-leader.
After one month, on 15th February 1945jl was sent to an active unit at the
front and for a short time X served in the 32 Reserve Bn.; I was vrounded
on 7th March 1945 at Vogelsang on the Oder, came to the hospital at Apolda,
and was taken prisoner by the British>at 2even on 24th April 1945.
4.	I admit having sometimes beaten women with the hand
whilst employed inside the BELSEN Camp as Blockleader.
5.	Prom time to time the Company Chief of the Guard Company,
Hauptsturmfuhrer MEIER, read out to me instriictions for the guards and before
he arrived Unterstur fuhrer Gustav STREESE used to do so. Amongst other
things they contained the order that we must not speak to prisoners or beat them
6.	The women I beat with the hand wer mostly Polisk,
Hungarians and Greeks who were very difficult to handle; there were also
French and Italian women under my supervision at BELSEN. At Vebelsburg
there were only men, mostly German Bibelforscher, political and criminal
prisoners and those who had been anti social. As far as I could judge
as a mere sentry,there were approximately 2/3rds German and the remainder
were Poles and Russians.
7.	I never sa SE personnel beat prisoners at lEBELSBUEG
and BELSEN, I only saw Capos and Foreman do so.
8.	I cannot admit any of the accusations made against me.
Onl; sometimes did I hit women in the face with the hand. I was alone as
Blockleader amongst six to seven thousand Tfomen and had only a female
supervisor to help me. Her name was Ursula SPOEN. My task was to^supervise
the dishing out of food and the cleanliness in the Camp; this Was difficult
as conditions generally were ver bad, due to the fact that sanitary
installations were overtaxed by the overcrowding of the Camp. In ordpr
to make my point it was necessar for me to box prisoners ears from time
to time. Prisoners who came from AUSCHWITZ to BELSEN told me repeatedly
«l8 are moved by the humane treatment afforded to us here'. At the Revier
Hut I was often told by prisoners 'Herr Blockfuhrer you are far too good'.

1	My name is Karl SCHMITT. I was bom at Unterwalcl- _
Behrungen in Bavaria on the 9th August, 1889. I arn of German mationfai y.
2.	On the 1st May, 1942, I was drafted to the Waffen SS Holding
Unit. At first I v/us a Schiitze, and after one and a half years was
promoted to the rank of Sturranann, and in &<m 1943 was promoted to the
rank of Rottenfubrer.
■7	First of all I came to Mauthausen and after initial training
lasting for only a fev/ days was employed as a Guard there. 1
with the Aussenkoramendos at Gusen and Diepoldsau. m Autumn, 1944, 1
was transferred to Bergen-Belsen, where I remained until the 10th or 12th
Anril. 1945. My department left Belsen and on the way to our new
destination I was admitted to the hospital at Munsterlager, where the
British arrested me later.
L	At Belsen I was emoloyed on duties inside several times a
week. On the other days I did telephone duties or worked with Outside
Commandos. I did the duties of a Blockfuhrer and took roll call at the
Hungarian Camp, the Schneebaura Gamp, the Polish Camp and the Duoch Ce p.
This happened between January, 1945, until the encl of March*	I

The Camp inmates under iiy supervision were of Hungarian, Hutch, English,
Polish and Czech nationalities. I have been told that the Camp inmac s
were beaten by Hauptscharfuhrer Emmerich end also by a Stumscharfuhrer,
but I have never seen anyone beaten.
With regard to the accusations made against me I have to say
that they are not true.’ I never heat anyone, although it may have
happened, that in the course of my duties I may have pushed Camp inmates
vri.th the hand. I did, however, not beat anyone in the face or wiuh a
stick at anv time. I can mention the following witnesses. Ta®

I widh to make a statement.
Accused.
The three men who identified me at the BELSEN Detention Cells are
only jealous of me and they used to be my comrades at the Camp. I have
always helped people and never beaten anyone. The British Prisoners of War
who were at MISBUEG all knew me and they can only say good things about m®.
They all knew me by the name of Borys and many have my address. . I can give
the names of civilians who worked with us, who can testify on my behali.
My only aim is to see a free Yugoslavia, not ruled by the Communists, but
by the" Democrats as symbolised by King Peter, My aim wai not to beat people
but only to help them at all times. I initiated the search against WINTER,
LIEHMANN and others who shot our people at HANNOVER-MISBURG, and I told^
BOLEK so. It appears that BOLSK is now giving evidence against me. I was
the only one to help BOLEK end FORSTKR when they had Typhus, at BELSEN after
the liberation. All their Polish friends had forsaken them and I, a
Yugoslav, helped them.

Deposition on oath of Martin Alfred SGHJiAl.ii, male, of PilUG, Sachsen
CHI. NITZEE STEASS1 No.4, sworn before Ca tain George Macpherson HEAED,
Royal Artillery , of No.l 'far Crimes Investigation Team, at HEUM'IGiil'iME
on the 26th January 1946.
1.	I am 34 years of age born on 3rd April Ibll in NIsnEEilINKSL
in Saxonia,	In June 1533 I joined the Ally!,.mine SS and belonged to
the 7th SS Standarte in ZWICKAU which was later transferred to PLAUEN.
Early in 1934 I was confirmed as SS man. In November 1939 I was drafted
to the W&ffen SS and came to the Reserve Battalion Ost at BRESLAU. Three
weeks later I was transferred to KRflKAU in Poland to the 8th SS Infantry
Regiment; I belonged to the 10th Coy. of the 3rd Battalion. In Dec raber
1939	I was promoted to die rank of Rottenfuhrer and in June 1940 to
Unterscharfuhrer. : y company was then transferred to RADOM. In October
1940	I came to KRAKAU to the HQ. Company of the SS and and Police Leaders
where I remained until June 1941. I was then promoted to
the rank of Scharfuhrer and came to the Reserve Battalion at 3PHSLAU.
2.	In July 1942 I was transferred to the WIHPSCHAj'TS VEE.ALTUNGS
HAUPTANT Department U.4. (DEUTSCHE AUSSDKSTUIC-S r.fiRKE) as electrician.
In December 1942 I was promoted to the rani: of Oberschaffuhrer. I belonged
to the 7/IETSCHASTS VEEWAL1 :U1'GS HAUPTAMT. W.4 until the 1st Hay 1945 and
was taken prisoner by the Americans at HAGSNOW/Mecklemburg on the 2nd May
1945.
3.	I worked in the following towns, LUBLIN, BlIZlir? EdAJh.U,
and my last place of work was STUTTHOF near Danzig. In these towns I
was employed on erecting and supervising electrical machinery at the works
of the DEUTSCHE AUSRUSTUNGS 1ERKS- I was at Lublin from July 42 till
December 43» Prom January 1944 until September 1944 I was at
BLIZYB and from the beginning of October 44 until December 44 ^ KRAKAU.
I then went to Berlin for a fortnight and afterwards returned to STUTTHOF.
4.	At BLIZYN I was with the DEUSCHE AUSRUSTUNGS VffiRK which in
January 44 was taken over by OST INDUSTRIE. I overhauled and partly
enlarged the eni^rj-e electrical installations there and was snployed as
works manager from May 44 until September 44. The \r&rtef manager was
HANS SEIFERT, a civilian employee who was responsible for the entire
production of the works. If SEIFERT ms not at the factory I was his
deputy. Other civilian employees were Herr METERING, who was Departmental
Factory Manager, the other managers of the different factory departments
were Unterscharfuhrers, Rottenfuhrers and a Sturmscharfuhrer. I know
Rottenfuhrer SL0T0SCH, Rottenfuhrer KSYDSN, SS Lann ULPEICH, SS man
BAUMGARTNER and also S tuna scharfuhrer ARNO USER. These Departmental
Factory Managers were changed over very frequently. We had a joiners'
section a tailoring section, weaving section, cobblers' section and
saddlers'. I had to supervise all these departments and the
Departmental Managers of the different sections were responsible to me
for the production of their sections if SEIFELT was not at the factory.
5.	The workers at the factory were prisoners from the labour
camp which was attached to the works. They were mostly Jews and
during the time I was there I had no Polish prisoner’s as workers in the
factory. These were retained at the Protective Custody Camp for duties
inside. I had a sheepdog there which had the name/ ASSO; the dog
was approx, 6 to 7 months old when I/had him. He was some., hat savage,
but otherwise quite harmless. I then trained the dog and always had a
dog whip with me which I used from time to time in order to train the
dog. It was an ordinary dog whip with a rifle sling hook for the
dog collar. The dog usually accompanied me but it happened often
that he ran away and I did not then see him for some time. I admit
that the dog jumped at people in a playful manner but I never had any
complaints from other people thffi* they had been bitten severely by the aog.
-1-﻿PAGE TWO OF TBMSLATION OF DEPOSITION OF Martin Alfred SCHRAMM.
6,	I admit having boxed the ears of 4 of 5 prisoners during
the time I was at BLIZYN-1 did so if they had stolen anything. I wxmt
into the Labour Camp practically every day because we had our stable
there and it happened often that I had to collect a horse drawn cart.
7.	I had to be very strict at the factory because I had
orders &==£-> the German Array and had to keep to the due delivery dates.
I also insisted on good and clean work and consquently save to it that
the Capos kept things in order at the factory. If any of the prisoners
had done anything wrong, and had been reported at the Labour Camp,
it is possible that such a report was made by the Capos without ray
knowledge. It was neccessary to adopt such measures since prisoners
very often stole material which they then sold outside the factory.
Such material was then missing when I made my inventory for my superiors.
8.	In regard to the whip I have to say the following. The
whip was given to me as a present by the pr is oners of the SEtdlers
section at BLIZYN. I remember an incident when the Obersturmbannfuhrer
whose n me I cannot remember, but I ,believe it was Liebehenschel, came
to BLIZYN to inspect the factory. He was in charge of the camps at
RADOM and BLIZYN and of the Concentration Camp LUBLIN. On that day
I took the Oberstumbannfuhrer through the factory,the dog followed us
and I had my dog .hip with me. The Obersturmbannfuhrer saw this and
asked me what I carried, with me. I told him that it was a dog ..nip
for my dog and was then severely reprimanded by him since it was not
permitted to carry any whips sr sticks inside the factory.
9,	\fith regard to the prisoner who had stolen socks I only
know of one incident which vras cleared up. Rottenfuhrer HEYDEN reported
to me that he suspected a foreman at the v,'savers section of having stolen
the stockings there as on that particular day part of the wool that had
been issued was missing. I thereupon wtent to the foreman and questioned
iiim. The foreman denied everything and accused one of his machine workers.
I then questioned the machine worker who could prove,.to me that he had
nothing to do with the matter. Faced with the evidence (issued wool,
uroeessed wool, and the finished article) the foreman then admitted tnat
he had stolen the stockings. Thereupon I first of all boxed the foreman's
ears then put him across a stool and gave him five or six blows with the
whip. I did so not because he had stolen the stockings but because he
had lied and accused another workman. I told him before-hand that he
was given the beating not because he had stolen the stockings, but because
he had lied and accused another co-v >rker. The oreman was then dismissed
from his post and was employed as a machine worker.
10.	My superiors fa* BERLIN told me at the beginning that I was
not entitled to carry out any punishments on . risoners but that I had to
report any raise nduct to :he responsible Labour Camp. In spite of many
cases of misconduct at the factory I never made any reports to the Labour
Camp, in order to save the prisoners from more severe punishment ohich
would probably have been handed out to them at the Camp.

LERNER R.A. of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team a.t
ESTERWEGEN on January 26th 1946..
Mein Name ist Richard Franz Gustav WINTER. Ich bin geboren am
15. 3. 1897 in Ferdinandstein, Ereis Greifenhagen in Pommern,
deutscher Nationalitat.
Aa 26. 8. 39 wurde ich zu dem Landesschutzen Battalion 5 einge-
zogen. Erst war ich Schiitze, im Jahre 1940 w\irde ich Gefreiter
und im Juli 1941 Unteroffizier.
Ich tat zuerst Wachdienst bei polnischen Kriegsgefangenen, die
bei Gross Born, Westfalenhof auf Landarbeit gingen. Im Januar
1940 kam ich ins Lazarett und kam im Sommer 1940 zum Battalion
268 nach Stargard in Pommern, wo ich wieder Wachdienst bei pol-
nischen Kriegsgefangenen tat. Im Jahre 1942'kam ich wieder ins
Lazarett und im Februar 1943 zum Battalion 261 in Mecklenburg,
wo ich franzbsische und russische Kriegsgefangene bewachte. Am
1. 8. 44 kam ich mit cca. 300 anderen Landesschiitzen nach Neuen-
gamme bei Hamburg, zu einer SS Einheit, blieb aber im Heer.
Von dort wurde ich nach einer arztlichen Untersuchung mit etwa
70 anderen nach Mi/sburg bei Hannover geschickt. Dort tat ich
Wg.chdienst im Arbeitslager und als Misburg evakuiert wurde,
M^sste ich mit 214 Kranken Haftlingen und weiteren 9 Wachleuten
zuriickbleiben. Ich brachte sie dann am 9* 4. 45 auf Lastautos
nach Belsen. Am 10. 4. ging ich von Belsen nach Neuengaame und
von dort am 16. 4. mit einem Transport von danischen und norwe-
gischen Internierten nach Eopenhagen. Ich kam nach Schleswig -
Holstein zuriick am 5. 5. und wurde nach der Kapitulation in
Husum interniert. Am 26. 6. 45 wurde ich aus der Gefangenschaft
entlassen und in Misburg am 10. 7- arre/tiert.﻿﻿2

Ich gab 2 Schusse ab und traf beide in den Rticken. Als wir zu
iiinen hinkamen, lagen beid® auf dem Gesiclit ausgestreckt am
Beden, et^a 15 Sehritt auseinander und waren tot. Ich musste
, bei den^Leieheil bleiben, wahrend Hendricks ins lager glng, um
ein Kommando voa Lager zu holen, die die L'eichen zuriicktrugen.
I|fl. Lager wurde dann ein Protokoll aufgenommen und ich musste
untersehreiben, dass ieh die zwei Haftlinge auf der Fl’ucht
erschossen hatte. Mir wurde gesagt, dass ich recht gehandelt
hatte.
End® Eebruar Oder Anfang Marz 1945 warden auf der Arbeitstelle
2 Haftlinge beim Oberfeldwebel Hendrichs angezeigt, weil sie
B^ot gestohlen hatten. Sie waren zuerst in einer anderen Gruppe,
gehbrten aber zu meinem Kommando. Am Kachmittag warden sie aus-
getauscht und mussten auf Befehl des Oberfeldwebels mit meiner
/ Hendrichs sagte mir, dass die beseitigt werden rniissben.
/rtliijbh G-ruppe mitgenen.^yicn steilte die Deiaen Haftlinge, aeren Natio-
nalitat ich nicht kannte, abseits von den anderen zur Arbeit an
einem Entwasserungsgraben. Ich sah die beiden beim Kessel und
einigen Rbhren stehen und nahm an, dass sie verschwinden wollten.
Ich legte das Gewehr an und druckte ab. Es war ein Versager,
ich lud wieder und schoss. Ich traf den einen Haftling und sah
den anderen aufspringen und davonlaufen. Ich lief ihm nach und
schoss wieder, aber verfehlte ihn. Als ich ihm welter folgte,
fand ich ihn bei einer anderen Arbeitsgruppe. Ich nahm ihn
Yon dem anderen ffachtposten, bei dem er Schutz suchte, weg und
Hess ihn vor mir herlaufen. Er fing an zu rennen und ich schoss
auf ihn von 25 Sphritt Entfernung. Ich traf ihn in den Riicken ji
und er war tot. Ich ging auf meine Arbeitstelle zurlick und fand
den anderen da nicht liegen, wo er gelegen hatte. Ich fand ihn
hinter einer Mauer sitzend und schoss auf ihn von 15 bis 20
S^hritt Entfernung. Ich traf ihn in den Riicken und habe ihn
nicht mehr angefasst. Der Oberfeldwebel kam dazu, bestimmte
4 Mann, die ihn aufhoben und wegtrugen. Er stimmte meiner Tat
zu und sie hatte keine weiteren Folgen.﻿war kein anderer Wachmann mit demselben Kamen im Lager M^ourg

in 1938 v/urdeich dam Scharfllhrer in der Allgemeinen S3.Von August 1938
bis 1939 war ich in dem Bekleidungs Lager DACHAU,und well ich von
Beruf Schneider bin habe ich dort als Zuschneider gearbeitefi,es waren
dort meistenteils Deutsche Hlftlinge als Arbeiter.
2.	Am ersten Juli 1939 wurde ich durch das Wirtschaft Verwaltungs
Hauptamt naeh Ravensbrtick in das Belcleidungs Werlc als Werkraeister der
Schneiderei versetzt.Dieses Werk gehSrte nicht zurn Konzentrationslager
aber ich hatte H&ftlinge des Lagers dort am Arbeiten.

N&hmaschienen ausgebildet es waren dort 1600 H&ftlimge dort am Arbeiten
und haben in zwei schichten gearbeitefi,ich hatte cine schicht und
Unterscharftihrer JHgeleit hatte die zweite schicht zu kontrollieren.
Der Werkleiter der Werke war Hauptsturmftthrer FRITZ OPITZ und der
^Betriebsleiter war JOSEF GRAF.Am ersten Oktober 1940 wurde ich dam
in die Waffen SS eingezogen und hatte den Dienstgrad Unterscharftihrer.
Ich hatte 800 H&ftlinge auf meiner schicht am Arbeiten,von diesen waren
300 Russen,200 Polen,150 Deutsche,100 Gzechen sowie einige Holl&nder
Belgier und Franzosen.Es haben dort nur Frauen gearbeited,die Arbeits-

uhr an bis 6 uhr morgens.
4.	Es wurden dort Uniformen und Winterbeicleidung gemaclit, icii selbst
habe immer erst jeden Artikel den wir machen mussten erst selber
ausprobiert und brauchte Sf Stunde um eine Hose feu-tig zustellen
Es wurdeb. im Durchschnitt 180 paar Hosen fertig gestellt pro Tag,und
zwar wurde das Material so geschnitten das 24 von den Sleektriseh
angetriebenen M&hmaschienen eine Hose fertig stellten. (Zum Beispiel:
Eine Maschiene machte nur die Taschen die andere rnachte nur Die aussen
sattme und so hatte jede Maschiene nur einen bestimmten teil der Hose
zu h&hen. )Der befehl wieviel Arbeit jede Schicht leisten musste Icam
von Berlin im Auftrage von SturmbamfUhrer KRUG, und ich habe dann den
Auftrag vom Werk und Betriebsleiter bekommen.

ich kein Polnisch Oder irgend eine der Sprachen verstehen komte, dieses
hat mich manchmal sehr aufgeregt mid MervBs gemacht und wem einer der
H&ftlinge etwas verkehrt gemacht hatte dam habe ich ihr eine Ohrfeige
gegeben. Ich habe ungef&lir 5 bis 6 H&ftlinge per woche geschlagen
es kam auch sehr oft vor das ich H&ftlinge gesehen hatte die bei ihren
Maschienen eingeschlafen waren,ich bin dam dort hingegangen und habe
die Frau geweekt imd ihr dam eine Ohrfeige gegeben Oder ich habe sie
an den Haaren gezogen.
6.	Ich habe sehr oft gesehen das Unterscharftihrer J&geleit die

/ IMPOSITION on oath of Wilhelm KBMPF, male, of BEIENRODE 3 Kreis
BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany sworn before Captain Myles LBENBR R.A. of
Ho.l War Crimes Investigation Team at HOME camp BERGEN-BELSM on
January 30th. 1946.
1.	My name is: Wilhelm KEMPF. I was born at SCHWERTHEIM Kreis
ALTBURG on S2.3.1909 an.! am of german nationality in spite of the
fact that I was bom on polish territory and served in the Polish
Army for two years from 1929 to 1931. I also speah polish.
2.	. On 11.3.1943 I was drafted into the S3 and came to the SB
Totenlcopfver band at ORAHIMBURG. In May 19441 was promoted to the
rank of" Sturmann and In October 1944 to ROTTENFUHHER.
3.	I received three weeks' training at Oranienburg and was/sent
‘ vi ac BUCHENWA1D tb’DORA.' I'arrived there in''September or October 1943.
I did duties there as Blockfuhrer until 4.4.1945. I then drove to
RAVENSBRUCK by diversiongtl route together with a transport of 5 - 600
prisoners. After two days/we came to an active unit of the Wehrmacht
~ near HEU HUPPIN' and my blood group tattoo marks were removed by opera-
tion by this troop. The unit became eneircMd by Russian and .American
troops and on 2.5.45 I was taken prisoner by the Americans. I was
discharged there on 9.7.1945.
4. I admit that at DORA I used to beat prisoners with the hand,
a stick or the end of a cable.
5 My instructions were,not to speak to the prisoners and if they
had done anything wrong, either to beat them right on the spot or to
take them to t^e clerk’s office. At the clerk’s office Rapportfurher
Hauptscharfuh rer BRUMM or Hauptscharfuhrer KSSTEL had the prisoners
beaten by another prisoner. At the end of 1944 Sturmbaimfuhrer FORSGMBR
gave out a new written order, that prisoners may no longer be beaten.
We had to sign this order and from that time on I only beat in excep-
tional eases.
6.	I had prisoners of different nationalities under me and also
0 beat themj t.hny yrmae French, Russians, Poles and Germans in that order.
I did not know the composition of nationalities at DORA in general.
7.	Of other S3 personnel, who used to beat often at DORA I only
know ’ ■ r the names of Rottenfulirer Richard KLAHR, Rottenfuhrer Max
KRIBNKE and Obersturmfuhrer SOIL.
8. I my self often beat prisoners, when I believed to have a reaon
for doing so. I did not, however beat them until they bled or in such
ai/ay, that they fell to the ground. No prisoner was taken to the hos-
pital as a result of beatings inflicted by me. I cannot recollect
a French prisoner clerk at Gleisbau BISSUTG. I do however remember that
the number of people dhtailed:!to carry a:'-ra:il, ’#a^. reduced by me.
9. If I beat people with the end of a cable, the number of blows
inflicted varied, depending on my mood. Sometimes I gave as many as
about 20 blows. 1 did not eari’y a stick or rubber truncheon during*
Appell, but beat prisoners with the Appell hoo^k, if they did not keep
■quit. If I took turnips of anyone, I may have beaten the prisoner in.
question. During marching too, I may have kicked one or the other of
the prisoners.

HOHNE CAMP, BERGEN - BELSEN on January 30th 1946.
Mein Name ist Wilhela KEMPF. Ich bin geboren aia 22. 3. 1909
in Schwertheia, Kreis Altburgund, deutscher Nationalitat,
obwohl ich in einem polnischen Gebiet geboren bin und 2 Jaiire
in der .polnisciien Armee diente, von 1929 bis 1931* ich. spreclie
adci*: rdlnisch.
Ag 11. 8. 43 wurde ich zur S3 eingezogen und kas zum S3 To-
tenkopfverband in Oranienburg. Im Mai 1944 wurde ich zur.
SJurramann befbrdert, ira Oktober 1944 zujr. Rottenfiihrer.
Iwh erhielt 3 Wochen Ausbildung in Oranienburg, wurde dann
iiber Buchenwald nach Dora geschickt, wo ich ia September
Oder Oktober 1943 ankam. Dort tat ich Dienst als Blockfiihrer
bis zuffi 4.4.45. Dann fuhren wir mit einea Transport von
5-600 Haftlingen auf Uawegen nach Ravensbriick. Nach 2 Sfagen
dort kaaen wir zu einer Fronteinheit der Wehrmacht bei Neu
Ruppin und meine Blutgruppen Tatowierung wurde bei der Trup-
pe herausoperiert. Die Einheit geriet in einen Kessel zv/ischen
den Russen und Amerikanern und am 2.5.45 geriet ich in
amerikanische Gefangenschaft. Dort wurde ich am 9.7.45 ent-
lassen
Ich gebe zu, in Dora Haftlinge geschlagen zu haben und zwar
mit der Hand, sit einem Stock Oder mit einem Kabelende.
Meine Instruktiom war, mit Haftlingen nicht zu sprechen und
wenn sie sich etwas zuschulden kommen liessen, sie entweder
an Ort und Stelle zu schlagen oder auf die Schreibstube zu
bringen. Dort liess dann der Rapportfiihrer Hauptscharfiihrer
Brumai oder Hauptscharfiihrer Kestel die Haftlinge von einem
anderen Haftling schlagen. Ende 1944 Earn dann vos Stursnfeann-
fiihrer Fbrschner ein neuer schriftlieher Befehl heraus, dass
haftlinge nicht mehr gcschiagen werdeh durfen. Wir hatten
diesen Befehl zu unterschreiben und von da ab habe ich nur
aehr in Ausnahmsfallen geschlagen.
Ich habe Haftlinge verschiedener Nationalitat unter mir
gehabt und auch geschlagen, Franzosen, Russen, lolen, Deut-
sche in dieser Reihenfolge. Die allgemeine Zusaamensetzung
der Nationalitaten in Dora kannte ich nicht.
Von anderen S3 Leuten, die in Dora viel geschlagen haben,
sind mir nur die Namen Rottenfiihrer Richard Klahr, Rptten-
fuhrer Max Krienke und Obersturmfilhrer Soil bekannt.
Iah selbst habe oft Haftlinge geschlagen, wenn ich glaubte,
Grund dazu zu haben, habe sie aber nicht blutig gesciilagen
oSer so, dass sie zu Boden fielen. Kein Haftling wurde in
Fplge meiner Schlage auf das Revier gebracht. An einen
franzosischen Haftlingsschreiber beim Gleisbau Biasing kann
ich saich nicht erinnern. Ich kann mich aber daran erinnern,
dass ich die Anzahl der Leute verringerte, die eine Schiene
zu tragen hatten.
Venn ich Leute mit dem Kabelende geschlagen habe, war die﻿Afizaiil der Schlage verschieden, je aack dea, wie ich^aufge-
legt war, toetrug sie bi,s zu ungefakr 20 Schlagen. BeJL
Appell kabe ich keinen Stock Oder Gumaiknlippel getraWn>
sondern kabe Haftlinge nur ait dem Appellbuck geschlagek,
wenn sie nicht ruhig waren. Wenn ick jemand Steckriiben
abnakm, mag ick den betreffenden Haftling gescklagen kaben.

1937 I was a o©)&»<3& labsurer at tke sugar factery @f the firm
Mersdarf & Hecker. Erem 1937 till 1943 I was with tke Reicksbakn
i ^ OSCHERSLEBEN as a, packer fereman. On 28tk August 1943 I was
drafted into tke Ar«y and belenged t© the 398 Stamm Kempanie of
the Grenadier Ersatz Battalien at GOSLAR, my Army number was 2591.
I was in the rank ®f Schiitze (Rifleman), ajad remained there f©r
training f©r 8 ©r 9 weeks, ajad ws.s then sent t© T0R0JIN0 in tke
P^evince of Braadejaburg.

1943 I was transferred t® KONIGSBERG f®r an ®perati@m ©js tke eye,

Januarjr 1944 I then came t© SCHWEITNITZ in Pslish Upper Selasia,
at tke end of January t© the Sudetenlamd and then t© WALDENBURG,.
Polish Upper Selssia, where I was with the Lajadesschutzem.
3.	At the beginning ©f February 1944 I came t©
AUSCHWITZ where I remained with an Army trainings Cempany till
■ the end ®f February 1945. At AUSCHWITZ I-had t© perform' guard
duties twice or three times a week at BIRKENAU, which was kjaawn
t« me as AUSCHWITZ II. In this camp wemen, children and men were
accomodated. We had to stand ©m guard for six h@urs and e©uld
then have six keurs- sleep. The following men were with me at
AUSCHWITZ: Ujatersckarfiihrer Brun® ALBRECHT, Obergefreiter MUH1E,
Hgupts'fcharfuhrer NEBB’E, Unterscharfuhrer Y/alter SCHMIDT, Ober-
gefreiter Ernst GRAF, Obergefreiter Heijarich KERN, and Umtersc]|ar-
fiikrer Franz WITTECK.
4.	The prissners at AUSCHWITZ were all very under-
nourished and were starving. Judging* by their looks a hundred
died daily ®f starvation. The people I saw there could hardly
stand ©n their leg-s any ®®re and were very wSk. I myself have
seen that every day ab®ut 20 ©r 25 pri«s@Jfters wh® had collapsed
could n®t rise again but were lying ®n the ground and later
carried ts their rooms by other prisoners. I assume that all
the 25 were dead ©n tke following day, since n© d®ct©r looked
after these pe©ple.
5.	. . Within the camp I saw 10 ©r 12 SS men run
abeut wi.tk their Cap@s. The SS men were armed with carabines and
revolvers and the cap@s with sticks. I witnessed every day k©w
these SS men hit 10 t® 15 @f the prissners with their fists till
they fell, t®, tke ground. 5 ®r 6 @f these prisoners get up again
later, the* ethers remained lying there and were later put ©n a
heap by the cerpse cemmajad®. Furthermsre I have seen hew every
day 20 t® 30 priseners were sh@t by tkp SS men with rifles. I
have very, ©ftern talked t© the SS men and have asked them, why
’ the prisoners had been skat, and the answer I get, was that the
prisoners had attempted t® escape. Many have alse been shet by
the guards, without first having been challanged. Many have als®
beeja beaten' t© death’ by the sentries, but I cannot new remember
tke names @f any ef these sentries.
6.	In March 1945 I then accompanied a transport
@f prisoners from AUSCHWITZ to the cencentration camp of BERGEN-
BELSEN as a sentry. There were men and women,antvthe prisoners
were leaded 80 t® each truck. The trucks were @pem and covered﻿c©»tijaued. SHEET TWO	.	,

BUGHEHWA1D we were attacked by low flying aircraft and about 25
bombs were drsppen by 10 t© 20 planes. I was riding in ©ne ©f
the ©pen cattle trucks and in my truck tkree wemen were killed
by a sleeper whicia kad been thr®wn up int® the air by tke blast
®f ©ne.bsmb and landed in my truck. Apart fr®*a that n»-@ne was
injured., A furt|iep 4Q prisoners were killed and tw® SS men wk®se
names I d© not know. B@ffl.bs were als© droppen in tke men's camp
®f BUCHENWA1D concentration camp. The dead women were left lying
in the trucks and taken along t@ BELSEN.
7.	.The journey fr©ia AUSCHWITZ t© BERGEH-BELSEN
tsok 6 to 7 days and tke train ®nly stepped at tkree stations,
and these three times were the ©nly ®ccapi@ns vvhen the prisoners
gsi? anything to drink and were permitted to leave the trucrks in
©rder to relieve themseves. Rain and snew which they caught during
the jcurney. was the only ether means ef drinking they had. Each
prissner was issued,with a complete loaf and butter as a day's
ratisr;.	-..1
8.	We arrived at BELSEN at the end of March 1945.
T^.e dead women were collected at the station by c, car and. brought
to Concentration camp BERGEN- BILLS BN N©.1. All other nr is oners
ireh to the espp:. I was then transferred to the S3 and a
p^elonged to the guards of concentration camp BERGEN- BELSEN in

9.	My task was t© go to the station at BERGEN V
every morning with 50 prisoners and to unload rations froja goods
trucks. We left camp at 8 o'clock in the morning and worked till
6 ©'clock at night. The pris®n.prs were of all nationalities. I
remember an incident, whin a prisoner ,kad stolen flour and was caught
by a Gap®, ike 'Cap© was e German from. BERLIN. The Gap© hit the
prisoner se hard, that the prissner fell int© a, ditch with water,
and had to be taken back t© camp ,by car, I d© net know the name

10.	On 15th April 1945 I, was in Camp 1 and taken

dead. On 21st April 1945 I caught typhus and was taken to the

4.	Die HEftlinge in Ahschwitz waren aide sehr unterernaiirt
und waren am verhungern,dem aussehen der haftlinge nach sind dorc
jeden Tag 100 haftlinge dem Hungerstode erlegen ,die Leute die ich
gesehen habe konnten kaum noch auf den Beinen stehen und waren sehr
schwaeh.Ich selbst habe gesehen das jeden Tag ungefShr 20 bis 25
HSftlina-e die umgefallen waren nieht wieder aufstanden sondern am
boden liegen blieben und dann von anderen haft linger, aufgehoben wurden
und in ihre Tinterkunftsratime gebraeht wurden und ich nehme an das aide
_p5 dann am nachsten tage tod vraren weil sich kein Arzt um diese Leute
"dimmerte.
5.	Innerhalb des Lagers habe ich jeden tag 10 bis 12 S3 Manner
mit ihren Kano’s herumlaufen sehen,die SS Manner waren mit Karabinern
und Pistolen"bewaffnet und die Kapo's mit StiJcken, ich war dann jeden
Tag zeuge diese S3 Leute und Kapo’s 10,bis 15 Haftlinge mit der Faust
zu Boden geschlagen haben,5 oder 6 von diesen Haftlingen sind dann
wieder aufgestanden und die anderen blieben am Boden liegen und wurden
dann spgter von dem Leichenkommando auf einen Haufen zusammen gelegt.
Ausserdem habe ich gesehen das 20 bis dreissig Haftlinge pro tag von
den S3 Ma"nnern im Lager erschossen wurden mit gewehren,ich habe sehr
oft mit diesen S3 MMimern gespr ochen mid habe sie gefragt warum die
Haftlinge erschossen wurden mid bekam dann zur antwort das die Haftlinge
versucht hatten und das sie flttchten wollten,es sind aber auch viele
Haftlinge vo^i der Wac-h mannschaft erschossen worden ohne erst den befehl
Halt srTbekommen viele sind aber auch von den Poaten zu Tode geschlagen
worden aber ich kann mich nicht auf irgehdv/elche namen der Posten
entsifmen.
6.	In MMrz 1945 habe ich dann als Wachmann einen Transport
mit Haftlingen von Auschwitz nach dem Konzentrations Lager Bergen-
Belsen begleitefi.Es waren Manner,Frauen und die haftlinge wurden zu
80 haftlinge per wagen eingeladen. Die wagen waren offene Viehwagen
manche waren auch geschlossen,der Zug war 50 Wagen lang mit je zwei﻿Deposition on oath of HHRMMH I,Idler,

Wachposten zinn Wagen.Die Manner von diesem transport-teamen nach
dem Konzentrationslager BUOHENWALD.' WSrend ujiseres aufenthaltes in
BU0HE1TWALD auf dem Bahnhof batten wir einen Tiefflieger ahferif’f,es
fielen imgefShr 25 Bomben die von 10 bis 20 Fliegern abgev/orfen warden*
Ich.habe auf einen dor offenen Viehwagen mitfahren mtlssen,in diesem
Wagen warden 3 Frauen dur ch 'eine Bahnschwelle die von der explosion
einer Bombe in die Luft gesclileudert war und in meinern wagen landete
getSted aber sonst feeiner verwdndet,ausserdem; sind noch 40 andere
Hdftlinge von-' den Bomben getBted worden sowie 2 SS MMnner lessen narnen
ich nicht kenne,es fielen aber auch Bomben in das M&merlager des
Konzentrationslagers Buchenwald,die Toten Frauen wurden in den einzelnen
Wagen liegen gelassen mid kamen mit nach Belsen.
7.	Die Fahrt von Auschwitz nach Bergen -Belsen dauerte 6 bis 7 Tage
mid der Zug Melt nur an drei Stationen an, cplese drei rnal waren die
einzigsten tage das die Haftlinge etwas zu trinken bekornmen haben und
das sie erlaubt waren von dem wagen herunter zu kommen um austreten
zu kijnnen. Jegliehes andere trinkmaterial welches die Haftlinge hattsn
war das Regenwasser oder der Sclmee den sie wMhrend der Fahrt aufgefangen
hatten. Jeder Mftling bekam ein ganzes Brot und Butter als eine Tages
Ration.
8.	Ende hMbz 1945 kamen wir in Belsen an,die Toten Frauen wurden
• dort vom Bahiihof mit einem Aiito abgeholt und zum Konzentrationslager
WBergen Bclsen No:l.gebracht.Alle anderen Haftlinge mussten zwa Lager
marschieren.Ich bin dann in die S3 eingegliedert worden und gehdrte
zur ?/achmannschaft des Konzentrationslager Bergen Belsen im Dienstgrade
eines Schtltzen.
9.	Heine Aufgabe war das ich jeden morgen mit 50 HSftlingen des
Lagers nach dem Balmhof in Bergen ging um dort Verpfleggng von den
Gttterwagen a^zuladen.Wir verliessen das Lager ym 8 Uhr morgends und
arbeiteten bis um IS Uhr abends.Die Haftlinge waren von alien
National!taten. Ich erinnere mich an einen Vorfall wenn ein Haftling
Mehl gestohlen hatte und dabei,von einem Kapo erwischt worden war,
Der Kapo war ein Deutscher von Berlin.Der Kapo hat den HMftling so
hart geschlageh dass der Haftling in einen G-raben mit wasser fiel und
musste dann abends mit dem Auteo nach dem Lager zurilck gebracht werden.
Ich weiss nicht wie der Kapo heisst.
10.	Am 15.Aoril 1945 war ich im Lager 1. und wurde dort gefangen
^gehalten,habe aber nicht mithelfen rniissen bei der Beerdigung der Toten.
21 April 1945 bekam ich Fleckfieber mid wurde nach Hamburg-Wandsbek
in das Hosoital eingeliefert,dort habe ich vier wochen gelegen und
kam dann erst in ein anderes Hospital lessen namen ich vergessen habe
Von dort kam ich dann nach LANG-ENHORN bei Hamburg in ein Lazarett mid
wurde am 18 Juni 1945 nach NEIJENG-AMME gebracht.In NEUENGAMlffil habe'ich
die von mir in paragraph 3 angegebenen S3 Manner gesehen,diese waren
alle mit mir zusammen in Auschwitz und Belsen.

Inrestigatian iv-«un at	this a^th ' ay of January 194-6.
1.	X waa born on. th® Z^isi Julyijl921, at iiaiiSIH
N fv9, I am single anxl ©f G' rsian nationality. My parents live ta the
y? beat of ay knowledge at flc.-nilN N 58, Sohliemannstrsiase 8. I have
never been a somber ef the N. :hD. A.F. the B,D.M. er any • similar ez^anisatieru
2.	:jurin;/ the time from September 1939 t®
October 1942 I was norking as a aachirv^ist with the firm HEIflKELS at
liPCiU!. In October 3.94-2 I was transferred, from there to the 3S as a
Bupcrvisor.
PHQDUCTXOff KO.


3.	J?jr first job ••./as at ti e Csncentratian Oanagc
MTT-lfSdHHCiK where I ms introduced to the duties which I ah >uld haw ts
perfmaa by the SB Oberavfceherin LANG- P>l-D who was doing duty there.
I -sms infomea, that any .kind of personal interosurse with prisoners
was not pemitt® , that it was not persiitti d to beat and tiiafc in case
©f any shert-c ;Aj.g3 a written report about the prisoner had t® be
mad® in order to have her punished. My first practical dutp- was the
Labacr Kiwmando Furrisro rAiich was working in the area of the Camp.
I ®mpl yed hex® 200 Gareian and Polish v.-omen in the day shift and 100 ta
150 duringtl|® night shift. The conditions under which the prisoners
were then/working at KAViitJSldXJK uer - not tae^bad. Pocu was suiTicient.
The prisoners worked well and to -he beat of ay satisfactien. I had
na trouble at ail with iry Koi'.wmnuo. I iiave in tills camp never beaten
a prisoner ®r ill-treated hex- otherwise n@r fsave 1 ever heard or seen
that this was don® qy anyone else. I was at the Camp at HAVENSBBtCK
from October 1942 until March 194-3.
4-.	*	In .-ku'oh 1943 the •SoM.-.siuaarti.t iJAVJiNS ■ . JCK
caused ms to be tranafe.ruod to the 0 ncentrution Cetup at LOMJUWiAlBAHECK
by way «f punishment. In this Camp I reBained until Apx’il 1944.
Hera I was solely employed in the prisoners and 83 kitchen® I was
supervisor of the prisoners kitchen until December 1943 and then took
over the S3 kitchen which I kept until April 1944. In both cases I
was in charge of 50 t@ 50 Polish Jewesses, Russian and Genewri prisoners.
About the Camp of MAILANICK I can only say that although I have heard
about the g&s-okambera and their victims there, I have never seen than
or even had anything to do with the®. The food ©f the prisoners was
not bad. 1 syself did not have a lot of tro ble v.dth the priseners
and was only soui times forced to intarren®. Here and there I iiad t©
box a prisoners ears:, I however only used sy hands on those occasions
and never seriously hurt aqyons. I have never bo«n a witnsss or have
heard that in this Camp beatings were administerred.
5.	When MAIDAF&CK was disbanded I came in
April 1944 t® the Ouncentraiion Camp KRAKAU-PILA3CH0W. I was in charge
hvre ef an outside Komnand© of a 100 Polish and Hunga- lan Jewesses,
wh© had to sort tools of the Luftwaffe, I had no difficulties with
this. Ksmmaftd© and there was n® need to beat them. I have at this Camp
once seen hew the Oberaffceherin thrashed a prisoner with her hantis,
apart from this I have not noted any ;:pecial incidents. I remained in
this Gasp until it was disbanded in Septeuber 1944.
6.	FollefcrlttE this I caste t® eh® Concentration
Ca/ap AU . WITZ for a month. Here I had ta supsrrise two Palish women﻿PACK 7m OF Tmt-LATIO* OP	ap Gertrud . .1IA HSISE,
who xmz* Aping horfclcult t«1 work in the Owwihflanta gardan. These
ir.ro prisoners	well ©ff and I never had aivy tro bla with thc«
and there was no need to beat than* Oenditiona on the uholae at
ABSCHSITZ were bad. 1 • •yyel* had no fcro bla during r®H call and
haw never beaten anyone on this 'occasion. I Iiave never stood outside
the cajnp and beaten prisoners from: Labo r Koswaandos with a rubber
truncheon. I have not been m duty in the kitchen at AUSOffiVITZ.
I d© not ioiow a "Blo-rk ex'1 Death” or Block number 25 in that Camp.
7,	In October 1944 I x-»as transferred frasa
A0SC1?V?ITZ to the Concentration Camp at HKJSN&AiBiJS and x-emined, in the
C&Mp until 4th April 1945 with the exception of the time when I ms,
ill. I did not.do any duty between 12tk December 1944 and 21st March
194-5 in that Camp.	(X was put <«t the sick list on 12 h December 1944
and arrived cm Jrd January 1945 at the hospital Sitl&bSM&SStS!, where I
remined until 28th Pebruaxy 1945 with an inflammation af ti* appendicitis.
I then came back t© ;xy old camp 03SKH IDS and was 10 days off duty and
straight after that 1 was granted leave until 21st March 1945)•	In
OBdKnsiISS .iicii was one ©f the yut-lying Camps of KSttaNGAlDiS, I had the
job of a Kamsaittlo leader and v.&a responsible for cleanliness, good older,
anei the mintenanc® of disipline in the Camp. I :iave her© found it
neooe&axy to beat pidsonera soKoti-'ios, who t.culd net subordinate.
I iiave hsHavar alvttjys usud Ijmda an© never used a stick or mbbar
tronchson. Nei.-.or . ave I ever beaten with ay bait or Kicked prisoners*
Thase prisoners who were beaten by me did not sustain injury of any kind.
8.	On 4th April 1945 the Camp at 0B23HEIDI was
disbanded and ti.e prisoi.ere transferred to	Cencentratien Camp.
I syaelf did not perfona any duties at USDSHf and returned shortly^
afterw irdat to KHEKhCiMMS froa whsnt I was sent to the Casjp UDiihZ'LAI^
Hera I remained for oxa, . .	.0 day and was then dismissed. I ©-aoaped
from there to H,jli30HCr whc ixe on 11th June 1945 I was arrested by British
Military Police.
9,	I admit to have beaten prisoners at the
named camps under ;he above mentioned circumstances. I have al. ays
don® s© with my hand and never with any instrument and 1 have never
kick©'’ pri -oners. I ave never hcaw an Oberaufseherin. I have never
had anything to d© v/ith st lecting pri‘.oners for the gas-chambers.
I iiav®, with th® exception ®f the tin© mentioned, never been to the
Concentration Camp RAYIHSaSlCK. My presence at 0BSHHE1DS as well as
the period of sy illness canebe verified by the fomer supervisors Anita
SCHHEID1R and Wilma TffiMOTH who ars like-eri.se at NEOHUHoTEB,

attacked t® Ne.l War Crimes Investigatiaa Tea® at NEUMON^jpUi •&
this 30tk day ®f January 1946.
1.	I was b®rn at ESSEN ©n 3rd May 1893» I a«
•f German nationality, married, and have tw® children. I joined
the NSDAP in 1937. I was at that tiae Oberscharfuhrer in the
civilian SS.
2.	Is September 1939 I was drafted as Oberschar-
fuhrer ©f the WaffenSS t® the ccncestratien camp MAUTHAUSEN. I was
a Zugfiihrer there and in charge ®f training ®f y«ung recruits. I
had nothing t® d© with the priseners at the camp, my duties were
®f a purely military nature. I can give m© inferaation about the
c&«p, si;ce 1 had n© c©nnecti©n whatsoever with it. I carried ©ut
that® duties fer the whole ti®e ©f ®y presence there, till March
1943* In passing I have seen that seaetiwes eosmada leaders aadCapos
beat prisemers. I myself have never beaten a prisoner there. Fr**
Mgrch 1943 till May 1943 I performed duties at the labeur caap
HINZERT, HUNDSRUCK near TRIER. There to® I was a Zugftihrer and had
nothing t® d© with the camps. With regard t© treatment and feeding
of prisoners, this camp was g«@d. I have never beaten there Byself
®.©r seen anybody else beating.
3.	In May 1943 I was transferred t© the Civilian
Internaant Camp at BERGEN, where I re-ained till August 1944. Here,
tco, I had nothing t© do with the prisoners, and can say nothing
t© the disadvantage of this camp.
4.	In August 1944 I t©©k ever the labour camp
HAMBUHREN-WALDESTLUST as cemand® leader. The strength of the C8«p
there was 400 Polish and German Jewesses. I was responsible f@r
employment, guards, and the general treatment in the camp. The pri-
soners were treated very humanely and had a geed life with me. The
employment consisted clearing ©f bombed sites. The feed was good.
With t.;e exception ©f ®ecasi®n boxing ©f ears, there was n© beating
in the camp. I f|s®®e®ne behaved badly, the punishment consisted
merely in a reducion ®f f©©d, Ihave never beaten properly in the
camp. In ?/ALDESLUSX I had t© beat however semetimes and in d®ing
s® used my hands, a stick ®r a piece ©f rubber tubing, ©r I kicked,
I never used a proper rubber truncheon. I hit the prisoners in the
face, on their backs ©r buttocks. I merely beat the prisoners t®
avoid having t© rep@rt them, in wkMh case they would have bean sent
t® BELSEN. I beat ©r put them on half rations. These beaten by me
have never suffered injuries of any nature. It sight just be possible
that a prisoner was bleeding a little. In December 1944 it was re-
ported t® me, that one ©f the prisoners^as corresponding with a
Frenchman. To avoid reporting this, I -be«i ner with the piece of
rubber tubing and kicked her. It is possible, that she was bleeding.
I beat her @n the body and in the face. IxhnjnsxsisJixEHanyxxhsnxf
?0iLaxKXE±iHi:£x*kxM«XBxhxiEkx3dExmxpxiB®BHKjcxwiihs]aix±K$KE±iig She was
not taken t© hospital, but re-appeared f©r work the following mor-
ning. I have als© ©nee, when I was excited thrown s brick at a pri-
soner, without causing any harm t© her. This prisoner had hysteric
fits, and had to be taken to hospital for a few days. I am quite
certain that she did not g® t® hospital, because of any injuries.
I threw the stone, because she hod been insubordinate. I had t©ld
the Lagnraelteste to keep order and if it was necessary just to give
beatings. I can only remember beating her ®noe and sometimes I
tried @ut the rubber tubing ©n her in the guard r©©m. Further special
incidents in ray camp have not c©me t® ®y knowledge.﻿5.
In February 1945 I delivered Ky prisoners at «.
the C®eentratJ.sn Osunp BEL M and took over the Labour Control
until tile middle ®f April 1945. The conditions in this Ca.p .	-
t;ere dewas ;ating. I have seen htw sentries and Ca^ os boat prioeners
th®r®j«n4 ayself^’d-th the exceptim of', boxing a tm prisoners ears* - f
have not actesinisterred any beatings. I reae«ber horr once*to
save a Eussian transport fran 1 ting^mving to fire iqy pistol into
th© air* I have never shot at a prisoner there. To break up
the oiowd I stepped into them and hit into than with the rubber tubing.
I have on this occasion net severely injured nor e on ld.iled any
prisoners. I cannot think of wy further escoept.ojml incidents where
I tm said to nav® beaten or ill-treated .. risen rs.
6.	with the exception of in th© above mentioned
circuKstanoes I have never baaten prisonors, ill-treated then or
evon shat them. Those who have been beaten bgr sa# haves never
sxjffered serious injury* There ms in th© Csieps uhfjre I have bean
stationed n© other person of the same name.

of
OhristllTS STRAUSS
Deposition- on oath of Christine •■STRAUS'S, female, of'BLEIBERG-
Obervillaeh :'J.rnten, sworn before 2/Lt. P.G. . G-LASS, JA0 Staff
Pool, attached i!o. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team, at NETJiri1STER
on-30th January 1946.
1.	I was' born on the 28th August 1906 at EAIBL, K8ENTM.
I am- single and have one child. My nationality is Austrian. I
have never been a member of the HBDAP or any of its eub formations.
2.	Prom September 1939 to August 1942 I was in MILAN, Italy,’
°as representative of an Italian Fashion shop. Fro& August 1942
until October 1942 I remained at the house of my parents. In
October 1943 I was conscripted as interpreter (G-erman-Italian)
to the munitions factory GH. G. D.
I remained until October 1944.
at D3MHZ on the ELBE, where
3.	In October 1944 I was drafted into the S3 as a
supervisor. To start with I came for six days, to the Concentration
; - Camp JIE'FNGAIfvlS where I was fitted out and given instructions of
ho?/ to treat prisoners. It was said that it was forbidden to
beat, that punishment of prisoners could only follow at the order
of the Commandant, that order was to prevail within the Gamp,
that a clean roll call had to take place, and that any kind of
personal intercourse with .prisoners was forbidden.
4.	I was then transferred to the Camp EIDELSTEDT, where
I remained until the 11th May 1945 when I was arrested by British
troops. I have been in this Gamp continuously•with an
^inteiiaiption of six weeks^I from the end of Marfh 45 to the 30th
April 1945) when I was ini Hospital of Trbpiqal Diseases at HAMBURG
"'owing to Malaria. The strength of the Camp was approximately
5Q0 .prisoners. They were Hungarian, Czechs, Austrian and German
Jewesses. " The Camp Commandant was S3 Unterscharfuhrer KilMMEL.
( My first task at the Camp was that of a kitchen supervisor where I
was in charge of the kitchen personnel consisting of 13 prisoners.
(Ten Hungarians, two Czechs, one German) This post I held until
January 1945. Furthermore I was in control of the Sickbay of the
Gamp during this period. I have never administered tablets or
any other kind of medicine in the Sickbay. This was the task
of the prisoner doctor and prisoner nurses who worked there. I
do know however, that KUMMEL interfered with matters at the Sickbay
and gave instructions quite according to his liking. I furthermore
remember that during my presence at the Gamp two children were born
at the hospital. The first, the birth I believe took place at
the end of November 1944, was stillborn. It was a boy. I was
myself present at the birth (I330hrs.). KttMMEL only arrived
later. It is true that 1 was very excited about it and came to
the Camp kitchen together with IpMMEL in an excited condition in
order to wash myself. I told the prisoners straight away that the
child had been stillborn. The second birth occurred in the night
from the 21st to 22nd December 1944. I was at this time not present
-or at the Sickbay, but I was called by^sentry and went to the Sickbay
' straight away, where I found KilMMEL the prisoner doctor and nurses.
HUMMEL told me that the child was dead and pointed feo a bundle
which was wrapped up in a blanket. I convinced myself, that the
bundle contained the body of the dead new born boy. How the birth
itself took place I do not know since I arrived late at the Sickbay.
Whether and in ho?/ much HUMMEL is to blame for the death of the
child X conseguently caniigt say. I do know that HUMMEL beat
“s oruxaiJ-y with his hands.	On one occasion I stepped
prisoner﻿«
forv/ard to protect a prisoner ojid KUI.IMSL v/ho thrashed out
at the same moment, thus Icnocu-i'*©*'out tv/o of my front teeth.
It is furthermore my opinion whicn however I cannot prove,
that KUMMEL conmitted genual.offences against prisoners.
I often had differences of opinion with Kffi.lMEL with regard
to treatment of prisoners as a final result of which he
yp relieved me of my post and sent me on anoutside homrnando.
4.	This kommando on which 1 I’emained until the end
consisted of 75 Hungarian, Czech and German prisoners and was
employed clearing Tootahed sites at HAKIBUROr. 1 never nad, any
difficulties with my Icommando and got along well with my
With the exception of Klt.IHSL I have never seen
^anyone administering heatings in the Camp and no. other
exceptional incidents in the Camp have come to myknowledge.
5.	There was no other supervisor with my name at
the Camp 3ISELSTEDT during my period of duty.there.

1.	i was bom on the 18th June lf91 in SOIE.iSHB’IILD/NIEDifiSLAUSITZ.
I am married and have three children. My nationality is German. I
became a member of the N.S.P. A. P. party 1933.
'	?	'	'	■	.oho	* •
2.	Prom September 1939 until the-27th April 1944 I was . secretary
of the Tax Payers Committee!in DANZIB. On 28th April 1944- I was called up
to the Landesschutzenersatzbataillon 2 in STETTIN as Serjeant. I stayed
there until 7th July 1944.
3.	4	On'8th July 1944 I was posted to the SS 'Wachbataillon at
tbe Concentration Camp STUTTHOF near DANZIG and promoted to SS Oberscharfuhrer
In this Cam, I had nothing to do with the prisoners. My work there consisted
ef riving drill exer-cise.
4. ’	Towards the end of July 1944 I wan sent to the Concentration
Camp BUCHS'IWALD in Saxony. For two days I did no work in this Camp. I
received orders to move to BttHLBN near LEIPZIG as Aussenkomuando, where I
stayed until 20th August 1944. My service there was as section leader.
The section consisted of 50 Italians, Frenchmen, Russians, Latvians and
EsthoMans and Germans. . .This section was detailed to do clearing and
gardening work by the firm BRABAG. I never had any difficulties with my
section, consequently I never had to put in a bad report. Besides my
ser ice weapon I carried a carbine. Such weapons as rubber truncheons, and
sticks, I never used. I have never beaten a prisoner. On the 20th
August 1944 I arrived at the Convalescent Home at AL32RTSBERG in VOGTL,
because I was suspected of having tubercolosis. I stayed there until
the 13th October 1944 at this Convalescent Home. From here I returned to
Eiy old section and stayed there until the beginning of November 1944.
I was sent via BUCIEENWALD (without doing any service there) to STUTTHOF
where I arrived on the 10th November 1944.
5.	From there I came to the outside kommando at ELBING, where
I took over the control of the guards and ..orkerfe. The Camp consisted
of 1700 prisoners of the following nationalities, Russians, Poles, Esthonians,
Lithuanians, French, Latvians, Italians and German. The Camp was very-
clean and the food situation was good. I have never seen a prisoner beaten
or beaten one myself. I stayed in this Camp until 20th January 1945 and
was then sent back to STUTTHOF. Immediately I received orders to march to
LAUENBURG in P0MKERN with 1270 prisoners of the said nationalities. Without
incident I reached LAUENBURG after 7 days and handed over the prisoners.
I was then sent to the hospital in LAUENBURG suffering from diarrhoea where
I stayed until 20th February and then was transferred to an hospital in
RUGENWALDE. Towards the end of February 1945 I was transferred from there
to the hospital at HELAHEIDE where I arrived on 1st March 1945, and stayed
until 31st March 1945.	Then I arrived at the Genesendenkompanie HEM
in HELA. I retijrned to the Concentration Camp at 0RARIFNBURG on the 11th
April 1945 where I, as I was not fit for service, stayed for three days
waiting for transportation. Then the whole Camp marched in the direction
of MECKLBG. I marched as a sick patient with the Camp and did not have
charge of any prisoners. On 4-th May 194-5 I was taken prisoner by the
Americans,
<n SS
6.	f.<5>. 1 have never done service in Concentration Camps outside of﻿time I have mentioned above. Between 1938 and 1942 I was not in the
4
Concentration Camps. In 33UOHE1.71ALD I have never beaten prisoners with
my bare hands or rubber truncheon, or sticks, also I have never kicked
any prisoners.

1.	Ich bin am 18.6.1891 in SOMMERFELD/NIEDERLAUSITZ. geboren.
Ich bin verheiratet und habe 3 Kinder. Meine Nationalitat ist
Reiehsdeutscher. Ich wurde im Marz 1933 Mitglied der N.S.D.A.P.
2.	Vom September 1939 bis zum 27. April 1944 war ich als Steu-
ersekretar beim Finanzamt I in DANZIG beschaftigt. Am+28. April
1944 wurde ich als Feldwebel zum Landesschutzenersatzbataillon 2
nach STETTIN	eingezogen und verblieb dort bis zum 7. Juli
1®44.
3.	Am 8. Juli 1944 wurde ich zum SS-Wachbataillon zum Konzentra-
tionslager STUTTHOF bei DANZIG versetzt und rangmassig als SS-Ober-
scharflihrer eingestellt. Ich hatte im dortigen Lager keinen Dienst
^te&Ane-n--D±enst mit Gefangenen zu versehen. Meine Beschaftigung dort

4.	Gegen Ende Juli 1944 wurde ich zum Konzentrationlager BUCHEN-
WALD in SACHSEN versetzt. Im dortigen Lager verblieb ich lediglich
2 Tage ohne Dienst zu tun. Ich erhielt sodann meine Versetzung zum
Aussenkommando BOHLEN bei LEIPZIG, wo ich bis ca. 20. August 1944
verblieb.. Ich tat dort Dienst als Postenfuhrer mit einem Kommando
von ca. 50 Italienern, Franzosen, Russen, Letten, Esten und Deutsche]
Das Kommando wurde zu Erd- und Aufraumungsarbeiten bei der Firma
BRABAG eingesetzt. Ich hatte mit meinem Kommando niemals Schwierig-
keiten und infolgedessen auch keine Veranlassung zu Klagen.
Ich trug ausser meiner Dienstwaffe, einen Karabiner, keinerlei weite-

Deposition on oath of Walter Friedrich Y/ilhelm QUAKERNACK, male, of
SENNS II No. 367, Kreis BIELEFELD, sworn before Captain George
Macpherson HEARD, Royal Artillery, of No.l Y/ar Crimes Investigation
Team at HSMBR near ISEELOHN on 5th February 1946.
1.	yiy name is Walter Friedrich Wilhelm QUAKERNAEK. I was
born on 9th Juiby 1907 in SENILE II near BIELEFELD, and am of German
nationality. In May 1933 I joined the general S3 in SENNE. In
1931 I had joioft^he National Socialist Party. In the general
SS I was promoted to the rank of Scharfuhrer. In January 1940 I
was called up into the V/affen S3 as Schutze but by February 1943 I
had been promoted to the rank of Oberscharfuhrer.
2.	I received my training in BRNO. I left BRNO in May 1940
and was posted to No.5 Deaths Head Regiment in ORANIENBURG where 1
was a Spiess in the rank of a Rottenfi hrer of a Convalescent Depot.
In October or November 1940 I was posted to the Guard Company at
AUSCHWITZ. There I was employed in the office, in the same rank.
Then I did guard duties for a few weeks and was later on posted to
the Ko»mandantur where I worked for the political Department. There
I was promoted to Unterscharfuhrer but at the beginning of December
1943 I was sent to hospital and had, later on, to report for a transfer
to Camp M0N0WITZ. From there I was posted in February or March 1944
to LAURAHOTTE where I was Camp Commandant. In January 1945 I left
LAURAHUTTE with a transport of prisoners which went to MAUTHAUSEN.
I left MAUTHAUSEN in Februaiy 1945 with a transport of 500 prisoners
which I had to take to HANOMAG near HAMOVER. There I stopped until
the beginning of April as Camp Commandant. On the 6th April 1945
I left HANQMAG with a transport of 350 prisoners and we marched on the.
road without a fixed destination until we arrived at BELSEN Concentration
Camp; that was about the 12th April 1945. From MLSEN I left for
HAMBURG after about two days where I was drafted into a combat/ant unit.
That unit was disbanded in HOLSTEIN at the beginning of May 1945*
On the 5th July 1945 I was arrested by Englishmen in LIPPERREIHE, Kreis
LEMGO.
There were approximately 950 prisoners in LAUJ^AHUTTE which
consisted for the most part of Hungarians and French. The remainder
consisted of Dutch, Belgians, and Germans. The composition of the
500 (approximately) prisoners in HANOMAG was about the same, as they
were for the most part the same people as in LAURAHUTTE with the
exception of some prisoners that were unfit for work who had arrived
later and who were chiefly Norwegians from NEUENGAMME.
4.	My instructions, as Camp Commandant, were that prisoners
who had done something wrong had to be reported to me and if I could
not deal with the matter locally I forwarded the report to the first
Schutzhaft-Lager-Fuhrer, Oberstursnfuhrer SCH8TTKL, who was a Bavarian
to Ey knowledge. I issued the same instructions to the guards in
LAURAHUTTE and said to them that they were not allowed to beat prisoners.
In HANCBAG Camp I was under orders of Hauptsturmfubrer KLEEBECK and
received ay instructions for prisoners, from him. I did not issue
any special instructions to the guard there as they were the same as
in LAGEAHUTTE. The guards in both camps were naval gunners v.hich
were later on replaced by the SS. About ten SS men .were in charge of
the administration as Blockfuhrers in both Camps.
5.	As regards the transport from LAURAHUTTE fnsx to MAUTHAUSEN
I must say that it lasted five days and the rations for the prisoners﻿PAGE TWO OP TRANSLATION CP DEPOSITION OP Walter QUAKERNACK.
M
and guards were insufficient. On this transport about 20 prisoners
died. If prisoners beoaae weak or fell^il]. en route I had them taken
to the truck that was equipped as	Sm? where^, for the most part^
they died in the care of the 3 prison doctors. On my instructions
the guards occasionally fired warning shots when the prisoners opened
the ventil/ators in a truck on their own intiative. I am not aware
that any prisoners were hit by these warning shots. The average
number of prisoners in each of these cattle trucks was about 80. I
admit to have shot one prisoner. Before leaving for HANCMAG, bread
and other rations, insofar as they were available, were issued to the
prisoners in groups (Rottenweise). During this a disturbance arose
as some prisoners left their ranks and fought for the rations amongst
each other. As the guard showed themselves to be incapable tip restore#*
order amongst the people I went to the scene of the disturbance, but I //
did not succeed either and the prisoners pushed towards me. As I felt
myself threatenS&n my personal safety at that moment^ I drew my pistol
and fired at a prisoner in order to frighten him. I hit the man at
oneor two metrestrange and the man died soon afterwards. It is possible
that I said something then which could, be interpreted in such a manner
taat other prisoners who disturbed the order would meet the same fate.

6.	At official punishments prisoners received a number of
strokes with a stick in the hut, namely five, ten or fifteen strokes
according to the crime and award. On one occasion a German Kapo
received 20 strokes of the stick, because he had beaten another prisoner#
This official punishment was carried out two or three times a week on
one to five prisoners. On the other hand I found it advisable sometimes
to chastise a man myself by slapping his face tv/ice or three times in
order to spare him a bigger official punishment. I always wore gloves
on these occasions.
7.	On one occasion a young Russian escaped but was later
rettcaptured and brought back in a car from MONGWITZ. One Oberscharfuhrer
WIQJZOEEK brought along with the prisoner an order in writing to hang the
man. This was carried out in an unfinished open barrack room and all
prisoners were made to witness it. This order^howeve^ came from the
Kommandantur in MONOWITZ.

8.	It is correct that in Camp HANGMAG about six prisoners
died daily. The prisoners clerk named LEHMANN can testify to it that
on various occasions I dictated letters to the Firm HANQMAG with a
request to supply food and mediciifat^^Similar letters concerning clothes
and sanitary arrangements to HauptstUrmfuhrer KLEESECK.

9.	I know that on the transport from HANdCAG to BELSEN of
which I was in charge approximately 24 prisoners died or were shot,.
Before leaving for HANNOVER I reported^Hauptsturmfuhrer KLEEKECK about
’the bad state of health of the prisoners and his orders were to shobt
prisoners w^id" could not walk ary further as an act of mercy. I made
this order known to the guards.
10.	The luggage of the SS guards together with the remainder
o£ 'he rations were put on a truck and the truck was pulled by prisoners.
11.	Y/ith the exception of the prisoner whom I shot at the
bread issue I have shot nobody. I assume however that Rottenfuhrer REX
has,according to Siiy estimate,shot most prisoners,of all the guards.
12.	In one case I was present when prisoners were shot by the
guards on this march. There we.e about four or five prisoners who had﻿PAGE THREE OP TRANSLATION OP DEPOSITION OP Walter QUAKERNACK.
fainted en route and had been dragged along by other prisoners. I
did not Y/ant to leave these peojble in a ditch like so much cattle but
had them put out of their misery in this manner. One or two guards
who were left behind with them received orders from me to put the
weak prisoners out i>f their misery,byrfc shooting them,and other prisoners
who marched at the end of the column,carrying shovels,were ordered to
dig a grave for the dead, at the side of the road

name is Karl Artur GOSBERG, I was born on 10 Aug 01 in WUPPERTAL
and I aa of German nationality.
I was called up to tke Waff'en SS ©n 29 Sep 40. At tke Wekrkreis
KgMmand® I signed a form to say tkat I volunteered for tke SS
and was sent to tke concenteticn camp MAUTHAUSEN. I reacked tke
rank ©f Umtersckarfukrer on 30 Jul 44.
I kad my ■training in Mautkausem and stayed in tke same camp in
tke Wacktsturmbann till Oct 44. I did guard duties tkere as a
Rgttenfiikrer witk Komaand® Max at tke railway station till spring
44.Tkem I was put at tk® dispssal of tke administration, of camp
Blyzin by tke Wirtsckafts Ver-waltungs Hauptaat. I arrived tkere
areund tke end of Feb 44 and acted as deputy ef tke camp commandant
O-^ersckarfukrer Georg HELLER, Wko was sick at tke time. In Jun 44
I was sent to Warsaw.
1$ Warsaw I was posted t© tke local labour camp as KomHandefiikrer.
I went into action in tke Warsaw rising - witk tke 4tk policecoy -
and came to BUCHENWALD after tke rising was surpressed.Tkere I
remained as an Umtersckarfukrer in tke 1st Cey of tke SS Sturmbamm
till Apr 45.1 left before tke Americans arrived and I went into
action against tke Americans near LEIPZIG. Wkem I Heard in May 45
tkat tke German army kad capitulated, I put on civilian clothes
and went home to WUPPERTAL.There I was arrested on 18 May 45•
1$. tke camp BLYZIN were Women men and children, mainly Jews of
Polish nationality and some German Jews.
In MAUTHAUSEN I received the usual guard instructions, tkat, if a
prisoner goes past tke line of sentries whilst trying to escape,
firearms kad to be used.
We were forbidden t© kit prisoners. In BLYZIN, where I was deputy s®
commandant, I was in charge of appx 2500 prisoners.Order amongst
priseners was kept up by the prisoners themselves, through the
blockleader. I have not given an order that blockleaders should hit
prisoners.Occasionally there were quarrels between blsckleaders
and prisemers, but of a harmless nature, and they were settled
without beating. Neither have I given an order that blockleaders
not allswed to beat prisoners. Sometimes a prisoner, who had
been kit by his blockleader, did hit back, but I did not intervene.
T@ the cfeages against ae, I have to reply, that neither d-uring the
roll-call, nor in the workshops, nor anywhere else have I hit a
prisoner. During the time I was in charge of BLYZIN, tke prisoners
received the saae amount of food as we receive here.
o#iy 3-4 prisoners died every week. There were no intakes to camp
BLYZIN during my time, as the camp was under quarantine because of
Typhus. Every day I saw 10-20 prisoners in the sick bay, who kad
reported sick.
I once kad an argument witk Obersekarfukrem SCHRAMM, because
SCHRAMM intended to make the prisoners work longer hours. I told
hi® then it was out ®f question, as we had to keep to the labour
instructions, which allowed a maximum of 10 working hours. And then
it would have changed the roll-call and the daily routine too much.
T&e argument went so far, that latero® SCHRAMM and I did not even
look at each other.
I was tke only SS raan by the name of GOSBERG in camp BLYZINi

aufzupassen, dass niemand den Arbeitsplatz verliess. Die ge-

Holzminden, sworn before Captain George Macpherson HEARD, Royal Artillery,
of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team at No.5 CIC PADERBORN on 12th Pebraary
1946.
1.	I am Hermann BUETTNER and I was born on the 5th of March 1911
in HEIDELBERG. I am of German nationality. I live at Bahnhof VOHWHQLE
Kreis Holzminden.
2.	I joined the NSDAP on 18 July 1930. On 2nd September 1939
I was called up into the 7th Totenkepfstandarte in BIDHENWALD. I served in
the following camps at following times: BRUENN 5 September 1939 - November
1939, FRANKFURT Aid ODER November 1939 - January 1940, EBELSBERG bei WIEN
January 1940 -	10 January 1940, 0RANI3NBURG 10 January 1940 - December 1940,

January 1944 - January 1945, BUCHENVALB 19 February 1945 - 2 April 1945. The
journey from KRAKAU to BUCHENV7ALD took approndmately three weeks, as we were
using horse drawn transport.
3.	I was appointed Unterscharfuhrer on 20 April 1940. I was
promoted to the rank of SS Scharfuhrer in November 1940 and reached the rank
of Oberscharfuhrer in January 1942. During the whole of my service I was
employed in the medical section.
4.	My job was to assist the SS doctor. Usually I remained in
the Sickbay, but I went sometimes into the camp, to check up on the doctors,
who as a rule were prisoners, or to examine prisoners. I worked with the
following’doctors in the following camps. In ORANIENBUEG with Standarten-
fuhrer Dr. NOMMENSEN, in NATZWEILER with Hauptsturmfuhrer Dr. BLANKS, in
RAVENSBRUCK with Oberstimnfuhrer Dr. SONNTAG and with Hauptstumfuhrer Dr.
SCHIEEL AUSKT, in BEL SEN with Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. KRIEGER, in KRAKAU with
Hauptsturmfuhrer Dr. JAEGER, in BUCHENWALD with Hauptsturmfuhrer Dr. BLANKE,
who has been in NATZWEILER, and with Hauptsturmfuhrer Dr. SCHTEDLAUSKY,who
has been in RAVENSBRUCK.
5.	I spent approximately two hours every day in the camp. I never
saw one of the Doctors illtreat a prisoner. The medical conditions were good
in BELSEN in May 1943. I had to go to BERLIN dvery four weeks to collect
medicines. I Obtained approximately three quarters of the amount I asked for.
Then there were Americans in the camp. Three thousand Polish Jews, who had
American papers came to BELSEN at the end of May. They were living in stone
buildings, 70 — 80 prisoners in one room. Women, men and children were not
separated. Approximately 15 prisoners died every month in the hospital
in BELSEN. I have never hit anybody. I have only been helping sick people.
We did not undertake any operations in BELSEN, because the sickbays were too
small and it was impos. ible to clean the instruments. It happened that
prisoners died, as an operation was necessary but has not been done. We
had 30 - 50 beds in the sickbay. When I was there Polish prisoners did not
have to work, as all the work was done by German prisoners. When I came to
BELSEN for?two days visit in April 1945, approximately 1200 Polish Jews were
sent to THEHESIENSTADT. On the journey to THEKESIENSTADT they were not
accompanied by medical orderlies but only by guards. At that time I met
Dr. SCHWIEGER (woman specialist), one of the prisoners, with whom I worked
in 1943. He was also sent to THEEESIENSTADT.﻿6.	Every S3 man in MEUENGAl'/llv£E had to sign, that he was fofcfrxfcden
to hit prisoners. This was an order given by Hauptsturmfuhrer WEII
s fofcEdVj
7.	In +BIX3HENWALD prisoners were hit if they tried to get
into the sickbay, even though they were not really ill.

the only medical orderly by the name of BUETTKER in BELSEN.

1.	I am 31 years of age and I was arrested on 17th May 1943, hy the
Gestapo, heoause I 'belonged to a Polish Underground organisation. I was confined
for six weeks in a dark cell in Warsaw prison and I was then sent to Lemberg
prison where I remained for five months. I was then transferred to Berkenau
Concentration Camp and on 4th December 19'44 "to ike men's cairp Auschwitz where I
remained for two weeks. I was then sent to Cracow prison for six weeks and 1
came to Belsen in January 1945»	1 wts tried before a political court at Lerriberg
and sentenced to be confined to a concentration camp for an indefinite period.
2.	Ihilst at Berkenau I was in Block 12 and HELENA.KOEPER was in
Block 18 which was opposite to my block. I was warned by SOFIA MALY3, who was
Secretary of block 18, never to say anything in the presence of HOPPER as she,
KDEPER, was a spy working for the SS. MALYS was later sent to Ravensbruck.
Whilst I was at Berkenau I was told by many other prisoners that KOPPER had given
information to the SS and that many prisoners had been punished as a result.
3.	When I arrived at Belaen KOPPER was Block Altester of Block 205
and later of Block 224. She later became a camp policewoman. I myself was
Block Altester of Block 201 but after being in Belen for a month I was yaken ill
with Typhus and was sick for two and a half months. Whilst sick I lived in
Kitchen 1 Block and then about the beginning of April 1945 I moved to the
Maternity Block.
4.	About the end of March 1945? whilst in Kitchen 1 Block, Belsen,
I saw through the window the woman KOPPER together with about 40 other women
Block-leaders. The other Block-leaders were beating KOEPER with their hands
and I saw her lall ctying to the ground. The others then left her and she got
up and went to the Hospital. A asked some of the other Block-leaders what was
the matter and they told me that KOEPER had reported to the SS that they, these
other Block-leaders, were in possession of jewellery. This was an offence in
A search was made of all the Block-leaders by two SS women whom I

told that their respective names are HERTA EHNERT and ELISABETH VOLKENRATH.
Nothing was found as a result of this search and they then searched KOPPLR
herself and found that she was wearing a gold chain and locket, in which was
a photograph of an 83 ac Belsen Camp. Upon finding this either VOLEEN ATH or
EHLERT told the other blocldeaders that KOEFER had given false information
and that they could beat her. The other Block-leaders then set about KOEPER.

5.	In Belsen KOPESR used to keep company v/ith one of the S. S. men. *>1 do not
know his name hut he used to visit the "block to see her and Bring her pacl<j^^ of
good. When he came otheiT?>risoners used to clear out of the way. KOEPER became
pregnant according to other prisoners and they all said that the S.S. man was
responsible. Then one day in March 1945 S.S. woman EHLERT came to the block to
search for jewellery but she was unable to find any as the women had hidden it. it
had been reported to, EHLERT by KOEPER that other prisoners were in possession of ■
jewellery and -when she did not find it she struck KOPEER and told the other prisoners
to set about her. KOHPSR was hated by the other prisoners and they all began to
beat her. KOEPER had to be taken to hospital afterwards, and I was told by other
prisoners that she had a miscarriage when about four months pregnant.
6.	I identify No. 3 on Photograph 37 as an S. 3. woman who was an Aufseherin
in kitchen Ko. 1 at -‘-'elsen. I know her by the name of JLSE PORETER. I often saw
FORSTER beating other prisoners with a thick stick in the kitchen. She struck
male prisoners across the head, and women, across the backside but sometimes she hit
women on the head too. I have seen FORSTER beat many prisoners until they were
unconscious and they were then left lying bleeding on the floor. These beatings
were inflicted in a room within the same building as the cook-house and I saw the
beatings through a window of the room. These beatings were given because prisoners
asked for food or because they took food from the kitchen. I have seen unconscious
prisoners who had been beaten by FORSTER taken away on a wheelbarrow to the hospital.
I do not know whether any of them died as a result of their injuries, out many were
covered with blood.

BY ACCUSED:
X never was a soy for the SS and cannot understand why anyone shoulS
accuse me of that. RdlM S Y I S T A L was not in the SS: he was|
a Pole in the WSKSMACEE, and I had known him in Cracow before the w
It is untrue that I ever reported to the SS that any ox the prisoned
were in possession of Jewelry. During the searches f or j©we ry 0°- 7
my own bed and room were searched, because the other Blocualtesue
reported to the Camp Commandant that I was in possession of jewelry.
I was searched as a result and my ring and necklace taken arid I was I
beaten by Ober-Assistant A S S M A N H. My am and nose were broken^
with a stick and then I was put into solitary confinement j. or. 20 on
The occasion on which the other Blockalteste beat me had nothings to
do with jewelry or valuables; It was because they said 1 had drawn
120 rations more than ray block was entitled to draw, x never made
any reports about jewelry or valuables to So woman EEiLLRT
i﻿I never accepted "bribes from prisoners to induce me to favour them,
I,iy komoando was nearly all Hungarians, and had nothing with which to
bribe me, I never excused anyone from "Apeli" in return for food: I
already got more food than the other prisoners because I had friends
in the kitchen, and also 'ROMM SYISTAL brought me plenty of food.
Some Biockalteste used to take the rations into their ovm rooms, but
I never did; instead, I used to divide them up evenly in front of
the other prisoners. I do not remember the incident about EOEPL, but
if she returned from the hospital late in the evening, she should
have drawn her rations from the hospital. I did not Iceep back extra
food; and as I g»t butter from RORlM SYISTAL I had no need of
margarine. So far from keeping back food from the prisoners, I
used to give them food from my own -supplies.
I admit freely that I slapped prisoner’s on the face, but this was
only because it was necessary to preserve discipline. I used to
feel sorry-for striking them, especially the elder people, but I
used to become nervous^ because if my list at roll-call was not
correct, I would be compelled to do two hours' " port" in the office
or elsewhere and I was afraid: of it.	I never used a stick, strap
or whip; sometimes X threatened prisoners.with my leather belt,
which was only about an inch wide, but I never actually struck them
with it. I have nly slapped prisoners, and never kicked them: I
would have remembered if KO RL had been in my kommando because her
name is so like my own. The only time I have made anyone kneel
was once on parade, when 1 made my friend JMIMA KRAJMSEA aged 25,
kneel for five minutes for talking and moving while the camp
commandant was on parade.
It is quite untrue that I beat or killed the Polish woman who was
sick in toy block."

AND
DEPOSITION OB HELENA KOEPER (Female) late of Plocky, Hmgary, sworn before
Major SAVILE GEOFPREI GHAt.IPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team*
-|4	i ^ 35 years of age. Neither my husband nor I are Jewish.
I was arrested in Gracow in June 194-0 because, the Gestapo suspected me of
anti-German sympathies and found me in possession of an anti-German pamphlet.
I was in prison for four months at the Gestapo prison, Cracow. I was sent
to Ravensbruck Camp in October 194-0 and subsequently to Auschwitz-Berkenau
in October 1941, thence to Belsen-Befgen in December 1944.
2.	I recognise No. 2 on photograph Z/4-/2 as 8S . Aufseherin IRMA. GK&SE.
I knew her first in Ravensbruck in 1941 but I know of nothing against her
during that time. She was Blockleader at Auschwitz and subsequently in
charge of the punishment company in Auschwitz from 1942 to 1944.	She was in
charge of the punishment company when working outside the camp for sax months
in 1943. The remainder of the time she did not go outside. I was also in
the punishment coirpany/during the time that GRESE was in charge when working
outside the Camp in a sand-pit. There were 700-800 women working in this
■ company some of which were detailed to dig sand and fill iron trucks with the
said and others had to push these trucks along a narrow gauge railway,
place in which to worked was surrounded, by a strand of wire about three to foux
feet high and we were not allowed to go outside this boundary
' Were twelvb guards placed at intervals around the wire. It was the practice
of GRESE to pick out certain of the Jewish women prisoners and order them to
get something from ths other side of the wire. She always Yforked with mter-
preters. 'When the prisoners approached the wire they v/ere challenged by the
guard but as GRESE usually picked out non-Gemans they did not understand the
order and walked on and were shot. Some even of the prisoners who did under-
stand German and knew it was daeth to cross the wire did so beoausethey were
too weary and ill to bother. Occasionally a guard would not shoot but would
force the prisoner tonretum to the working party, I myself was called﻿as a -witness at an enquiry which was held by the political department on a
guard who refused to shoot prisoners which G-BESE had. ordex’ed to cross the
wire. At the enquiry I identified the guard who was handcuffed. In my
presence the Guard stated that the women were being worked too hard and that
GEESE was purposely sending them to the wire so that they would be shot. The
next day the guard was on duty again, and GEESE had gone, I next saw her in
Belsen in February or March 1945 a 'Rapportfuherin.
3.	Whilst GEESE was in charge of the working party she always carried
a rubber truncheon. She was responsible for at least 30 deaths a day
resulting from her orders to cross the wire mut many more on occasions. It
was always my jobq ordered by G-BESE3 to count the dead and 1, together with
some other women, used to load the bodies into one or the railway wagons
after working hours. The bodies were subsequently removed by ambulance. I
*
know two of the women who helped me on these occasions, their names are
GMIN'A STASICKA and EAROLA MIKOT. I saw them last on 8th June 1945 in Belsen
Gamp. Both are Polish Aryans. Their Auschwitz numbers tattooed onntheir
arms are 18565 & 18566 - I do not know which of them had which number. Both
had lived at Gracow. I know the name of . one internee who was shot by a guard
when ordered to cross the wire. It wab ANITA GIMTERWEISS of Czeczovri.cs, near
Gracow. In fact I wrote to her son to tell him that his Mother had died. It|
is possible that orders to cross the wire were not given in every case by G-ESSE
because the Capos used to try it but it is a3jnost certain that GRESE was
responsible in almost every case.
1 identify Ho. 3 on photograph 19 as an SS woman who was at
Auschwitz during 1945/4. I knew her by the name of BOHMMN and have now
been told that her full name is JUMA BORMAHH. She was the worst hated
person in the camp. At first she was in charge of the clothing store and -
then in charge of labour. She always had with her a large dog wlxuoh she
set on to the prisoners. On one occasion when I was undergoing a minor
punishment, it was in the summer of 1944 as near as I canremenfoer, I wan
kneeling down with my hands in the air and I saw BOEMAHN appeoach a prisoner,
a female, who was going towards the offices. BORMAHH stopped the woman
and took something out of the woman’s pocket. She then hit the prisoner
with her right hand and then clasping her by the hair threw the woman to the﻿»■
ground, 30SMMH was holding the dog by ,a strap in her left hand and Mien
the woman was lying on the ground she let the dog go and it bit the woman
severely. When the dog had finished the woman was a mass of blood and one
of her breasts had been tom severely. A Doctor, SS OberstuiTafulirei KODEK,
came and examined, the woman. He was a good Doctor and behaved always well.
There was no movement from the body and four prisoners were instructed to take
the body away on a steetcher to Block 25 which ms notorious as the death Blodk
that is the block to which people were taken when they were dying or where they
were lodged prior to being taken to the gas chamber.
In i%.2 not long after I had been at Auschwitz, BOBMANN found some
cigarettes and photographs in my bed. For t his she beat me on the face with
her hand and then set her dog on to me. I ms bitten in the left arm near th<
elbow. BOEMANH walked me to the Hospital and I was there for six weeks. I
believe BOHMAM called the dog off only because she was a sadist and enjoyed
doing that sort of thing. I received an official beating &r having cigarettes
when I came out of hospital. BOKMAKN left Auschwitz in the summer of i'm.
I recognise Ho. 5 onnphotograph 22 as an SS Oberaufseherin at
Belsen, I knew her by the name of EHLEKT and I have now been told that her
full name is HERTA EHLERT. Two weeks before the English came, xt was an
early April, the roll call at my block was incorrect and EHLERT beat me with
her hand, but not very much, but she stopped the food the next day, for the
whole block as a punishment.
7.	I recognise Ho. 6 on photograph 22 as, an SS woman who was at
Auschwitz. I knew her by the name of VOLKEHRATH and have now been told that
her full name is ELIZABETH VOLKENRATH. She ms responsible for selections
for the Gas Chamber at Auschqitz Camp from Block 18 where I lived. I attended
seven selection parades and she and SS Rapportfuhrer TAUBER between them
made all the selections. VOLKSNRATH was not merely acting as a guard - she
personally picked out victhns for the Gas Chamber, On one occasion out of a
block containing 1A00 prisoners there were only about 300 left after the
selections had been made. I left Auschwitz in Hoveiiber 1914- and next saw
VOUOIIRATH at Belsen in February 1945, when she said to me that Germany had
lost the war and, we hould all be hanged.﻿8,	I knew an S3 Oberaufseherin DRBGIiSEL at Suschwits. I yrould
describe her as about 30 years of age, 5ft 4 ins in height, very thin with
bright brown thin hair. She has two protuding front teeth, a long thin
nose and pale complexion. She walked with her head bent forward. She was
responsible for*selections, for the Gas Chamber and I myself have seen her
doing this many times.
9.	I knew an SS Arbeitdienstfuhrerin E&SSE at Auschwitz. I would
describe her as about 28 years of age, about 5ft Sins in height, very
blonde hair (natural), straight and worn in an upward style, blue eyes,
blonde eyebrows, small mouth, round fane, healthy complexion, slim build,
good even teeth, beautiful good figure and very smart in her dress. This
woman was in charge of the transport columns which arrived at Auschwitz from
time to iiasa. These transport columns consisted of people who were to be
exterminated at once and they did not spend any time in the CaP3?*
used to lead the columns to the gas chamber and where there were babies in
arms she ordered them to be thrown into a hole which was connected to a stove
and they were burnt alive. I was enployed. in cleaning up the ground near
the crematorium and I saw this happen many times. BASSE always wore a pistol |
but I never saw her use it ~ only to threaten people.
•10.	I recognise No. 5 o*1 photograph 1 as an S3 man who v/as chief eook
at Bel sen. I have now been told that his name is KARL ELBA2ICE. A week
before the English arrived I went to fetch food from the kitchen for my block
and the internees who were queuing for their food started to push and FLBAZICH j
who always stood on the steps at the entrance to the kitchen, shot a girl wit
his pistol. The girl, who was pregnant, was shot in the am and as she
belonged to my block I jrook her to the Hospital. She became unconscious and
died whilst I was there. I cannot say Y/hy she died as she was. only shot in
the am - she was very weak. I know this because a Doctor examined her
and told me she was dead. M ^loclc was next to the ld-tchen 811(1 1 SOT
ELRASIGH shooting repeatedly at the internees many of whom fell down and were
flung on to a heap.﻿11.
I knew an SS woman- sailed FRANZ who wan chief cook at Auschwitz.
I would describe her as aged about 32, height about 5* 9rt> hair black (straight
and parted on left side), eyes green, complexion ruddy, very small nose, good
teeth (even). One gold tooth in left upper jaw visible when laughing, round
face, thin black eyebrow^, small mouth, short neck, plumply built, appears to
waddle when walking, small white hands, wears a plain ring and a ring with a
large red stone on the 3rd finger of right hand, dresses neatly, veiy clean and
does not use makeup. I met her often when I went to get the bread for my
block at the bread store and I have seen her beat many people with a stick for
no apparent reason. She was at Auschwitz all the time I was thei.e.
12.	I recognise No. 1 on photograph QA/1 ad an SS man.whom I know at
Auschwitz and Belsen. I have also seen him in custody and I know beyond all
doubt that he is the same man. I knew him by the name oi HANSI and I have now
been told that his full name is HEINRICH SCHKEIER. I first met SCKKEIER in th£
winter of 191,-3/3 at Auschwitz, He was in charge of a Strafekommando xn which
I was working. He sopke to everyone in the Strafekommando and asked them
their jobs in civil life and whem I told him that I was a professor of music he
at' once became interested. He talked all day about music end politics,
spoke badly of the Germans and said that the war was already lost. One day I ,
was sentenced to 12 days ki the bunker for smoking. SCHESIM was in charge
of this bunker. He told	me that he was in charge	of the political department
and that he would tell me	all that was going on	if	I would play the violin	for
him. I agreed to do so and he brought me a violin. He told me that 10
people in the bunker were	to be hanged and many	to	be gassed the next day.	I
played ‘Mother Love1 to him and he told me that	he	had no mother ana n I
played it again he would shoot me. He also asked me to play something
Rumanian or French and when I asked for music he said he would write it for me
which he did. When I had finished playing for him he wrote on the door-post
•England will come to help’.
13.	I afterwards spoke to an American boxer named JACOB who was in the
bunker and he told me that SCHKEIER was an intelligent man and spoke Rumanian,
French, Polish, Russian, Gennan ,nd English. SGHREIBR spent almost each
day in my cell and I formed the opinion that he was not normal. He told me﻿that he was a homosexual. After I was released from the bunker SCHKEIER
said that he wanted me to join the canp band but I could not do that whilst I
was in the punishment party. In an attempt to get me off the punishment
party SOHEEIER arranged a meeting for me with KESSLER whom I identify as 1'To. i
on photograph 9. KESSLER told me that I had to stay in the punishment party.
14.	I saw SGEREIER whilst I was at Belsen in December 1944 or January
194-5.	I spoke to him about 3 times. Ihe last time I saw him was at 2100
hours one evening about three weeks before the British came. He came to my
room and he was very dirty. He said that he had been Y/orking in the woafe
and had buried some secret papers. 1 said that I would like to see Y/here
they -were and he agreed to take me. Tfe went out of the camp to a spot
between the crematorium and the sand-pit and he showed me where five or six
boxes were buried. They were only covered with a little earth which he
scraned. av/ay and X actually -saw the boxed which he said contained the las6
papers the Germans possessed and ammunition. On 31st June 1945 I showed
Captain A.J.F0S, General List, DABvl, 86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of
Military Police, where the boxes, had been buried. They were no longer there,
15.	One day in Belsen SCIiSEIER showed me three passports or identity
cards.	Each of them had a photograph of him and each card was Ynritten in a
different language, and the names were different names. Tue name bCHEEIER
was not one. I do not think SGHEEIER is his real name. There was an
elderly man at Auschwitz whose name was SGHEEIER,

A BLOCKLEADER NAMED HELENA KOPER
DEPOSITION OP PAULA SINGER (itemaie) late of 46 Pilsudsldego, Starachowice, Poland,
sworn before Major 8AVILS GEOPFREY CHAMEION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No, 1
War Grimes Investigation Team.
4
1.	I am 28 years of age and because I am a Jewess I was arrested by
the Gestapo on 28th October 1942 and placed in a labour camp at Starachowice
where I remained until 3rd July 1944* I was then transferred to Berkenau and
on 3rd October 1944 I came to Belsen.
2.	I first met HELENA KOPER on 3rd October 1944 when I arrived at
Belsen.	KOPER had travelled in the same transport as me from Auschwitz but
I did not see her on the way. Within about a month of my arrival at Belsen
KOPER became assistant blockaltester am Block 27 of the women's section of
Belsen camp. I was in the same block. In December 1944 KOPER became block-
altester of block 205 and later at block 224. All the prisoners in block 27
moved to blocks 205 did 224. I was a clerk in each of these blocks and shared
the blockaltester's room with KOPER. KOPER became a lager policewoman about
the end of February 1945. She only held this post for a few days.
3.	I saw KOPER beat other women prisoners practically every day,
usually with a leather belt but I have seen her using a v/ooden stick. These
beatings usually took place on Apells and KOPER picked on those who did not
move quickly enough or who did not stand properly in line etc. When she
beat anyone she struck them again and again on all parts of the bodj’'. I have
often seen her beat sick vromen who were not fit to attend Apell often beeau.se
they complained to her.
4.	I remember one day in January 1945 di old woman on Apell was
sick and tired and could not stand properly. KOPES made her kneel down to»
attention. It was very cold at the time and there was snow on the ground.
An S3 woman attending the Apell, I do not know her name, asked why the old
lady was kneeling and said that it was wrong to make her kneel. KOPER
objected and told the S3 woman that the old lady must continue to kneel
as she did not obey orders. The woman was left kneeling for about half an hour.﻿I saw all this take place.
5.	I heard from other prisoners that KDPER did exouse prisoners
from attending Apell hut they had to give her food for doing so. I have seen
KOPBR bring extra food into the room I shared with her and consume it herself.
I believe that this was given to her by other prisoners for excusing them from
attending Apell. KOPER was responsible for distributing the'food fairly among
other prisoners in her block but X saw that she always kept for herselx more
than she was entitled to have. KOPER disposed of some of this extra food uo
other prisoners in exchange for margarine etc.
6.	I have been told by KOPER that she acted as spy for the S3 and
it was generally knovci by most prisoners that this was so. She reported
to the S3 things she had seen other prisoners doing and suoh prisoners, if
they had done wrong, were then punished by the S3.
7.	KOPER kept company with an S3 man named ROMM Sl/TSTAL and this
man used to visit the block and sleep with KOPER in her oed.
in the same room and saw them in bed together on many occasions.
I had to sleep
SVISTAL left
Belsen a few weeks before the British t oops arrived.
7.	Since Belsen canp was liberated by the British I have seen HELENA
KOPER in No. 3 Camp. I would describe KOPER as aged about 35 years, height
5ft 5ins, broad build, stout, dark brown hair, full face, brovm eyes. She has
told me that her father is a German Aryan and her mother a Polish Jewess. She
also said that her husband served with the German Army and that her two sons wer<,
in the Hitler Youth Movement.

DEPOSITION OP HALINA PURSTENBERG (SWALE) late of 29 Sientawicza, Plock,
near Warsaw, Poland, sworn before Major SAVILE GEOPEREY CHA1£PI0N, Royal
Artillery, Eagal Staff No. 1, War Grimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age and in autumn 1942 I was moved with other
Jews living at Sientawioza to Starachowice, a small toon reserved for Jews
only. In autumn 1943 I was moved into a labour camp on the outskirts of
Starachowice and made to work in a munition factory. In the late summer of
1914 I was moved to Berkenau where I remeined until I came to Belsen in
November 1944*
2.	Whilst at Belsen camp I was in Block 27 and the assistant Block
Altester was a Polish Jewess named HELENA KOPPER. I was cleaner for .
this block. We later moved- to Block 205 and. after that to Block 224; in
both these blocks I acted as cleaner. KOPFER beoame Block Altester in
Block 205 and later in Block 224 camp policewoman for a week, relinquishing
her job as Block Altester.
3.	I have frequently seen KOPPER beat other women prisoners. These
beatings usually took place in the block round about the time that Appels
were being held. She beat prisoners because they did not hurry on to Appel
or because they hurried away to their blocks after Appel. . She also beat
prisoners for trifling offences such as speaking or moving on Appel., She
usually beat prisoners with a stick but at other times a leather strap was
used, or she picked up anything and beat the prisoners on the head and all
parts of the body. When she picked on someone for a beating she beat them
again and again. On several occasions when an Appel was on she made old
women kneel on the ground, usually for speaking or something bH that nature.
She rarely made a young person kneel - it was always an old woman. Apart from
the incident mentioned in paragraph 6 hereof I cannot remember any other
specific instance directly involving death due to beatings adminisoerea by
KOPPER. I know, however, that KOPEER beat several other women, who
the
subsequently died, but I am not ahle to say whether/deaths were due to
beatings or not.	I believe that the beatings certainly contributed to﻿k
death. The victims were starved and in ill health at the time of the
beatings and the beatings Y/ere such as to endanger life in persons in this
condition.
4.	On one occasion in January '1945 during very cold weather KOEFER
made a Polish Jewess aged about 45 years, I do not know her name, kneel
on the ground for half an hour. This was because the vroman had spoken
while on parade. The S. S. women on the parade said, after the woman
had knelt a short time, that it was enough but KOPPER said '"She must
learn to stand at Apell" and made the old woman continue to km eel.
*
Sometimed when she was in a dab mood she came into the room and beat
women for no apparent reason.
5.	Once when KOPPER was camp policewoman I saw other Block
Altesters beating her. I asked them what it was for and they told me that
they had beaten her because she had given information to the SS that they
werebin possession of jewellery, evennthough they were not. This was
apparently an attempt to get them into trouble. I was told th&t the
5.	S. instead of finding jewellery on the Blocldeaders had found a gold
chain and locket on KOPPER and that they had told the Blockleaders to
beat her. She was later- put in the bunker. The locket she wore had
a photograph in it of an S. S. man named ROMM SVISTAL with ■whom KOPPER
kept company. I have seen them in bed together.
6.	I remember an occasion when there vras a Polish Jewess aged about
30 years ,siok in the block. I cannot remember this woman’s name. This
woman missed her food one day and she went to KOFPER and asked her for it.
Instead of giving her food KOEPER beat her again and again over the head
with a leather strap. When the woman fell to the ground unconscious
KOPPER continued to beat her. The woman remained unconscious for an
hour and after regaining consciousness kept lapsong into unconsciousness.
*
She suffered from concussion. Three or four days after she had been
beaten by KOPPER this woman died. I saw this beating, and I saw the
woman die. I also saw other prisoners take the woman's dead body out﻿of the block
7.	I saw at the office of No. 1 War Grimes Investigation Team
Belsen, on 15th June 1945? a woman whom I recognise as the said HELENA
KOPFER.

before Major SAVIEE GEOFPREY CHAMPION, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 29 years of age,	In January 1940 the Germans converted
Lodz, where I lived, into a Ghetto and I was held there until about June 1944
when I was transferred to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. After about a fortnight
at Auschwitz I was transferred to Belsen.
2.	I first saw HELENA KOEPER in Block 205 at Belsen during the
winter of 1944/5. Hived in Block 205 myself and KOPPER was Block Altester.
All the prisoners from Block 205 including myself were later moved to Block 224
where KOPPER continued as Block Altester.	A few weeks, before the British
arrived KOPPER became a camp policewoman.	I have heard from other prisoners
who have known KOEPER for some time that she is a Polish Jewess.
3.	I have frequently seen KOPPER beating other women prisoners
with her hands or a wooden stick, both in the block and on appel. One evening
in February 1945 I was sick and went to the hospital to get some medicine.
I did not return to block 205 until about 8 p.m. It was dark at the time and .
I had missed my food issue. I went to see KOPPER in the bldbk Altester’s room
and asked her for my ration. KOPPER said there was no food for me and I told
KOPPER that I had missed my ration and wanted food. KOPPER then beat me on
the face with her hands and she gave me a heavy blow in the face knocking me
unconscious. I recovered consciousness about three hours later and other
prisoners then told me that KOPPER Had been kicking me whilst I was laying on
the ground. Since this beating I have suffered from frequent headaches and
heart trouble.

i
1.	I am 42 years of age anffl in. the summer of 1942 I was compelled, under
orders from the Germans, to go to a labour camp at Starachowace Ytfiere I was
employed in a munition factory. I remained there until the ’winter of 1943 when
1 was moved to Auschwitz Concentration Camp. I came to Belsen in.February 1945.
2.	I first saw HELENA KOPPER in Bololc 27 at Belsen Camp where KOPPER was
Assistant Block Altester. I was in Block 27 myself. I later moved with
KOPPER and other prisoners to another block, the number of which I cannor remember,
and later to block 224. At the second block we went to KOPPER was Block Altester
and she also held this position in Block 224. Per a few days shortly before the
British troops arrived KOPPER was Lager policewoman.
3„	One day in February 1945 I attended an Apell of which KGEPER was in
charge. It was cold and there was snow on the ground. The Apell lasted
about two hours that day. After about an hour on this Apell I felt very cold
and moved my position slightly. KOEPER then came up to me ahd beat me across
the head and body with a leather strap she was carrying. The beating was very
painful and made me cry. After the beating KOPPER made me kneel down in the snow
for about an hour. Whilst I was kneeling down an SS woman, whom I identify as
No. 5 on photograph 22 and whose name I have been told is HERTA EBELERT, came up and
spoke to KOPPER. Hie said to KOPPER 'It is, enough' and KOPPER replied 'No she
must stay there. She did not stand straight.' I had to carry on kneeling.
4. •	At another Apell in February 1945jOf which Kopper ’was in charge, there
was a Polish woman named FISCHER, aged about 40 years, standing on parade without,
any shoes. She stood in her stockings. There was snow on the ground and
the weather was damp and cold. KOPPER came up to the woman FIbCHER and said
Mjhy are you not working? You should be with the working party.' FISCHER
replied 'I have no shoes. ' The Apell was at 8 a.m. and working parties had
gone out at 7 a.m. KOEPER, without saying any more, then beat FISCHER with a
leather belt, again and again across the head and other parts of thebody.﻿"FISCHER fell to the ground crying, and K0PE5R then made her kneel in the snow
for about an hour until Apell was finished. I was on this Apell and saw
all that happened. 1/hen ITSCHER returned to her Block, No. 222f, she was ill
and dah to lie down. She remained ill from then onwards until about three
weeks later when she died.	I was present when she died and I saw her dead
body carried out of the block by other women prisoners.	She had received no
medical attention.
5.	On another occasion in February 1945* just before Apell, I was
in the block when HOPPER ordered everyone outside on Apell. There was a
sick Polish woman who was suffering from heart trouble and swollen limbs. I
do not know this woman's name but she was about 35 years of age. She was
lying on the floor as there were no beds. In my presence this woman told
HOPPER that she felt too ill to attend Apell, HOPPER immediately started
to beat her with a leather strap and continued to do so until the woman got
on her feet. HOPPER then made her go outside and attend /spell. During
Aoell the woman collapsed on the ground unconscious. There was snow on the
ground at the time and the Polish vroman was left lying in the snow lor aoout
two hours no one being allowed to touch her because Apell was on. After
Apell I saw other prisoners carry the unconscious woman to the Hospital Block.
Three days later’ other prisoners told me. that the woman had died and I did
not see her again.
I have seen HOPPER beat other women prisoners with a wooden stick
or a leather belt every day at Belsen. She beat them on the head and all
parts of the body for trifling offences and often for nothing at all. As
she walked through the block she would beat women prisoners without reason.
On a number of occasions 1 have seen HOPPER beat other women prisoners until
ther were unconscious and many of her victims had to be taken to Hospital
for treatment.

Camp in Russia and in June 1944 I was transferredlto Auschwitz. In October 1944
I was transferred to BuchenwaM and in November 1944 I was transferred to Dora
Camp. After two days at Ellrich I came to Belsen at the end of March 1945*
2.	On 15th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SCAMANS, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whan I recognised as the
Capo who was in charge of my working party at Dora Camp. I have now been
informed that his name is VLADISLAV 03IR0I703KI.
3.	Whilst at Dora OSTRGWOSKI generally ill-treated prisoners, by
beating them, end not giving them sufficient to eat. He was responsible
for the issue of food to the prisoners but never distributed it fairly.
4.	After leaving Dora we spent two or three days in Ellridh Camp
before proceeding by train to Belsen. I was in Block 19 and OSIROWOSKI was
the Capo in charge of this block. Whilst we’were there one of the prisoners
excreted outside the bloak. OSTRCWOSKI ordered all the prisoners in block 19,
a total of 900 men, to sit down in a stooping position for three hours, he beat
many of the prisoners who rnovfcd with a wooden stick. As further punishment
he did not give us any food that day.
5.	Whilst at Belsen I was also in Block 19 and for a time OSTROWOSKI
acted as a camp policeman. Whilst we were lined up for food OSTROWQSKI walked
up and down the queue and for no reason at all beat prisoners with a wooden stick.
Many of the prisoners so struck had their heads cut open and I saw blood flowing
from their wounds. I saw many dead bodies in the carp, covered with blood. I
cannot state if the blows struck by OSTROWOSKI had killed them but I am sure
that the ill-treatment and beatings by him resulted in the death of many of
them. All the prisoners were in a weak condition and beatings such as those
given by OSTROWOSKI would most certainly accelerate death. OSTROWOSKE also
withheld the food at Belsen, giving it only to the strong and healthy prisoners
and so the sick prisoners were starved to death,
-1-
I cannot remember the names﻿of the victims as there were so many prisoners in the block and so many died,

1.	I-am 25 years of age and I served with a iJassian Artillery Regiment
until I was wounded and talcen prisoner by the Germans in the summer of 1941.
I was taken to a hospital in Berlin but after three weeks I escaped and went to
a Russian civilian labour camp in'Berlin - Marehflede where I lived, for about twc
years. In September 1943 I- was recaptured and sent to Buchenwald Concentration
Camp'. I was transferred to Dora Camp on 11th January 1945 and I caine to Belsen
on 9th April 1945.
2.	After leaving Dora Camp I spent two days in Ellrich ■ Camp and was in
block 19. On 15th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SCAMAHS, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of I.tLlitary Police, a man whom I recognised as the
Capo in charge of thsi block. I knew him by the name of OSTOWHKI but I have
now been informed that his full name is VLADISLAV OSTROivOSLI.
During the two days I spent at Ellrich Camp one of the prisoners
excreted outside block 19. Tire punishment for this, ordered by OSTROWOSKI,
was that the men of block 19, totalling approximately 900 men, had to remain for
three hours in a squatting position. OSTROWOSKI beat any prisoners "with a stidd
if they moved their position or spoke. He hit them on all parts of their bodies I
.and as, further punishment no food was given at all that day. I also saw, during
the two days at Ellrich, OSTROWOSKI beat many prisoners for no reason at all. He
' mainly used a broken soup ladle handle, which was made of metal and wood. I saj
many dead bodies talcen away after the victims, had been beaten by OSTROWOSKI.
4.	Whilst at Belsen I was in block 19 and OSTROWOSKI was acting in the
capacity of a camp policeman. When prisoners lined up for food he would go
down the line beating and hitting men with a wooden stick for no reason at all.
5.	Early one morning, just before the British liberated the cauro,
OSTROWOSKI ordered all men in block 19 on parade, including the sick. One of
the sick prisoners, either a Frenchman or a Belgian, whom I knew by the name of﻿AUBElff was so sick he could not move.	I saw OSTRQWOSKI approach this man and
hit him on the head. He was carrying something in his hand at the time but I
could not see what it was. The blow that the prisoner received from
OSTROWOSKI resulted in his death as I helped to carry many dead bodies on to a
heap outside block 19- a&d :the body of this man was amongst them.

QUESTICpH): My name is ThiYDISLAY OSl'ROTifSKI. I was horn on 27th June 1914 at Lodz
in Poland.	I worked in a dye factory at Lodz.	Inras arrested by
the Gestapo as a political prisoner in 1940, and kept in SCHERAZ prison,
abort 30 kilometres from Lodz. After about two and a half years I escaped
to Lodz, where I remained several weeks. My wife was then taken by the
Germans to work in Berlin, so I went to Berlin myself and obtained work as
a builder1s labourer. About nine months later 1 was again arrested and
taken to GROSS-ROSHM concentration camp. Some weeks later I was transfer-
red to DORA. After several w eksl was transferred to B12, a kbinmando near
dLLSRICH, and stayed there some months. I went to Ellerich for three days
and was then, sent to BELS3N, ./here I arrived at the beginning of April 1945*
■ At B12 I was chosen by the S3 as assistant to the prisoner blockleader.
I did not hold any such positions at the other camps,
CHARGED:	Tou are charged with the following offences at DORA, BLLERICH and BBLSMT:
1.	Working for the SS to the prejudice of your fellow-prisoners1 welfare.
2.	Talcing regards from the SS for ill-treating your fellow-prisoners.
3.	With-holding food from your fellow-prisoners, and not sharing it fairly
among them.
4.	Ill-treating your fe low-prisoners by unfairly punisfiing them.
5.	Beating your fellow-prisoners.
6i Murder, and in particular
(i)	murder at Ellerich of some prisoners whose names are not
known, by beating them so that they died the same day.
(ii)	murder at Belsen of a Frenchman by beating him with a
soup ladle or piece of iron.
Do you understand the charges made against you?
REPLY:	Yes.
CAUTIONED: You are not compelled, to make a statement, but may do so if you wish,
and it will be m-itten down and may be used in evidence.
REPLY:	I desire to make a statement.
STATEMENT I was chosen as second assistant to my blockleader, and so had to do what
BY ACCUSED: the SS told me. But I did not do more than I could help, and was several
times myself beaten by the SS. I never took any apells; it was not my job
The SS used to beat me, and I never got any rewards from them. The only
time I received any cigarettes-was one occasion when all prisoners were
given three each. I had nothing to do with the distribution of any food;
the soup was shared out by the first assistant, and bread by the block-
leader himself.
I did not hold A/ells specially to prevent prisoners from sleeping during
the night: some of the,prieoners were on night shifts and had to be woken
at special times. X did not make anyone squat.
It is time that I sometimes beat prisoners, but I only used my hands, never
a stick or a ladle. I had to do this in order to males them doiheir work.
If I had not done so, the SS would have beaten me.
I have never beaten anybody with a soup ladle or a piece of iron, and did net
kill the Frenchman or any of the other prisoners.
I desire to call as a witness on my behalf one UbBER, whom I last saw in
BELSEEf at the end of May 1945-

Ualthausen Oasip, where 1 remained for 18 months before being moved to
Wienerneustadt Gamp where 1 stayed for two months. . On leaving there I stayed for
five days at Buchenwald and then went to Dora Gamp where I remained until 1 came
o'	.	'	‘
to Bolsen on 9th April 1945.
2.	On 15th June 1945 1 was shown by Serjeant Seamans, 8b Special Investigation
Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whom I recognised as the Capo who was in
charge of Block 19 at Ellrich Camp. 1 have now been informed that his full
name is YL&DI&aV QSTROWOSKJ.
5*	After leaving Dora Gamp for Belsen Camp I spent two days at Ellrich
Camp, and it was then that 1 met the man 1 have referred to.	1‘he first day at
Dora 1 was one of 9 0 men of Block 19, who were ordered to sit in & squatting
position for four of five hours because one of the internees had excreted outside
the block. This punishment was given by OSTRO‘OSKl, who hit any prisoners who
moved or spoke with a soup ladle handle. He confined most of these beatings to
the very sick prisoners.	During the two days I was at Ellrich I saw OSTRO/fOSKl
beat many sick prisoners over the head with this same instrument. The heads of the
beaten prisoners were cut open and blood streamed from their wounds. On several
occasions I have had to remove bodies of persons who dies at Ellrich Camp because
of 'the beatings received from OSTECf /OSKI. 1 had seen OSTEO '0SK1 beat them. They
died the same day, I cannot remember their names.
4.	hilst I was at Belsen Camp I was again in Block 19, and OSTRO'OSKI was
a camp policeman. During this time I saw him beat many sick prisoners, mostly at
Ape11 times, for no reason at all. !hen prisoners lined up for food OSTRO/OaQ
went down the line of waiting men and beat and hit them. .gain it was mostly the
sick prisoners who took the punishment.	/5.......﻿One morning-, just after we arrived at Belsen, OSTRO/'OSKI called
pveryone out on Apell. One of the prisoners, 1 do not know his name but he
was a Frenchman, was so sick that he could not move. I saw 03THOW03CI hit
the Frenchman on the head with a soup ladle handle. I cannot say just what
injuries he recieved but his head was covered in blood. I later fcaw this
man's body dragged away by other prisoners and put on to a heap of dead bodies
outside the hut. I saw for myself that he was dead.

DE' OSITIOK Otf Vu/sDjlUfi SUbMA (fJt'ala) late of Nikolajo^r, Boleaja Morskaja dom 13,
Russia, sworn before Captain -«lexander ’laclcinlay b’orbes. Royal Artillery, Legal
Staff, No. 1 ar Crimes Investigation Tot®.
1.	I am 21 years of age and I was working in a factory at Nikolajow
when the Germans captured the to®n in January '< J42.,	1 was then arrested by
the Germans and put in prison at Nikolajow for about 12 months, after which I
was transferred to Buchenwald. after about a month there I was transferred to
Lora Camp where I remained until March	I was 'then moved to Eilrich Camp
for two days after which I came to Belsen.
2.	On '>5th June 1^45 I was shown by Serjeant Seamans, 8b Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a man whom I recognised as
the Capo of the block in which I lived at Dora Comp. I have now been informed
that his name is VLADISLAV 0STROw’OSLI.
3.	Whilst at Lora Camp I saw OSffiGWOSKI beat many prisoners every day.
The prisoners at Dora Camp, including myself, were compel ed to work on twelve
hour shifts, alternately on nights and days, underground. 'e had to dig a
\
deep tunnel there, for a factory, and the work was vary hard* OSTEONOSK.!
did not work in the tunnel but remained in the block all the time, ''hen we
finished work we returned to the block for food. OSTSOwOSKl frequently refused
to give many of us food and he did not give much to -the others. He never
distributed the food fairly so that many of the prisoners starved. Then
prisoners went to him to ask for food he beat them. Sometimes he beat them
with his hands, sometimes with a thick stick, somwtimes a big metal soup spoon
and he often kicked them whilst they were on the ground. OSTEOfOSiil delighted
in punishing prisoners and would not allow us to sleep during non-working hours,
•'hen we went to the block to rest he called Apells at all hoirs, sometimes at
3 and 4 o’clock in the morning aftervwe had been working all day, and sometimes
during the daytime when we had been on night shift. OSTRCWOSK.I worked on
behalf of the S.S. and took these ispeels on his own receiving special
considerations for doing so. He received drink and cogarettes from the S.S.
for the way in which he treated the prisoners. I saw this several times, but
cannot nameor describe the S.S. men. Many of the prisoners at Dora died through
over-work, undernourishment, lack of rest and beatings.﻿OSTKCWOSO waa responsible for this ill-treatment. I did not see Vrim actually
Jj.l.i any prisoner outright by beating them at Dora.
4-.	On transfer to Enrich concentration camp I ’.vas, for those two days,
in block 't9 of which OSTRO -OSiil was again the Capo. During those two days none
of us received any food and GSTaOWOSK.1 beat many prisoners as before.
5.	OSTHO'06111 moved to Belsen with us and we were placed in block 19
with OSTROiOSKI again the Capo. He continued to beat ahd ill-treat prisoners
in the sane way as before, about 4-.a.m. one morning, about three days after
we arrived in Belsen, OS'MOWOSKI ordered all of us out of the block on to apell.
One prisoner, a frenchman, was sick and unable to get up. I saw OSffiOWOSKI go
to the frenchman and give him a very heavy blow on the head with a piece of iron
which he was carrying. The blow smashed the Frenchman's head and smothered his
head and face in blood. He did not move again. I Saw that he was dead. Later
in the day the Frenchman's body, together with others who had died in the block
during the night, was carried out and put on a heap of dead bodies in the camp, I
assisted at this job. I am quite certain that the Frenchman was killed by the
brutal attack made on him by QSf&CWOSRE*
6.	I have been beaten myself by OS'fciU OSnl on a number of oocasiohs
both at Dora and Belsen. One day in Belsen when I was sick with Typhus, I asked
OSTHO /0SK1 for food. Instead of giving me any OSTWtOSK.1 beat me across the
shoulders with a stick.

DSEOSITIOH OS' PM'xiti IfArjCM (Male) late of Aldarkino, near Kuibisohow, Russia,
swom before Captain Alexander Mackinlay Rorbes, Royal artillery. Legal Staff,
No* 1 Mar Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 3^ years of age and served as a Signaller in the 497th Signals
Battalion of the Russian Army until I v&s taken prisoner by the Germans near
LUffil in September 194t. I later escaped and worked as a partisan until 1
was recaptured in September *944.	1 then passed through the following Labour
Camps in Germany - Halle, Torgau and Ralkenberg. I escaped again in June 1943
and was recaptured at Kattowita, Silesia, and taken to Auschwitz Concentration
Camp in July i943- I stayed there until November 1943 when I was transferred
tp Buchenwald where I stayed for a month. I then moved to Dora Camp and, 1
finally came to Belsen on 8th April '*945*
2.	On >5th June 1945 I was shown by Serjeant SC AMAHS, 86 Special
Investigation Section, Corps of Military °olice, a man whom I recognised as
a Capo whom I first met on the journey from Dora to Belsen. I have now been
informed that his name is VLADISLAV OSTROWOSKI.
3.	From Dora 1 was marched with other prisoners to a small camp about
nine kilometres away where we stayed the night. Th© following day we began
an eight day train journey to Belsen. e arrived at the small camp I have
mentioned about 5»P*m* on the first day of our journey. Many of the prisoners
were standing on the road passing through the small camp when the Capo, OSTROMOSK.I,
approached. He was carrying a very thick wooden stick about a yard long and
three inches thick. Upon reaching the prisoners in the road he began to beat
them indiscriminately with the stick. Altogether he beat between '• 5 an<1 ‘40
prisoners, knocking them to the ground by blows on the head and other parts of
the body. Some of the prisoners were rendered unconscious by the blows. I
saw all this happen and the beatings were completely unwarranted. OSTKO’MOSKI,
who is a strongly built man, proudly cleared a path for himself through the
group of prisoners by knocking them off the road with his stick. I cannot
say whether any of the victims were killed, but they were all injured by the blows.
4.	During the short period I was in Belsen Camp there was very little
«
, -1-﻿food distributed. Only twice did we get any food and that was a small quantity
j^soup. Together with other prisoners from Dora I was detailed to live in
Block 19, of which OSTkO/OSEI was Capo in charge. It was his responsibility to
distribute this soup. The prisoners were natural^ very hungry and, on both
occasions, rushed to get their soup. I saw O -TaU U ill, on .both occasions, bes.t
many of the hungry prisoners with the iron handle of a broken soup ladle. The
iron handle had sharp edges and OS'THOv.'ObKl beat prisoners across the head and
other parts of the body with it, causing severe injuries and bleeding. A
number of victims were rendered unconscious by these blows, but I cannot say
whether any of them died.
5.	On the morning of 15th April 1945 when British troops arrived at
the Camp, ODThOajiLI came into the block at about 5*15,a*®* ™he block was
over-crowded and I saw him walk across the sleeping bodies of the prisoners
not caring where he trod. He was again carrying the iron handle and he beat
prisoners with it as he walked through the block, shouting to them to get out
on Ape11. ' 'hen prisoners did get up he beat them with the iron handle as they
went out on to Apell. It was fairly dark at that tape and I could not see
what injuries were inflicted or if any of the prisoners were killed by the blows.
The dead and sick prisoners who were in the block had to be carried out on to
pell that morning.
6.	On the day before the camp was liberated I was told by another
Sussian prisoner, who left Belsen some weeks ago, that the Capo, OSTRO#8BJ,
had beaten a french prisoner to death in his block. I did not see the incident
myself. I did not sleep every night in block 19> as it was too over-crowded,
and therefore I cannot say all that happened in block 19.

IN THE MATTER OF WAR CRIMES
AND
BEATING-S AT VARIOUS CONCENTRATION G3SPS
DEPOSITION OF MARTIN HOLLANDER (Male) late of 39 Velka Muzijbva, Czechoslovalda-,
swom before Major SAVILE GEOFFREY CHAM1I0N, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age and on 21st February 1944 I was called up for
service in the Hungarian Amy and put into an unarmed working battalion. On
h
24th May 1944, with all other Jews, I was discharged. I was put in prison at
Szeged for one day and then taken to Berkenau camp Where I remained until 29th
May 192(4-, when I was transferred to Fallersleded camp. At the end of June 1944
I was taken to Thil camp, near Longwy, France and remained there unto the end of
August 1944 when I wan transferred to Demo camp. At the end of September 1944
I was sent to Dora camp and x'emained there until I was transferred to Belsen. I
arrived at Belsen camp on 13th April 1945*
2.	I identify No. 2 on photograph 1 as an SS man at Dora Camp., I
have now been told that his full name is THEODORE WAGNER. Just before I left
Dora camp there was a parade and I saw 2(0 people on that parade beaten and
kicked by WAGNER. The people who fell to the ground he kicked in the back
and stomack. I was one who was beaten. WAGNER carried out the beating
with a rubber truncheon and beat me so badly on the head ana body that I was
deaf in my right ear for three weeks. On the Sunday following this ihcodent
I saw another 76 people who were on parade beaten by WAGNER. He never gave
any reason for these beatings and so far as I know there was none. I cannot
say if any of these people who were beaten were seriously hurt.
3.	I June 1944, while I was at Fallersleded camp, I saw an SS Oberschar-
fuhrer named RIESEL beat a Rumanian Jew named Loudon aged about 50 years. He
used a rubber truncheon. After the beating I saw that the Jew was bleeding
from the mouth. He was removed to Hospital where he was detained for a week.
The reason for this beating was that the Jew was noisy at meals. An internee
Doctor, whose name was JAEGER, and who worked in the hospital where this Jew
had been sent, told me that the Jew would never recover from the beating he
had received from RIBSLE. After I arrived at Thil camp I was told by a
prisoner, I do not know his name, that RIESEL had again beaten this Roumanian﻿Jew and that he had been admitted to Hospital. At the end of August, after
the camp had moved to Demo, I happened to visit the Hospital and saw the
Rumanian Jew there. About six weeks after the camp had moved to Dora it
was officially announced by the SS that the Rumanian Jew had died.
I would describe RIESEL as aged about 35 years, height 6ft., v/eight 80 kilos,
straight broen hair, dark eyes, fresh complexion, round face, clean shaven,
carried himself very erect, slim build, very handsome.

were standing near the kitchen near Block 8? in Canp 2 at IELS2H. I saw a
group of about 8 prisoners standing near the kitchen about 15 metres frm
where we were and suddenly WASIEH came out of the kitchen, picked up a spade
and began to hit the mn* The rasa all ran away except one, who was about
30 years old, who fell to the ground. The SS man continued to hit the raan
vdtfa the spade as hard as he could* After -,he SS man Imd stopped hitting
the man he was lying quite still on tte ground and I could see that half his
face had been smshed in. I tom saw the SS raen call two prisoners and they
took toe body to me of the pits where toe dead were always put* JUst at
that time the Commandant of BEL SEN Gasp 2, who was an Bauptstunsfubrer as tar
as I can remember, arrived on toe scene. 1 overheard the SS man tell him
that he had killed a raan. WAG8E& was sseking at the time sm laughing as
he told this to the Canp Commandant*

he had to be on guard. He was a mechanic and was sometimes on duty at the
workshop where repairs vrere carried out on motor vehicles* /SIGNER had nothing
to do with the administration of the Camp. His rank was "Stunmann"(private).
When I saw him at Belsen he held the same rank but had changed his coat to
Wehmnacht. I am surprised to hear that WAGNER is a Hauptscharfuhrer because
he was a. Rumanian and could scarcely speak German. KRAMER was Camp Commandt. of
Belsen, If KRAMER says that WAGNER was Hauptscharfuhrer in charge of administration
at Belsen I am of opinion that he, KRAMER, is lying or he is referring to some
other man. WAGNER had only been with the SS for two years and could not
possibly have attained the rank of Hauptscharfuhrer. I have never seen
WAGNER beating prisoners nor have I heard of it.﻿﻿MESSAGE POEM

permanent home is KOZENICZ, POKJ®. I ara at present living at Blools; RD 6,
Room 29, HOHNE (BELSEN) Oairp, GEIiLUY.
1.	^n the summer of 1941 I was arrested, being a Jew, and taken to
YfOLANOV, POUIND, where I remained until the summer of 1942 then being
transferred to STARCHOFITZ, POKu®, At the beginning of 1943 I was sent to
the nUSCHSiTZ Concentration Camp and stayed there until the beginning of
1944, when I was taken to NOEDH/iUSEN. In March 1945 I was sent to the
HELSEN Concentration Camp and I stayed there until the Camp-was liberated
by the British.
2.	I have been shown various photographs and I have picked out Ho,2 on.
Photograph No.1 as being the person to whom I refer in my deposition. I
am now told his name is THEODOR LACKER, A ROUblANIAN.
3.	One day, about a week before the arrival of British troops at BELSEN,
we vvefe queuing for food outside our canteen in Carp 2. I saw WAGNER approach
and pick Up a spade which was lying close to the cookhouse. He came towards
us and started hitting out wildly with this spade and I saw one man, whom he
had hit over the head, sink to the ground bleeding profusely from a big gash
in his head, I then ran to one of the blocks bordering the square and watched
from a window, I saw the Camp Commandant approach WAGNER and speak to him and
I saw WAGNER grin broadly. Later I saw two prisoners carry away the man, who
had not moved since he had been struck, and took him to a pile of dead bodies.
I was told later, by people who had heard the conversation, that the Camp
Commandant asked WAGNER what was the matter, 'WAGNER told him that he had just
killed a man.
4«	I also recognise No.6 on Photograph No,3 as an SS man who was the
supervisor in the parcel office at NOHDBAUSEN. I did not know his name but
I am now told that it is JOHANN BESEMER.
5»	This office was responsible for the distribution of Red Cross parcels
but none were ever received by the prisoners. Sometimes prisoners went to
the office to enquire whether they could have something to eat. Then
BESEMER crane and hit them or threw a stone at them.

am now tola that it is Theodor AAGNER.
3.	about 8 days before the liberation I witnessed the following incident.
There wore a number of people on the square by the cookhouse in Carp 2, when
suddenly I saw W4GNER appear and pick-up a spade which was lying on the ground.
TP„IStarte^.f^nnins ^0wards several people screaming wild curses against the
of "aboS S ^ ^ mtn hlS SpadS at anyone within reach. I saw one man
t'-3?-yea^S °f ase’ who 1 laievf t0'be a Polish Jew, fall to the ground.
wf? °0ntinTUed t0uh;Lt the Illan Unti;L he was dead* 1 know that the man was
dead because I saw him being carried to the mass grave near the sick bay*
The man was carried there by two prisoners on WAGNER* s orders. However
w	C10rprse was carrit3I ’away the Lager commandant approached and I
.J?	aSk	»hat the trouble was. I heard WAGNER say that he had
just killed a man, the commandant then walked away.
4*. Quite apart from the above incident I have often seen WAGNER beat
prisoners with whatever he carried at the time, sometimes it was a whip
sometimes a stick or my odd piece of wood. Often these people were
severely bruised and bleeding after the beating';,

1*	I was aircsted by the Germans at my hone in January 1940, because I am
Jewish, and was taken to the Ghetto at Y/OLANOV with my parents who were later
killed by the Germans.	In January 1941 I was taken to the Labour Damp at
YfOLAHOV and at this Camp I was sent out to work as a farm hand.- I remained
there until May 1943 when I was sent to the BLIZIN .Concentration Gamp.
In August 1944 I was taken to the AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp and from there,
in January 1945 to the GIEPWITZ Concentration Camp and one week later to the
DORA Concentration Camp near NOKDHAUSEN. In early April 1 945 I was sent to
the BELSEN Concentration Camp where I was liberated by the British on 15th
■april 1945*
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs and of the persons
shown on these photo raphs I recognise No.2 on Photograph 1 as an SS man who
was at the BELSEN Concentration Camp at the same time as myself. I did not
know his name but I am now told that it is THEODOR YiAGNER.
3«	About a week before we were liberated I and another three boys were
standing near the kitchen near Block 87 in Camp 2 at BELSEN, I saw a group
of about 8 prisoners standing near the kitchen about 15 metres from where we were
and suddenly li'iSHSS1” “came out of the kitchen, picked up a spade and began to hit
the men. The men all ran away except one,'who was about 30 years old, who fell
to the ground. The SS man continued to hit the man with the spade as hard as
he could. After the SS man had stopped hitting the man he was lying quite
still on the ground and I could see that half his face had been smashed in.
I then saw the SS men call two, prisoners and they took the body to one of the
pits where the dead were always put. Just at that time the Commandant of
BELSEN Camp 2, who was an Hauptsturmfuhrer as far as I can remember, arrived
on the scene.:	j overheard the SS man tell him that he had killed a man,
WAGNER was smoking at the time and laughing as he told this to the Camp
Commandant#
4*	I saw WAGNER again two or three days after our liberation. He was
outside the temporary Review in Camp 2 with a Red Cross car carrying straw:
sack's under the supervision of the British and he then told me, in German,
that he was' a Roumanian. He also spoke ■ to some Roumanian ox-prisoners in
a language I did not understand.

2.	On 3 June 1944 I was arrested by the German's at St. Helier and taken
to the JACQUE CARTIER Prison near RHEIMS, France. I stayed there about
a week when I was taken with other prisoners to BELFORT.^ I stayed
there about fourteen days. From there I was sent to NEOERGAMME
Concentration Gamp, arriving there about the beginning of September. ul
was next taken to WILHELMSHAVEN where I stayed until the 2nd April 194b.
On that day I and several hundred other prisoners were sent to BELSEN
Concentration Gamp, arriving there after a few days journey.
3.	On arriving at BELSEN we were offered some soup in exchange for
either bread or cigarettes and only those prisoners who could give up
some bread or cigarettes were able to obtain soup. «e were taken to
our blocks. I was in block 12. The whole camp was grossly^overcrowded
and at night six hundred of us were locked in a. hut which might
accommodated one hundred. There was» not sufficient room,to lie down
and we had to spend .the night sitting up and.jammed up against each other.
At least eight or nine prisoners died each night. A11 ohe internees
in my block were men, mostly Russians and Poles with some irench and
a mixture of other European races.
4.	At 3-30 a.m. we had to get up and. go on Appel-parade-where we
had to stand to attention until 8 a.m. we were.then.formed into parties
of five and started, dragging corpses to the burial pits. There were,
thousands of corpses lying in hepp's almost all over the camp.

2.	On 15th ^pril 1945, ip the early afternoon, I entered BELSEN Gamp
under the terms of the Truce of that day’s date, in my capacity as Deputy
Director of Medical Services, Second, ^rmy,
3.	^ At approximately 1800 hours on the afternoon of 15th April 1945 I
was interrogating JOSEF-KRaMER,Commandant of BELSEN Gamp, in company
with Lieutenant-colonel Richard Taylor,D .S .0 ., Royal Artillery, Command-
ing 63rd Anti-lank Regiment, Royal Artillery, a Battery of which Regt
provided, the first British troops to. do duty in BELSEN Gamp.
4.	At about this time a runner came to report shooting by SS annrd.q ||
at tfre Western end of the Men’s' Gamp. I pro ceedexl immediately 'tothe *
spot in company with Lieutenant-colonel Taylor, taking JOSEF KRAMER
with us.
-5.	^ At the Western end of the Men’s Gamp, some thirty yards due Dast
of the Gate leading thence to the crematorium, I found, a stack of straw,
covered potato plants . A number of male internees of the Gamp were
foraging in the stack for food. Surrounding them were three or four
i^KiiyiHual members pf—the—SS-^_Guards dT the Gamp armed with automatic
weapons of gten Gun type.	I ITpprTjalJheiLjth-eiEan-Qt I saw and hea?d~M-.hem

prevent_them__or to -Lrumrfdrc .-------- --------------
6. ^ Such firing was indiscriminate and gave the impression of being
a customary pa&ime. Several dead and dying internees were lying on
and around the potato stack> I saw one or two fall as a result of the
firing as I approached. I am unable to identify the SS Guards respons-
ible _ for the firing but have been shown photographs of the S3 Guards
now in our custody and No,3 on photograph 24, whose name I am Informed
is STEPHAN KONRAD., appears to me . to resemble strongly one of the Guards
involved.
T •	gave immediate orders to KRAMER that all shooting at internees
was to cease immediately, and. that any further case reported to us
would result in one SS Guard, being shot for every interee killed. I
also directed that the dead and wounded be removed for burial and
medical attention respectively, -^t least one of the dead was carried,
away on my orders by JOSEF KRAMER, who showed the utmost reluctance to
comply with the order.
8.	Despite my orders single shots were to be. heard around the
perimeter of the Gamp, some of which may have come from the Guard,
towers, during the next 16 to 18 hours.
9,	I formed the strongest impression that such shooting at internees
was a popular sport among the Guards for no adequate reason since I am
convinced that no attempts to escape were made after the British
occupation commenced, A further repetition of orders to shoot one for
one was necessary before this could finally be stopped.

10 •	the 16th ^pril 1945 it was reported to rae that some of the
Hungarian soldiers employed as guards by the SS had broken into and
looted the food stores.. It was further reported that food sent by
charitable organisations., principally Jewish, for the use of
internees, was customarily regarded as the perquisite of the-guards
I issued, stringent orders to the Hungarians in this regard and no
further such looting was reported.
11. In regard to the generally deplorable condition of the
and my report above referred, to, it is my considered opinion that
such conditions were the result of gross negligence and criminal
lack of care on the part of the Gamp staff over a period certainly
not less than twelve weeks, In my opinion it is inconceivable
that the state of affairs existing on ISth ^pril 1945 could have
been attained in any less time.

GENERAL SURVhY Oh BELSEN CONCENTRATION CaMP .
This Concentration Camp consists of two areas, one (Camp 1) a hutted
camp made up of 5 Main Compounds, divided by wire, and an enclosure
containing■administrative huts, all enclosed in a wired-in perimeter. In
addition to this a certain portion of the neighbouring barracks area had
quite recently been taken over as Camp 2 for the reception of 16,000
male persons who had arrived from other camps. Owing to the better
qccommodation and facilities, and their recent arrival, these prisoners
¥/ere in much better condition that those in Camp .1 .
Camp 1. For plan of Camp, 1, see Appendix 'B1.
Living Accommodation. This Camp consists of 5 Compounds, 3 for men
and two for women.
The total number of prisoners was given to me on 16 ^pr 45 as :~
Women	- _ 28,185
Men	-	12,000 (Approx).
The sizes of these Compounds varies considerably; in the case of the
men, containing from approx 1,500. to 8,-000 and the two women's enclosures
(No.l) 23,000 and (No.2) approx, 5,000. In the former was one enclosure
said to hold approx 500 children. In both mends and women's compounds
conditions in the huts varied, considerably, some being bunked with 2 -3
tiered, bunks,whilst in others the prisoners just lay crowded, together
on the floor, Except In men's compound. No.3, there were certain huts
set aside for use as hospital huts,but,except In one of the men's
compounds and in the large women's enclosure, these were quite
inadequate. They were not even all bunked as the following figures will
show,
Vtfomen1s Compounds, Number of prisoners acutely ill suffering from'
definite diseases exclusive of malnutrition was approx 2,000 and
for these there were only 474 bunks. In consequence each was ocpupied
by 2 or 3 women, the remainder, Including practically all typhus
patients, just lying ohthe bare boards. In Compound No.2 there was
one hut only set aside as a hospital hut, and this was iplthout any beds.
In this compound typhus patients were not- segregated.
Men1s Compound , Hospital conditions in these compounds were not
as good -as those in the Women's compounds, although there were
rather more bunks. 1959 for 2242 acutely ill. In compound No.3 no
huts at all had been set aside.
Up to the time of their liberation it is understood, that all
personnel had been strictly confined to their particular compound
and there was no mixing at all.
Cookhouses. There were 5 cookhouses within the precincts of Gamp
No.l. Two for men, two for women and one mixed cookhouse. Their
sizes varied, but in the majority of cases 2 to 3 cookings had to
be done for each meal.
The number of meals varied/from 2 to 3 per diem and
consisted only of a soup of vegetables, mainly carrots, dried
cabbage and. potatoes, thickened, wit^i. meal. Very occasionally small
amounts of meat were added.
Water. o'here were two or three small concrete ponds within
the camp Wrom which prisoners could draw water, but as practically
all supplies were dependent upon electrical pumping there had been
no water at all for several days owing to the cables.being cut.
Crematorium nt the bottom end of the camp was a crematorium
consisting* of one oven which apparently had not been used, for some﻿4
56
time as the number of deaths had been increasingt ' at too rapid a
rafea. In the neighbourhood of this building judging by the earth
r4B|nbly turned over had obviously been several graves of the mass
pjp variety and this was confirmed by the Commandant. On the
South side of the Camp was a large pit approx 25 yds x 8-yds x 4 yds
in which were a considerable number of blackened corpses.
Prison Cells. -One building was set aside, consisting' of bare
prison cel&s.
Administrative -area outs ide the Main Prison Compounds , I his
consisted of a main Office building and' living huts around for
Guards and administrative personnel. In addition was a small build-
ing with a few ablutioh benches and a larger containing 4 big
disinfestation chambers, each capable of d.oing 60 sets ol clothing
in l^ hours. In this latter building were 15 -shower baths.
Latrines. These were practically non-existent and where there
were any consisted of a bare pole over a pit, without any screen-
ing whatsoever.
Gamp No .2. This had only very recently been formed (about -a week) by
takim over a portion of the Barrack area. Accommodation here was
naturally very much better but all the buildings were grossly overcrowd-
ed and had of course got already in a filthy condition. However, the
majority of the inmates were in moderately good condition,, and ^ there was
no record of’ any cases of Typhus, The prisoners were divided into
barrack blocks by nationalities which made supervision considerably
easier. One block had been set aside as a Hospital.
Barrack area. > Adjoining these 2 Camps and a • continuation
of Gamp No .2. was a most magnificent barrack area with every possible-
facility - good canteens, cookhouses, excellent garages and stabling,
a cinema, good married quarters and a beautiful Officers' Mess.
In this barrack block area were 8 hospital
blocks housing at the time they were seen 604 German Military patients,
whilst in beautiful surroundings just beyond the^officers1 mess
was an excellently appointed Military Hospital of 500 beds.

15th April
45.
JOSEPH KRAMER ( Commandant) was interviewed^'by Lt.Col Taylor,
DSO (Allied Military Commander) and myself and whilst this was being
carried out there was the sound ox intermittent small arms fire but
no indication that this was within the camp area. However, a runner
arrived to say that there was rioting at the Central Cookhouse.
On arrival there everything seemed quiet, but one S3 man stated
that there had been stealing of soup. '-There was no evidence of
this. Rifle fire continued to be heard., this time near at hand.,
and on proceeding through the - camp, SS Guards were found to be .
shooting prisoners who in their hungry condition were endeavouring
to remove potatoes from a pile near the cookhouse.
Commandant KRAMER made no attempt to stop his men and it
was only on a threat to shoot the SS-personnel immediately, ona
basis of one for one, should any further killing take place that
the situation became quiet. Neither Commandant KRaMER nor any ox
personel made any attempt to succour the wounded and dyin^,
to remove the dead. An order was given to this effect and
Commandant himself made to assist.
There was naturally considerable excitement amongst^
prisoner® who were thronging the Central road outside their
his
nor
the
the
Compounds. Their welcome was
exuberant, but at that time
absolutely orderly, and although It was extremely difficult to
induce them to return within their compounds, this was eventually
A detachment was left within the camp to maintain order
and tanks -positioned near the main food store. Instructions were
p-iven also to all enemy guards that unless there was any mass

During the attempt to peacefully persuade the inmates to return to

appalling. Numerous dead bodies were seen which could not have
resulted from the recent shooting, one inmate reported that the
huts too contained large numbers of corpses sharing the accomm-
odation with the living.
= Mayy of the inmates talked to were' obviously well bred and
\n£111Pnt• Their condition was pitiable in the extreme and
although many stories of their hardships were told it in no way
prepared one lor the indescribable horrors seen on the following
day.	■	-	to.
AP^i:)-y At 0830 hrs a rapid tour of the whole area of both Cano 1
, ^nd bamp 2„waB arranged and during' this a prepared statement was
broadcast in four languages to all prisoners , announcing that
German control of the Gamp was at an end and 'had been taken over
by the British forces. The inmates were promised help of all kinds
and exhorted to remain quiet so that the efforts of the troops to
aid them could be facilitated4
The Commandant KRAMER, in a Jeep and guarded by CMP's, was •
instructed to lead the way to the Crematorium and asked whether
there were any open graves. He without shame led the way to the
pit referred to above, which contained large numbers of blackened
corpses and on the way two large piles of naked corpses, all mere
skeletons were passed. Each pile must have contained well over a
100 bodies of meh who must have died within the last dew: days.
It was iouna that these inmates had only recently been moved to
BELSEN and to accommodate them certain of the barrack Blocks
had been taken over.﻿58. '
^ On completion of this tour and, following a conference, a more
detailed inspection of Gamp No,1 was commenced, a large proportion
of tha ordinary living huts and all so called Hospital accmmodation was
mspc^^ed in detail,
conditions were much the same in all compounds there were
certain general points arising in each.
Mens’ Compounds.
No .1,
No ,2.
No . 3 .
Women1s
Typhus was on the wane and. reached its peak in March. It is
understood that It commenced early in February.
This was^the largest men's compound'and contained approx
8,000. Typhus had commenced here at a!later date than in
Compound 1 and had now reached Its peak. There were 266
cases and new cases were still occurring, but the medical
member-s considered that the worst was over. It was in this
Compound that the story of cannibalism was reported to me
by one of the doctors.
There had been none for the last 2. days but before that
there had. been many cases .
There were many fewer inmates.in this compound and no hut
set aside as a hospital.
Conditions in many of the huts were indescribable, several
dead bodies could be seen, in some cases moved up to the
ends, in others left just as they lay. Only by entering
the huts could the cases of extreme emaciation be seen,
so many obviously past any help however skilled.
The gutters outside the huts contained living and dead. There
was no attempt at sanitation whatsoever, the men just
squatting anywhere.
Compounds .
This was a very large compound containing approximately
23,000. Conditions here weremuch the same as in the men’s
compounds except that in a greater proportion there had
been attempts to preserve order and some semblance of
cleanliness. Theredid seem however to me more.cases of
extreme emaciation amongst the women than the men and in
hut 208 conditions were appalling. Practically every inmate
was so weak that they could hardly raise themselves and
the passage was equally crowded with both living and dead.
Not so many dead bodies were left for any length of time
in the huts or surroundings but In the middle of the
compound and practically adjoining the children’s area
was a vars large area of naked women piled high. It must
have contained many hundreds.
The hospital block in this compound was a paradise
compared to any others and I can’t speak too highly of
the efforts of certain of the women doctors. One woman
Gynaecologist was .conducting all the obstetric cases,
averaging 5 to 7 per day, and for some days without any
water supply available.
The care that had been taken of the children was also
most noticeable.
In this compound,however, the number of bunks available
for Hospital cases was grossly inadequate. 474 for a total
of approx 2,000 acutely Ill, In many cases there were 3
in each bunk and the condition In the Typhus ward where
there were no bunks at all was indescribable. The same
applied to the men’s compound. The typhus in this compound
was well segregated and was definitely on the wane. There
Were approx 250 cases here. Out of the 23,000 Inmates of
the compound medical personnel estimated that there were
not more than 5,000 well.﻿-7-

Clothlnp;.
Food
No.2,	In this compound	4_,500 women. Only one hut
was set aside as a Hospital and this had no hunks In it.
There was no segregation of typhus, of which there were
300 cases ,
Medical Supplies. These were supplied from a central store in the
administrative block. The medical personnel said that
drugs and dressings were available but very frequently
not those most necessary. Dressings had been very short.
No vaccines were available nor any form of anti-louse
powder for the control of typhus. No disinfectants were
available.
When the Medical Stores were inspected certain Red
Gross boxes were found containing tinned milk,meats, etc.
It was explained that these were part of a very large
stock sent by Jewish Societies for Jews. These had been
stolen by the German Guards and none issued, except
very occasionally a small Issue of sweets to the
children.
Only in those who had obviously been In a short time
was clothing adequea be. Large numbers were in German
Hospital clothing. The'fact that all corpses were placed
in piles naked was, I think,due to the fact that bodies
were stripped to see if any better articles of clothing
could be obtained.
The meals consisted entirely of soup made with meal
or flour and vegetables, mainly carrots, dried cabbage,
potatoes, turnips, etc. with a very occasional and scanty
sprinkling of small cubes of meat. The method of
distribution was by galvanised containers carried from
the kitchens to' the various blocks by the prisoners
themselves. It Is obvious therefore that no equality of
distributiomhould even be organised ahd the moment anyone
became too weak to fend for himself the chance of obtain-
ing any food became more and more remote.
There had been none for days owing to the failure of
the electricity. It was pitiable to see both men and
women standing naked In their compounds endeavouring to
keep themselves clean from a teacupful of water.
In this camp there could be no shame and no sex.
' Control..
There were certain individuals, one per block, appointed
as block leaders. They were, I supposed, to keep order and organise
the general administration Including feeding arrangements for their
respective blocks. All signals were made by whistle,

6. PRELIMINARY MEASURES TAKEN TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS.
By the afternoon of the first day (16th) 27 watercarts were
provided by 8 Corps, and a supply of food in tins for the evening meal.
All initial supplies had obviously to be carefully guarded and Issue
supervised.
The psychological effect of this provision was amaxing, and each
day the atmosphere in the camp has improved, changing from one of.
extreme apathy through the gradual appearance of a spark of vitality
to real joy and an interest in life. The magnitude of the Medical
problem In the supervision of special feeding and supervision .of
feeding for those cases of starvation cannot be o-ver-estimated. oteps
have already been taken to provide .a special gastric diet for these
cases and an attempt to mobilise helpers to ensure that the weakest are
fed, until such time as they can be moved to a new hospital area.
General Policy.
(a)	The complete evacuation of Camp 1 and I hope Its destruction
' by fire.
(b)	The establishment of a transit area in the present
administrative building which includes the preisent bath-
house and disinfestors . Through this will be passed all
inmates who are well, and they will be dusted with AL 63
plus bathing where possible.
(c)	Camp 2 will be evacuated immediately of all fit personnel
who" will be removed either to D.P . Camps or accommodation
in the Barrack area. There have been no cases of Typhus In this
Camp.	•
(d)	The fit and well in Camp 1 will be bathed, dusted and issued
with new clothing where necessary and evacuated to the far
end of the Barrack area.
(d) An area of the barrack blocks (8 of which contained German
Military wounded) has been evacuated either to neighbouring-
German Hospitals or in the cu.se of the Hungarian Guard, to
other accommodation; this will be 'set aside as a hospital
area and all acutely ill removed immediately to this
location, passing through a reception area en route. The
cases of malnutrition and. starvation will also be passed
through a reception area where they.can be carefully examinee
and passed to the appropriate destination. The German
Officers' Mess has been taken over for the reception of.
the worst cases of starvation not suffering from communicable
infectious dis.ease. These will be, nursed by British
Nursing Officers.-
Nursing in the main hospital area v/Ill be carricci. out utiuer
the supervision,of British male personnel by Prisoner
Medical Officers and nurses assisted by German.Nurses mobilised
for the purpose. Large numbers can be made* available.
—^	1 ~ (q) The following medical units were moved m on the 17 Apr.
One GGS
One Lig&t Field Ambulance
Two Field Hygiene Sections (one came In on
first day)
One mobile Bact. Lab.﻿- 9 -	61.
Immediately	the first detailed inspection,
requests were made for
Protective clothing.
Large quantities of Suphaguanidine.
Welfare facilities to be put in train
including provision of Postal facilities.
Papers to be ready as soon as required.
Help from UNHRA teams if possible of '
varied nationalities and Red Cross teams.
Visit of Members of Typhus Commission.
Large stores of captured German drugs and dressings
will be made available.
All forms of clothing and ordnance stores were
demanded and where possible will be provided from
captured German stock. Large quantities are already
on the way. Women's clothing will probably have to
be demanded from German civilian sources,
nil food of a luxury nature and suitable for the
special feeding of these patients was impounded, from
the local Hosp stores and arrangements will be made
for resupply of eggs, milk and butter from the
surrounding districts.
1.	It is unnecessary to enlarge on the horrors of the
Concentration Camp. Nothing like it has ever been seen by anyone who has
yet visited the Camp, and the photographs attached as Appx 'C fail to
reproduce the worst horrors which could only be appreciated by seeing
the* inside of the worst huts.
.	2.	The Camp No.l will be evacuated completely, priority being
given to the acutely ill and the fit and well whose removal can proceed
simultaneously. Next will leave those suffering from malnutrition
with a reasonable expectation of survival, and finally the whole
community. During this period supervised feeding will take place of all
those in Camp 1 awaiting removal. It is considered' that this will
give the greatest chance and expectation of life to the greatest number.
3.	All protective measures are being taken and extra help
demanded. Typhus inoculation will be carried out on all those requiring
it and the necessary period of quarantine imposed.
Should Bacteriological examination prove the presence of
Typhoid to any extent inoculation by TAB will be considered if supplies
are available.
4.	The original estimate of the number of cases of Typhus
1,500 was probably too high. The actual figure is probably' between
900 - 1,000.
This comprises a preliminary report on the conditions
existing at the time of liberation and is based on continuous
observation throughout the first 4 days .	■«- further report will, be
rendered when more accurate statistics should be.available.

Exhibit No. 546
of
Major Frank Peter GAOLA.
Deposition on oath of Major Frank Peter GAOLA, Royal Artillery, of No.l
War Grimes Investigation 'i’eam, sworn before' Dieutenant-Colonel Thomas-
Humphrey TILLING, H0yal Artillery, No .1 War Crimes Investigation Team
at HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp,'GERMANY, on 24th January 1946,
1, No.l War Grimes Investigation Team has for some time past been
engaged in collecting evidence at HOHNE (BELSEN) Gamp from ex-prisoners
of various Concentration Camps.	.	. .
2.	HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp is a large Camp occupied by approximately
15,000 Displaced Persons of various nationalities, amongst these are
many former prisoners of BELSEN Concentration Camp, and a large number
of cx-prisoners who were formerly in one or more of the other Concentrat-
ion Camps set up by the Germans. These persons have been able to give
valuable evidence regarding the conditions in such Camps.
3.	During the past three months this Team has taken sworn statements'
from approximate! y 200 witnesses at HOHNE Camp and in cases, where a
witness has made specific allegations against former personnel of a
Concentration Camp it has not always been possible to obtain personal
identification of the accused even though the accused is in custody.
This is chiefly due to the fact that the majority of the accused persons
are located in one or other of the 8 C.I.Cs whlch are spread over the
British Zone and time has not permitted tie taking of individual witnesses
to the G.I.G's for the such purpose. In these circumstances the methods
described in the following paragraphs h -ve been used for identifying the
persons referred to in statements taken by personnel of this Team.
4.	Upon contact being made with a witness who wished to make
allegations against a named person, he or she would be shown a large
number of photographs of cx-concentration camp personnel and amongst
which would be a photograph of the p-rson named by the witness. The
book now produced to me marked FPC/1, was chiefly used for this purpose
although in some instances the witnesses were shown a number of Idose
photographs similar to those contained In this book. For the purpose
of reference each photograph was given a serial number. In some cases
this serial number appears on the face of the photograph but otherwise
the photographs were unmarked. The witness would be asked to select
the photograph of the person named, and if such selection was correct
this was taken as sufficient identification and a statement would then
be taken from the witness and the serial number of the photograph
referred to in the witness’ statement would be the number of the
photograph so selected.
5.	In cases where a witness was unable to name a person but was able
to Identify a photograph as being that of a person against whom he or
she wished to give evidence, the identification was checked by asking
questions of the witness regarding' the nature of the duties, rank,
former location, the dates on which the person concerned was alleged to
have been at such location etc, and provided that the witness' answers
agreed with the. history of the person concerned, this was accepted
as sufficient identification.
6.	With regard to the photographs in series FC/l to FC/l6,
inclusive, contained in exhibit FPC/l, it will be seen that these
photographs each show throe persons and for the purpose of witnesses
statements,the person shown on the left if such photographs is referred
to as No.l, the person In the centre Uo.2 and the person on the right as
No. 3. In other cases where more than one person appears on a
photograph, thevpersons shown are numbered from left "to right starting
cont﻿2
with the number 1.

DEPOSITION OP REGINA JAKUBOWICZ (Pemale) late of Petrikaxi, Stara Walsavska, Str 7,
sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Genn, Royal Artillery, Commanding,
No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 27 years of age and am a Polish Jewess. I was confined to
Petrikau Ghetto by the Gestapo in October 1942 and remained there until October
or November 1944 when I was sent to Ravensbruk Concentration Camp. I came to
Belsen in February 1945.
2.	On 22nd June 1945, at Belsen, I saw a man whom I recognized as a Camp
Policeman at Petrikau Ghetto. I knew him by the name of LEVI and have now been
told that his full name is JONAS LEVI. I identify him as being No. 31 on
photograph 2/5/
3.	Petrikau Ghetto was administered by a Chief Jew named WARSAVSKI -who
took and carried out the orders of the S.S. LEVI used to carry out tne orders
of WARSAVSKI while at Petrikau Ghetto. I have often heard people say very

been told that his full name is JONAS LEVI. I identify him as being No. 31
on photograph Z/5/6.
3.	LEVI carried out the orders of the Chief Jew of the Ghetto whose
name was, WARSZAVSKI. I have never heard of or seen LEVI doing anything wrong.
He is a good man. I remember that in the winter of 1944 I was ordered to go
to the Synagogue and to take with me my little daughter Manor. My daughter
and I went to the Synagogue and whilst we were awaiting the transport to take
us to another camp LEVI came along and called us out. ¥6 did not go from
the Ghetto in that transport. I cannot say why LEVI did this for me. I did
not have to give him or anyone else any money or valuables for doing this.

DEPOSITION OP LEON BENCZKOWSKI (Male) late of Petrikau, Pilsudski StB. 1., Poland
sworn before Captain RONALD PERCY BENTHAM-GREEN, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff,
No, 1 War Crimes Investigation Team,
1.	I am 18 years of age and a Polish Jew. I lived with try brother ISRAEL
BENCZKOWSKI who was boro on 1st January 1925, in Petrikau. % Mother and
Father died in 192(1 in a very short time of each other. ly brother and I were
confined to Petrikau when it was made into a Ghetto by the Germans in the late
summer of 192(2. I was sent to Troppau Labour Camp in September 192(4 and then
to Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp in December 192(4 and finally to Belsen in
February 192(-5.
2.	in the Ghetto at Petrikau there was a Ghetto Policeman whom I knew
as ‘LEVY* . I recognize him as No. 51 on photograph 2/5/6 and I now know that
his full name is JONAS LEVI. He was the leader of thirteen special policeman
at the Ghetto. He spied on the internees and gave information to the Gestapo.
He also acted under the orders of WARSZAVSKI who was the Jewish President of
the Ghetto.
3.	Some time in January or February 1945 I was in ny room with ny
brother ISRAEL when LEVI came in and ordered ny brother to go to the Synagogue
to await transportation. % brother knew that this would probably mean that
he would be taken away and shot. He refused to go and LEVI hit him on the
head with a weapon which all the Jewish Policemen carried and which was made
of leather filled with bits of metal and sand. My brother fell to the ground
unconscious. LEVI threw some water over him and when he regained consciousness
he took him by the hand and led him away. I have never seen ny brother since.
4.	About three weeks after ny brother was taken away I was lying in the
sun on the roof of ny house. LEVI saw me and called me down and as I got down
I tried to run away but he hit me several times on the head with his weapon
and I fell to the ground. He then kicked me several times in the stomach.
I remembered no more for some time but when I had come round LEVI took me to
the Chief of the Jewish Police whose name was TEEDELBAUM. LEVI told TEIDSLBAHM
that I had tried to run away from him and he had beaten me. Nothing happened

Chief Jew at PETRIKAU. I cannot remember the name of the Chief Jew.
On one occasion I was ordered tO' go to the Synagogue with my daughter
to await transportation to another camp. On arrival I begged LEVI
to allow us to*go away, which he did. Many others also begged him.to
let them go, but so far as I know, we were the only ones freed by him.
I did not at any time give LEVI any money or valuables as a reward for
doing this, nor have I ever rewarded any other person who may have been
responsible for keeping me at the Ghetto. I did offer LEVI my watch
out" of gratitude, but he refused to take anything. A.s far as I know
LEVI is a good man and I have never heard any prisoners say anything
against him. I cannot sajr that he may not have done harm to some,
but I cannot believe that he is other than a good man from my know-

Concentration Camp where we remained for about 2 months. I was then sent alone
to Bel sen in January 1945. My mother went to Ravensbruck Concentration Camp.
I know this because the Ghetto was closed by the Gemans and all males went to
Buchenwald and all females to Ravensbruck. Buchenwald at that time was only for
males.
2.	. „ I identify, lip. 51, op phptpgraph 2/5/6 as a photograph of a man I knew
as LEVf and whom I now know is called JOMJd LEVf. One day,whilst I was in
PETSIKAU with ny mother and father, this man together ^7ith some German Security
Police came round the houses , In the Courtyard of a house No.11 in
Leonarda Street, I and my family were living in No.12, there was a deep hole
dug in the ground, the entrance of which was inside the tool shed in the
courtyard. This hole had been dug as a hiding place for two families who
lived in the house No® 11. I saw LEVj point to the tool shed and draw uie
attention of the German police to it. Half an hour later the Gestapo arrived
and went into the tool shed and about 30 people who were in hiding there came
out. These people were marched away and I never saw them again. I have been
told they were shot.
j saV7 LEVt beat people on three occasions with a stick 'which was the
usual stick employed by the Jewish police, one of which I examined on one

Royal Army Medical Corps, Officer in charge of the Surgical Division,
29 British General Hospital, M.B., CU&B. , F.R.C.S. , sworn before '
Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Gem, Royal Artillery, Commanding,
No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	At the request of No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team I have
examined and conducted X Rays of MARIA EABAJOWA of LUKOW, near LUBLIN',
POLAND, and STANISLAWA MICHALIK, of GOVOLIN, near WARSAW, POLAND, both of
whom are female patients in 29 British General Hospital in BELSEN Camp.
2.	The X Ray Plates so taken are attached marked CABAJ M 3/6/45
and MICHALIK S 3/6/45 respect!veljr.	There are two plates relating to
the former which are further marked 35 CCS 1173 and two Plates relating
to the latter which are further marked 35 CCS 1174. Also attached and
marked Exhibit 'A* and Exhibit / 'B' respectively are my signed Reports
relating to the<M Ray Examinations referred to.
3.	I Have been shown and have read Depositions of the two patients
referred to and sworn before an officer of No 1 War Crimes Investigation
Team dated 25th and 23rd of June 1945 respectively and marked Exhibit
166 and Exhibit 167 respectively. There is nothing in either Deposition
which is in any way incompatible with the results of my medical examination
and X Ray of the two women referred to. The Statement of MICHALIK, however,
to the effect that bone was, removed from .her leg needs qualification in
that in my opinion, it is unlikely that any’appreciable portion of bone
was taken out and more likely that a small portion was removed for
cultural bacteriological purposes.
4.	In particular,,the following comments are applicable in the case
of MICHALIK. There has certainly been some, surgical treatment to one
of the bones, a likely possibility being that something was injected into
it. There are slight structural changes in the left tibia. As above
stated, it is unlikely that bone was actually taken out and more likely
purposes. There light have been four separate operations but it is imposs-
ible to state positively at this stage. Such operations as there were
certainly took place more than a yea}? ago and may easily have been three
years ago. No permanent harm was caused bv such operations but scars

Camp life. In the case of EABAJOWA my opinion is that there has been
a graft from the left tibia into the right. This may have been -because
of a simple fracture either accidental or deliberate.,, or 2-g- inches of bone
may have been completely removed from the right tibia and replaced by
graft. It is impossible to say whether there was more than one operation
but such operations as there were took place at least two years ago or
some time previously. The results are not serious and though there is no
sign of injections having been made it is possible that there may be
infection as a result of an injection or injections became of adherent
for. the perfomance of the operations in question but consider it a
feasible possibility that they were performed in the course of experiments
-1-﻿relating to the possibility of bone grafting in the presence of infection,
which is normally prohibited by proper standardised medical procedure.
6.	I should add that both the women in question impressed me as being
of a good peasant type and as being completely credible and reliable
on the subject of their case history.

X - RAJ.
Firmly united double fracture of Rt Tibial upper and mid shaft
with slight »'**»'* deformity. Left tibia shows bone loss of mid shaft

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
ATROCITIES AT AUSCHWITZ AND BELSEN
^DEPOSITION of RUTH OTTTMAM, late of SRBOBRAU, BACKA, YUGOSLAVIA,
sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Genn, Royal Artillery, Cotnraanding,
No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1 ♦	I am 32 years of age, was bom in VIENNA, and married a
Yugoslav in November 1939. I am a Doctor of Medicine and was arrested by
tiie Hungarians in April 194A oecause I am a Jewess. I was taken to various
internee camps in HUNGARY and arrived at AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp
on 29th June 1944.
2*	The journey to AUSCHWITZ from BACSALMAS, HUNGARY, took four
nights and five days. We travelled in goods wagons, an average of about
80 to a wagon, men women and children together. Nothing was provided
in the wagons except tin pails for sanitary and ablutionary purposes,
together with two jugs of v/ater in each. V/e were allowed out of the wagon
in which I travelled twice for short stops in 'the course of the journey.
The wagons were closed in and we vrere under 3S Guard.
3*	On arrival at AUSCHWITZ Station segregation into two main groups
was done by SS Officers. The principle of segregation was difficult to
understand but it arypeared that all old people, children and young people
with young children were put into one large group and the remainder into
the second. I was one of the remainder. I do not know what happened
to the former group but I am convinced they went to the Gas Chamber since
there were several friends and acquaintances of mine among them and I
never saw any of them again.
. 0n arrival at the Womens* Camp we were stripped of clothing, our
heads shaved, and we ’were made to bath, and then issued'with a vest and a '
dress each. No other clothing was allowed us and all our possessions
had been taken from us on the Station. We then went to our allotted
Huts. We were approximately 500 to a Hut and there was just room in
y/hich to lie down. On the following day 500 more arrived and we were
about 1000 to a Hut. After a day or two I became the Doctor to the Block
in Y/hich I was located.
5*	During my stay at AUSCHWITZ I saw a certain amount of brutality
towards prisoners but I vras in such an apathetic state through the
considerable amount of drugs of a bromide nature, given to all prisoners,
that I did not take much note of what was happening around me then.
*5*	I remember two instances of beatings in particular. First,
on one occasion I sa?f DOCTOR MENCELE, who was the Chief Doctor, seize and
beat with a stick an elderly woman who had been cutting Y/ood* I do not
know the reason for the beating nor do I know what effect it had on the
victim, but using a stick he struck the woman very hard some ten or a dozen
times, starting on the lower part of the back and finishing with one or two
particularly vicious bloY/s on the side of the neck, which might obviously
do considerable physical harm. The second instance I remember was when a
friend of mine DOCTOR REGINA KOENIG of SUBIDICA, JUGOSLAVIA, whose present
whereabouts I do not know, tried to escape from a Transport. She was
caught by SS Woman DREXLER and made to go back* but before doing so she
was struck several times hard and viciously in the face by DREXLER.	(
DREXLER habitually beat prisoners with her hands, alv^ays wearing gloves
and making them stand stiffly to attention while she struck them in the face.
She was, in my opinion, a particularly unpleasant sadistic type. Her
description is as follovra:-
Thin and bony figure, small (about 1.60 metres in.height)
with ash-blonde hair done in the "up-swept" style. A thin face.
-1-﻿vdth slightly protruding teeth, and prominent cheek hones.
Blue eyes, and a habit of walking very fast with her body
leaning forward. She was about 33 years old, a spinster,
had a quite exceptional memory for faces, names and dates,
and came from SCBLESIEN.
7*	Selections of prisoners for one purpose or another were a
V)!) frequent occurrence in AUSCHWITZ, taking place on an-average probably
three times a week. We were never told what such selections were for,
but it was generally believed that some were for the Gas Chamber.' All I
can say about them is that they -were usually conducted in the open by an
S3 AUPSEHERIN, though on one occasion I saw, at a distance, one made by
DOClGR MENGELE outside a Hut for which the women were paraded naked and
from which some were taken away in a Transport. I am myself convinced that
this selection was to find' women suffering from Scarlatina, of which there
was a mild epidemic in the Camp at the time. I do not know what happened
to the women who were taken away on the transport . Generally, in regard
to these selections, I can say that I have, since coming to BELSEN, seen
many acquaintances who Y/ere taken away on Transports from AUSCHWITZ after
such selections, which had been for working parties or for moves to other
places. On the other hand, I remember one or two transports which we
believed to be going to the Gas Chamber, and from among my acquaintances
on sucli Transnorts.I have never seen any at BELSEN or anywhere else.
V? I myself left -AUSCHWITZ hav«*been selected for a Transport in the middle
J of October 1%4 and was; taken to an Arbeitslager at GUBEN. I remained
there, continuing my work as Block Doctor, until the end of January 1945*
I then came to BELSEN, arriving in early February.
8.	Whilst at EELSEN I continued my work as a Doctor and
therefore did not see a.great deal of what Yrent on in the Camp.
Condi.tions were very bad on arrival and there were so many to a Hut
that there was only room to sit, with ones knees drawn up, on the floor.
9.	During the last three or four weeks before the English
liberated BELSEN^ori 15th April -\9b-5y there was; a great deal of sporadic
shooting at all times of the day and night. I remember on one occasion
about 13th April 1945 being called .for by BRONCA SALOMONOVITCH, vdio was
a Typhus patient in a Ward I was. in charge of in Block 210. On going
to her I found her bleeding badly from a bullet YYound in the am. She had
been lying with her arm above her head and the bullet had. entered the
wall facing her, taking a downward course, and piercing her arm. I do not
know who fired the bullet nor,did I look to see, being engaged in
attending to the wound. From the clear downward direction of the
bullet, however, I am convinced that it was fired by a Hungarian because
there had been a number of Hungarian guards doing duty at the only spot
from which the bullet could have been fired, throughout the day on which
the incident occurred. I also, during this period in BELbEN, saw
several patients brought in by Ambulance to the Hospital who also had
bullet vrounds in various parts of their bodies.
10.	During the last few days at BELSEN, Hungarian troops^appeared
to have taken over much of the guard duties around the Camp perimeter.^
Durim this time there vras so much shooting during the day and night that
I was"afraid to go out of the Block. I did not actually^see people
firing but I am convinced from'what I have been told. and. from the iact
that it grew so much worse after the Hungarians took over, that they
v/ere mainly responsible for the bulk of the shooting.
X was present on one occasion at an operation on a male
internee performed by SS DOCTOR HORSTMANN. The operation was very
badly performed. I do not mean by this that HORSTMANN v/asnot a
capable and qualified Doctor, but my impression Y/as that he was
completely careless as to whether his- work was successful or not, or whether
the patient benefited by the operation, or whether he lived or died.

3.	In July 1943, at Auschwitz, I was employed digging ditches and
graves for burying dead. The Capo in charge of my working party was LOTHE.
At this time I was working with a woman named RLJCHLA GRDNWMD and I sskad heard,
her ask LOTHE for permission to go to the lavatory. LOTHE/hefused to let her
go 4-wii."rirj and without making a further request GHUNFAID put down her shovel and
left her work. As soon as she moved from her work I saw IOTHE go up to GHUNftALD
and beat her about the head and body until she collapsed unconscious, with blood
V .reaming from her head. For the beating IDTHE used a wooden stick which was
about 2 feet long and about 1 inch in diameter. Assisted by some of the other
prisoners I carried GRONIALD to her block and we dressed her wounds as best we
could. The next day I saw GRONWALD being taken to Block 25. This Block was
reserved for persons who were destined for the Gas Chamber. I never saw GHJlwALD
oganr*. I am of opinion that GHONWALD met her death in the Gas Chamber because
due to the beating she had received by LOTHE she was unable to work, and all
persons unable to work or who were ill, were automatically sent to the Gas Chamber.
In this way LOTHE has been responsible for sending many people to the Gas Chamber.

occasion hit me on the nose with her fist, making my nose bleed. I had no

remained until 15th July 1943. I was then transferred to Auschwitz and in

November 1944 came to Belsen.
2,	On 22nd June 1945, with my friends EVA GRIKA and SONIA WATINIK,
I was in Camp 3, Belsen Camp, when I saw a woman whom I recognized as a Capo
at Auschwitz Camp. I did not know her name but have since been told that it

’i	In July 1943, whilst at Auschwitz, I was employed digging ditches
, y.!
outside the camp. While so enployed I laid down my shovel for a rest and LOTHE,
who was in charge of my working party, saw me. I saw her go to the woman S.S.
guard and I heard her ask the S.S. woman to set her dog on to me. I recognize
this S.S. woman as No. 2 on photograph Z/li/2. I did not know her name but have
now been told that it is IRMA GEESE. GEESE set her dog on to me and as a
result I was bitten, by the dog, on my right shoulder. I still have a scar on
ny shoulder where the dog bit me. I was made to continue working and I had
to dress; the wound nyself after I had returned to ny block. I returned to
work the following day because, if I had remained away from work I should have
been taicen to Block 25, and then to the Gas Chamber. During the time I was
at Auschwitz I was beaten at least once a week by LOTHE because I talked to
ny fellow prisoners.
in November 1943, whilst still at Auschwitz, I saw LOTHE beat
another woman named SCHENDLA WIDELETZ with a stick. LOTHE beat her oh the
head and body until the woman collapsed and then LOTHE kicked her. Although
still very ill UDELETZ worked on the following day. She worked because it
was general knowledge in the camp that if you were unable to work you were
sent to the gas chamber. I know that this same girl was sent to the gas
ctanber about six n>ontbs labor because she was sick aud could not work.﻿SWORN BY THE SAID DEPONENT

2,	During the summer of 1943> whilst at Auschwitz, I was employed digging

summer while I was digging, I saw my male cousin TEVEL SCHADROWSKI passing near
inhere I was working. He threw a piece of bread toward me but it fell a short
distance away. I went to pick it up, but before I could do so a woman Capo
picked it up and kept it for herself. She hit me twice with her fist, knocking

I saw LOTHE beat my friend EVA GRIKA. With her fists she hit EVA
in the face, making her nose bleed. I also saw LOTHE beat a woman prisoner
named RUSCELA GHONWALD because she left her work to go to the lavatory. For
this beating she used a wooden stick and carried on beating her until the woman
collapsed. I was also present and heard LOTHE ask an S.S. woman, whose name I
do not know but whom I recognize as No. 2 on photograph Tjb/2. and whose name I
have now been told is IRMA GRESE, to set her dog on to ny friend HANKA ROSENZWEIG.
I saw the dog bite HANKA in the shoulder.
5#	i have seen LOTHE beat many prisoners with a stick. Some of these
prisoners were beaten so badly that they were unable to work owing to the injuries
inflicted upon them by LOTHE. Because they were unable to work they were taken
to Block 25. It was common knowledge in the camp that people who were taken to
Block 25 were destined for the Gas Chamber. I have never seen any of these
people who were removed to Block 25 again.

1.	I amyls' years of age and, because I am a Jewess, I was arrested in
July 1942 and taken to Radom Labour Camp where I remained until 14th March 1943
when I was transferred to Pionki Factory. On 20th August 1944 I was sent to
Berkenau and, after three days there, went to Hindeburg Labour Camp. I came
to Belsen on 20th January, 3.945•
2.	During the three days in August 1944 when I was at Berkenau I was
in Block No. 22. The Block Leader of No. 22 was a woman whom I knew as ' Sala1.
On 21st June 1945 I have been shown by No. 14573509 Serjeant EDWARD DINSDALE,
86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, a woman whom I
recognized as the Block Leader of Block No. 22 at Berkenau. I have now been
told that her full name is SALA RAJCZEC.
On arrival at Berkenau our hair was cut and shortly after that it
was raining when we had to parade for Apell. I covered my head with a scarf
to go on Apell, not knowing that it was against the Camp regulations. RAJCZEC
saw me and beat me with a thick wooden stick which she always carried. She hit
me on the back of the head, the neck, shoulders and chest with the stick and
then proceeded to hit me about the face with her fists. As a result of this
beating ny body was so badly bruised that I could not stand on Apell the following
morning and had to be held uprigit by friends, ny mouth bled badly and I lost a
tooth. I fait very dizzy and was ill for about a week.
4,	One morning, during the three days at Berkenau, ny sister RITA
F3NKEIBTEIN, did not dress quickly enough and RAJCZEC beat her on the head
for about two minutes with one of ny sister's wooden shoes. I saw this
beating nyself and I have been told .by other prisoners that, in addition to
beating ny sister, that morning RflJCZBC also beat other prisoners who were late.
5#	On Apell, during these three days at Berkenau, I saw SAJCZEC
beating a girl, aged 12 years. Her name was BEINA GOLDBERG and I knew her from
ny home town of Firlej. RAJCZEC beat this girl with a thick wooden stick
until blood came from the girl* s nose and mouth. The girl fell down and after﻿^he beating was finished her two sisters picked her up and supported her.
When Apell was finished her sisters carried BEINA to; her block. I do not
know the reason for this beating.
6.	BAJCZEC was feared by all the internees at Berkenau, She
often told us that we would never leave the Camp but would all be sent to the
Gas Chamber.

1*	I am of German nationality and nry age is 25. I was arrested at Bremen
on 5th. August 1941 by the Gestapo, I was put in a cell in the local police
prison at Bremen where I remained for about a month. The reason for iny
arrest was that I had refused to work at the Pocke Wolfe factory. I was
then transferred to Ravensbruck where I remained until 26th. March 1942.
Prom there I was taken to AUSCHWITZ and I	in Auschwitz until
January 1945 when I was transferred to Ravensbruck for a short time and was
finally brou#it to Belsen in March 1945. On 17th. June 1945 I was arrested
by the British and confined in the local prison.
2.	In the year 1943 I was employed as a Capo at AUSCHWITZ and I recognise
No.l on Photograph Q/k/l as an SS Oberscharfuhrer whom I knew as SPEZI. I

When
that that is his real name. / I first met SCHEEXER lie was in charge of the

shootings took place. On this occasion I saw that when SCHREIER and the
other SS men returned from the room one of than was still wearing a glove
which was covered in blood. I was told by another Capo whose name is
JACOB that the men selected by SCHREIER and other SS men were taken up and
shot ^	^	-
3.	In the first week of February 1943 I was questioned by an SS man named
HOYER about an escape X had made from AUSCHWITZ in October 1942. I was
recaptured in December 1942. HOYER attempted to> find out who had sheltered me
during that period and I refused to tell him. I was bent over a table and
given a large number of strokes across ray back with a heavy wooden club.
SffiffiEIER and scane other SS men carried out the beating. I was them placed
in the bunker and remained there until the end of March 1943. I was very
ill and I still have scars on my back. It w as necessary for me to have an
-1-﻿operation.jpn June 1943 as a tig wound on ray back had not healed properly.
4*	SCHKEIER was generally very bad to the internees and I have often seen
ve frequent beatings.
5.	HOYER was an SS Unterscharfuhrer at AUSCHWITZ and I would describe
him as age about 30, height 5 ft 7 inches weight A30 lbs approximately, hair
dark brown, thick, face oval shaped, compexion brown, brown eyes, straight
pointed nose, high pitched voice, and good teeth.
6.	JACOB# was a Kapo at AUSCHWITZ. I would describe him as aged about 35

DEPOSITION of POLA PINKUSEWICZ (Female) late of Petrikau,
Schuhmacher Str 4, sworn before Captain ALEXANDER MACKENLAY FORBES, Royal
Artillerji-j Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am 25 years of age and am a Polish Jewess. I lived in
PETRIKAU at the above mentioned address with ny husband Jankiel Punkusewicz.
PETRIKAU was turned into a Ghetto by the Germans in 1943. At this,, time
I was pregnant but I did not want my child born in the Jewish Hospital
in the Ghetto;	I did not want to go there because I was afraid of
what might happen. I therefore secured papers which indicated that I
was a Polish Aryan. 1 escaped from the Ghetto and with these papers
was admitted into a Polish Hospital outside the Ghetto. A few days
\
after I had left I was told that my Husband had been taken away by the
Germans and I have never seen him again. My child, a boy, was born 00
I7th October 1943. I was very ill and I was retained in Hospital for
about seven weeks. I was unable to stay out of the Ghetto because I
had no friends and I had no optical but to go back into the Ghetto. I
got through the wires one night. Jews were no longer libing in iry
district where I had lived and I had to join my people who had been
rounded up into Blocks which were controlled by the Germans. I was
rounded up as a person who had been living illegally. I was taken to
the Synagogue by the Jewish Police, who were controlling the Ghetto uxsder„
the orders of the Germans. ^ J&ere were about 500 people there The
Jewish President WARSAVSKI, whom I knew well, and who was in charge
of the whole place, told me I could go,	ixkef-te:tkex&piagagaacxbKtxiaHdx
HEckxgEauiexKKRyxfexx but as I was making a movement to go a Jewish police-
man called LEVI stopped me and said "Where is your child, you are not
allowed to have young children in the Block?". I had the child hidden
in a sack which I was carrying on my back. Levi noticed this and he took
the child. He said to the President WARSAVSKI and the SS who were there
"Wait a moment" and took the child into the interior of the Synagogue
n-nrl came back a few minutes later without it. I tried to get bade
-1-﻿into the Synagogues hut the SS prevented me and. threatened to shoot me.
LEVI then came up behind me and took me to the Block and he said that
only people who could work were allowed in the Block. I have never
seen iny child since. I didmnot hear the S3 or anyone give orders to
LEVT to take my child away.

AND

DEPOSITION of MADELEUfE BARKANYI late of BUDAPEST, HONGART, sworn
before Lieutenant-Colonel Leopold John Genn, Royal Artillery, Commanding,
No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1*	I am 24- years of age and was born in BEREGSZASZ, RUTHENIA, of
Jewish ^rents. I was married to a Hungarian Jewish Doctor of Medicine in
BUDAPEST in December Jl9kGf
2*	On the 1st May 194-3 I accompanied my husband who was compelled
to take up work in a Hospital at ZALAEGERSZEG, Hungary, remaining there for
thirteen months. At the end of June 1944, my Husband and I were taken by
the Hungarians to the Ghetto in the same town and were kept there for some
days. During this period, when awaiting questioning by Hungarian Secret
Service officials I heard the cries of fellow captives being
beaten and tortured by the Hungarian Guards in order to make them disclose
where they were alleged to have hidden money and valuables. Several of
my acquaintances among such victims told me how they had been so beaten
and tortured and I saw the man4s on them in several cases as well as seeing
several people come out of the Hut in which the questioning took place
unable to walk properly and barely able to stand. I saw marks on various
people on different parts of their bodies including marks of beating on
the soles of the feet and the backs of the hands.
3.	On the 6th July 1944 we were taken in cattle trucks on a 24 hour
train journey to SARVAR, Hungary, where there were internment buildings in a
Factory for criminals and political prisoners. We travelled without
sanitation, food or water, 70 - 75 people per truck. All through this
period we were ordered by Hungarians working under German direction.
We spent four days at SARVAR and during this period I witnessed one incident
when a Hungarian Jew had his hands tied together behind him and was then
suspended by his hands for at least half an hour by a German S3 Man whose
name I do not know but who was a SCHWAB and whom I would describe﻿as Age about 22, height 6 ft, slim, mth a good figure, pale handsome
^Lean-shaven face, rather long and thin brown hair very flat, grey eyes
He was a Private soldier in S3 uniform, spoke Hungarian and always carried
an automatic pistol and a revolver and a "Kantchuka" which is a'
4.	We were taken from SARVAR to AUSCHWITZ, a four day journey by train.
No food was provided but we were given buckets and jugs in the bare trucks
in which we travelled. We were allowed out for short periods twice in
the course of the journey. On one of these occasions I saw a boy aged
about 17 start to run towards a lake about 250 yards away in the open <./.
without cover, my belief being that he wanted to get water. After he had
proceeded about 50 yards two shots were fired. I did not see him
fall but my husband did. Both of us saw him brought back on a blanket
and put in the train. Neither of us had any doubt that he was dead from the
way he was carried and the way the body lay. On arrival at AUSCHWITZ men
and women were sparated and my Husband went to one Camp and I to another.
5.	During the fourteen weeks that I was at AUSCHWITZ I saw much
cruelty and ill treatment of prisoners.
6.	In particular I remember at AUSCHWITZ SS Man WILLI URBAN07SKI who
was very frequently drunk and who on one occasion I saw use a thick cane
to strike and knock down a female prisoner who fell across some rails
^	which ran through the Camp. He then struck her indiscriminately with the
stick on all parts of her body for about five minutes. I do not know the
precise results of the beating but it was a very severe one. I would
%
describe TTRBANOVSKI as aged about 30, height 5 ft 9 inches, face sharp
n, with a slightly hooked nose, clean shaven, with a
small mouth and small iron-blue eyes. Hair light brown, figure slim.
He had a lazy walk, used long strides, was bow-legged
and had noticably bony hands.
7.	I never knew of any organised punishments at AUSCHWITZ but one
girl I know BLIMA FELDBRANDT told me that she was once taken to the
Gestapo Room at AUSCHWITZ where the political police questioned her and
beat her badly to make her reveal the names of Communist friends of hers.
8.	In late October I was moved to an Arbeitslager at BIRNBAUMEL,
near BRESLAU. This was a small Camp, in charge of OBERSCHARFUHRER OTTO
-2-﻿SCJ
%

%
\
x *
^ ,

SCHWMKE, containing 1000 prisoners. It was one of five Camps commanded
HA.DPTSTURMPUHRER BSRNAU, all of which depended from the big camp at
GROSS ROSEN. In this Camp I acted as Secretary and Assistant to
SCHIANKE and was described as RAEP0RTSCHREIBER3N. Treatment by the
guards in this Camp was not as bad as at AUSCHWITZ, but on one occasion
I saw SS Woman STEFANIA SCMIDT, who came from BRESLAU and who was the girl
friend of SCHWANKE bring a woman aged about 40, who had been stealing some bread
into the office and beat her with a stick all over her boafer until I could
not bear it any longer and ran out of the office. When I returned after
a moment or two she was still beating and although SCHWANKE told her to
stop it she went on for a little before she did. I cannot say what was
the result of the beating, but it was a very severe one.
■w	li/V 84'-‘K\£ !~
9.	There was also^/an SS Woman GERTRUD WOSNEK who came from the SOUTH
SUDETMLAND, who was always urging the Commandant to send sick girls
to AUSCHWITZ for extermination. I several times watched her beat with a
stick prisoners who were lined tip waiting for food. She appeared to
beat without reason and would then come back to the office and gloat
to us about what she had done. She was, to my mind, obviously sadistic.
10.	I was sent to BELSEN in the early part of February and was employed
as a Nurse in the Hospital Block. I remember one occasion I believe to
have been on 14th April 1945, which was the day before the British came,
I was in the corridor of the Hospital Block in which I worked when I heard
a shot aid a cry from the nurses room. I came into the room to find one
'C-X&C
of the nurses IBRCNCA SAL(MaTGVTTCH with s/wound in her arm. Doctor GuHMANN
V
came in at the same time and started to attend to the wound and I went outside
at once to try to see where the bullet had came from. There was a hole
in the wall just beside the window frame from which it was obvious the
bullet had taken a downward course. On going outside and looking in the
direction from which the hole in the wall indicated the bullet had come.
$
I have no doubt that it had been fired from one of the watch towers in
kk which I knew Hungarian Guards to have been because we saw the Guards
being changed] periodically and therefore we assumed that it was only
Hungarians in the watch towers on this day. There was nobody about outside
£
the Huts to indicate at whom the bullet might have been fired or why. I
believe the wounded girl is still in Hospital at BELSEN having treatment

Further to my Deposition of 3rd July 1945«
I remember a Block Leader at AUSCHWITZ whose name was
1.
2.
EDITH ENGEL. I was for a time in her Block. She was very cruel and
often beat people quite unnecessarily and superfluously. I remember
on one occasion in particular there was more noise going on in the Hut
in which I was than she liked. She came in and struck anybocly within
reach at the same time telling us to be quiet.	The Hut was so crowded
that there was only room to sit and she could only reach the people in
the front rows.	Finally, using either a wooden clog or a stick, I
now forget which, she struck a middle aged Polish woman several times
on the head and one final vidous blow which opened up a deep out from
the temple about five or six inches backwards across the head. It would
have been a bad blow in any case but the woman's head was shaved and it
therefore had even more effect. I cannot now remember the name of the
victim but she was very thin, pale and weak, and when the cut began to stream
another internee from Transylvaftlff,^wKo"was a wcnfenDoctor^improvised
dressings and bound up the wound. The victim finally recovered so
far as I know but I saw hej^several days afterwards and there was no
doubt that the blow had considerably weakened her and made her iller
than she had been. I am a trained Nurse and am of the opinion that
though the blow in question could hardly have caused death it was
-1-﻿sufficiently serious to be worthy of notice and remembrance even though

beatings of all k±n<3s were an everyday occurrance.

Poland, sworn before
, fN* I. Vh0laa	^o-tCk..
1. I am a Polish Jew aged 35 years and was arrested in September 1941. I
■was first taken to a Camp at Buchwerder Porst and soon after to Grunow. On
18th August 1943 I was transferred to Auschwitz but on the same day was moved
again to Buna. In August 1944 I was transferred to Laurahutte Camp and in
January 1945 to Mauthausen, In February 1945 I went to Hanover arriving at
Belsen on 6th, April 1945.
K
’	2, I first met SCHLOMOIVICZ at Buna but I did not know him very well,
I met him again at Laurahutte where we lived in the same room, I was in the
same block with him at Mauthausen but at Hanover we did not live in the
same block but I saw him frequently because the camp was a small one.
$
In all these camps SCHLOMOIVICZ was a Capo, At Belsen he was a blockalteste
of Block No, 12 in which I lived,
3, - In Laurahtftte ard. Hanover I was employed as a barber for the SS but in
all the other camps I was on general duties,
I	'
*	4, I have never seen SCHLOMOIVICZ beat anyone although I have been told
that he has beaten people on about five occasions but not very hard and with
his hands. One of those who was beaten told me that he had been hit in the
face by SCHLOMOIVICZ using his fist and he had received two blows. I later
asked SCHLOMOIVICZ the reason and he told me that the man -who was a Doctor
had worked as a Doctor in one of the Hospitals in the Hanover Camp and had
stolen food from the patients while they were very sick so that when this
i
man joined the working party SCHLOMOIVICZ took the opportunity of punishing
him.
5, I have no doubt that on some occasions it was necessary to use force
on some of the internees but it is my opinion that he only punished those
who stole something and especially those who stole other prisoners’ rations. I
I have never heard of him beating anyone with a stick or a rubber cable and
I have often seen him give away some of his own food.	In fact he has	i
givten food almost every day to children^ As a Capo he got a double ration.	|

1.	I am 21 years of ageand am a Polish Jew. I was arrested by the S.S.
in September 1941 and taken to Rzeszow Labour Camp where I remained for about
2g- years. I was then transferred to Plaschau Concentration Camp and after
passing through various Concentration Camps arrived in Belsen on 8th April 1945,
2.	Accompanied by No, S/2591667 Staff-serjeant E.S. CONNING, Royal Any
Service Corps, Judge Advocate General’s Branch, attached to No, 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team, I visited Belsen Detention Cells on the ^ day of JULY
1945 where I identified a man whom I recognized as the factory foreman and camp
Capo at Rzeszow Labour Camp. I knew Mm by the name of MANEK GRUNSPAN and
have now been told that his full name is MENDEL GRUNSPAN.	>■'*-&*****'
3.	One day during the summer of 1942, after having finished iny work in
the factory at Rzeszow Labour Camp, I was lining up for ny evening meal. I
was very tired and was not standing upright, GRUNSPAN came along the line
and because I was not standing upright he hit me over the head with a long
rubber truncheon.	My head was cut open and blood flowed from the wound and
ran down my neck.	For about two months afterwards I suffered from headaches.
4.	There were three brothers at this camp who regularly received parcels
of food from their relatives. I oannot r&membin the Tames of 'these «m.
GRUNSPAN would always take half the contents of these parcels for himself.
During the summer of 1942 I remember an occasion when they received a parcel
and they refused to let GHUNSPAN have half of the contents when he demanded
it. GRUNSPAN told the Gas.t.aftb^who took these three men away, and^shot them.
Fifty of the internees, including nyself, were ordered to the spot where they
had been shot and were ordered to dig a grave and buoy them. I noticed that
the men had been shot through the head and that they were naked. Between us
we dug the grave and burie^ these men.
5.	At the factory we worked in 12 hour shifts. During December 1942
I remember an occasion when I had not long come off the day shift and was
asleep in bed. About 11 o' clock that same evening GRUNSPAN awoke the whole
block and ordered everyone outside on parade. After standing in the cold
1-﻿^pr about half an hour he dismissed the parade and ordered us back to bed.
After a further half an hour he again ordered us out on parade -where we had
to remain standing for another half an hour. He then dismissed us again
and we went back to bed. This continued throughout the night at half-hourly-
intervals and although we had lost so much sleep we were forced to go to work
as usual the following morning. As far as I am aware GHUNSPM had no reason
at all for ordering these parades.
6.	I remember that in the summer of 1943 > during the evening, I had come
off the day shift with the other workers. We had all had a very tiring day's
work and we left the factory walking very slowly and bent with exhaustion.
When leaving the factory we were expected to walk quickly and in an upright
manner. Because we moved slowly GKUNSPM made the whole of the day shift,
who had just completed a hard day's work, jump up and down on their toes for
three hours. Although very tired and weak, the next morning we were forced
to do our day’s work.

taken to Okenoze Labour Camp where I remained until 11th May 1943 when I was

went to Budzymia Concentration Camp. At the end of May 1944 I was transferred

X was one of the internees who paraded. The parade was for the purpose
of our witnessing the punishment to be inflicted on this man. GHDNSPAN
forced the man to strip naked and then lie face clown on a table. GRONSPAN
then beat this man across the buttocks with a long rubber truncheon, giving
him 25 strokes. After this beating the man’s buttocks were covered with red

then went to various Camps and finally came to Belsen in March 1945.
2.	During May 1944, while I was at Rzeszow ‘Labour Camp, a Polish Jew
by the name of MANEK GHDNSPAN was Foreman of the factory there. On 26th

SZULIM KLODA, I was going to the Control Tower at Rzeszow Labour Camp to
' clock on' for work. Just before reaching the Control Tower an internee
by the name of ISRAEL DAVIDSON approached me and asked me to clock him in
to avoid walking to the Tower as he was suffering from a bad leg. I took
his card and said that I would. When I arrived at the Control Tower I
found nmrar GHUNSPAN there. I asked him for permission to clock on DAVIDSON
and he refused. .He immediately began to punch me in the face with his fists
and ordered another internee to assist him. They both continued to punch
me until I fell to the ground unconscious. Before losing consciousness they
kicked me on the head, legs and chest whilst I was lying on the ground.
When I recovered about an hour later I was made to do a full day* s work.

1.	I aml!f2 years of age and am a Polish Jew. I was arrested by the
Cestapo in November 1942 and taken to Budzin Labour Camp which changed to a
Concentration Camp in September 1943. On 15th May 1944 I was sent to Rzeszow
Labour Camp where I remained for 10 weeks, and after passing through various
other Camps I came to Belsen on 8th April 1945.
2.	Accompanied by No. 3/259166? Staff-serjeant ERNEST STANLEY CONNINC,
^ Royal Army Service Corps, Judge Advocate General’s Department, attached to

going to the factory to * clock on* at the control tower. On the way we met
TSBATST, DAVIDSON who had a bad leg and could not walk very well. He asked
EDELSTEIN if he would clock him on to save him the walk to the control tower
arh. ray friend took DAVIDSON'S card and agreed to do so. At the control tower
we met GRDNSPAN and ny friend asked for permission to clock on DAVIDSON.
GRUNSPAN refused permission and commenced to punch EDELSTEIN in the face with
his fists calling on someone else to assist him. Together they punched my
friend until he fell to the ground and then they commenced to kick him all
over the body. At this time I had to leave to commence work and as I left
I saw that my friend's face was covered with blood. I did not see EDSLSTEIN
until dinner time when he complained of pain and showed me bruises from the
beating he had receivel. Although I was only a short time in this camp I saw
GEUNSPAN ill-treat prisoners, and he was far more brutal than the S.S..

before Captain ALEXANDER MACKINLAY FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investi ga tion/Teem.
1.	I am 16 years of age and am a Polish Jew. On 21st July 1942 I was
arrested by the Gestapo and taken to a forced labour camp at Rzeszow where I
remained for two years. When I left Rzeszow I passed through various
Concentration Camps and finally came to Belsen on 7th April 1945.
2.	Accompanied by S/2591667 Staff-serjeant ERNEST STANLEY CONNING-,
Royal Amy Service Corps, Judge Advocate General's Department, attached to
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team, I visited Belsen Detention Cells on
the	day of JULY 1945 where I identified a man whom I recognized as the
factory foreman and camp Capo at Rzeszow Labour Camp. I knew him by the
name of MANEK GRUNSPAN and have now been told that his full name is MENDEL
GHDNSPAN.
J.	The labour Camp at Rzeszow contained an aircraft factory in which I
worked. Two months after I arrived in this Camp GRUNSPAN arrived at the camp
as an ordinary internee. He was later made Block Alteste. The work in tne
factory was very hard and tiring and the Commandant, Oberscnarfuhrer ns TER,
12
gave strict orders that the internees should do only hours work daily.
When, however, the Commandant was away GRUNSPAN made the internees work 15
hours and more daily. I have heard him speaking to the Factory Cniei FALK,
and he said ' Twelve hours is not enough. Thqy can do more'.	When
internees were sick and unable to work GHDNSPAN used to take them down into a
cellar and beat them across the buttocks with a rubber truncheon. I have
not seen these beatings but I have seen the internees after the beatings and
they have told me about how GHDNSPAN, sometimes helped by other Block Leaders,
had beaten than. I have seen the marks of such beatings on their buttocks
v
and I have seen that they were obviously in great pain.
4.	I cannot remember the date, but one night we were working in the factory,
and when we went into the dining room for a meal we were given very bad soup
and were unable to eat it. An internee named GUNSBERG wanted to go to has
Block to fetch some bread but GRUNSPAN would not allow him to leave. Afte

argument G-RDNSPM beat him across the head -with a rubber truncheon and with his
^^sts. GUNSBEEG's head was covered with blood and he fell to the ground.
GHUNSPAN then called the S.S. men and one of them pulled out his revolver and
ordered the fallen man to get up or he would shoot. OTIJSBEHG- managed to get
up and although very weak and ill after the beating which he had received was

the Autumn of 1942 and taken to the Ghetto in Petrikau, from where I was

2.	I knew JONAS LEVY before the war in my home town of
Petrikau, and I identify him as No. 31 on photograph z/5/6.
3.	In the Ghetto he was employed as a policeman. Before the
Germans commenced the system of wholesale shooting of Jews he was a well
respected, decent, quiet man, but when it was^necessa^r for Levy to carry
out to a great extent the orders of the Germans, opinions began to differ:
Those whan he saved from shooting were full of praise for him, whilst the
relatives of those he was unable to save had not a good word f$r him.
4.	After the shootings, in the winter of 1942, a woman told me
that LEVY had saved her life. She was a married woman of about 24 years

DEPOSITION OP Estera RUBIN (Female) late of 5 Tribunalki Plata, FETRIKAU,
Poland, sworn before Captain Alexander Mackinley FORBES, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
X am 45 years of age and am a Polish Jew. I cannot remeiaber
when I was taken to the Ghetto at PETRIKAU nor the dates of my transfer to
other camps, but from the Ghetto I was taken to BLASHtJTTE Camp in PETRIKAU,
was later transferred to RAVENSBRUCK, and from thence to BELSEN.
2.	I recognize No. 31 on Photograph 2/5/6 as a man from my home
town of PETRIKAU, whom I knew by the name of LEVI, and whose name I have
now been told is JONAS LEVY. He was employed as a policeman in the Ghetto
at PETRIKAU.
He a good reputation amongst the members of the Ghetto and
I have never heard of an instance where he has done anything against them.
4.	I was a shopkeeper in the Ghetto, and it was against German
rules to have the shop open after eight o'clock at night. On several
occasions I was open after this time and was showing a light in the shop,
but LEVY never reported me for it.
5#	One day - I do not remember the month or year - the Germans
ordered that a certain number of women be assembled, and it was rumoured that
these wcmen would be later shot. The policemen, including LEVY, were
ordered to collect together this nuuber. At the time the collection was
going on I was in the street.	I saw LEVY, and he deliberately avoided me ;
JO on- to avoid having to put me amongst those selected.

THE DEFENCE OF SALA RAJCZEC.
DORA ROTH (Female) late otf Brod/Nad-Irsavou 154, Czechoslovakia, s-wom before
Captain ALEXANDER MACKTHLAY FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 20 years of age. In April 1943 I was taken to the Ghetto in Brod
and remained there until June 1943 when I was transferred to Auschwitz. In
January 1945 I was transferred to Belsen.
2.	I remember seeing SALA RAJCZBC at Auschwitz. She was not living in my
block there, but when I was transferred to Belsen in January 1945 I was put
into Block 218 where RAJCZEC was Blockalteste. I have never seen her beat
anyone in a brutal fashion. I have seen her slap stragglers and slow people
on parade or those ordered to bring food. She was always helpful to us and
looked after our food and accommodation. She always went herself to get the
food from the kitchen, notwithstanding bad or cold weather. Other Block-
alteste sent their deputies or some other person if the weather was bad.
RAJCZEC especially careifor the sick. When there was a roll-call she often
allowed sick people to remain in the block although, by doing this, she
risked severe punishment from the 3.S. She was often reprimanded by S.S.
woman GRESE for being lenient toward the sick, and was, I remember, punished
by being ordered to do drill and gymnastics for two or more hours in the open
during very bad and cold weather. As far as possible she tried to put all
the sick in a special room where she had a fire lighted despite the fact that
it was against the regulations to have a fire. This led her into trouble
with the S.S. men and women too. On parades she would often tell the sick
and elderly people to hide themselves in the last ranks behind the backs of
the people in front and to sit down, provided that they got up when the S.S.
personnel approached.

I am 25 years of age and was arrested bgwddw^CeuClurW'i and ^
Gestapo in Chechanow on the 15th December, 1942, in a round-up of Jewish people.
I was taken to the Ghetto of Milan, where we were sorted out by age, and after
staying one day I was brought to Auschwitz Concentration Camp on the 17th
December, 1942, and was placed in Camp Birkenaa. I remained there until
the 26th January, 1945, when I left for Bergen, Belsen.
2>	On the 13th June, 1945, I was arrested in Belsen Camp by the
British Military Police on a charge of suspected brutality against internees,
was taken to Belsen Detention Cells.

S.S. Btotersoharfuhrer or Oberscharfuhrer from AuschwiVs’.*	1* 91&* kbt' know his
name but I have since been told that it is HEINRICH SCHREIER. SCHREIER
was in charge of the Bunker, which is the Camp Prison at Auschwitz, and I saw
him there in October,.1944, when I came from Birkenan to see ajriendjf mine
who was in the Bunker at the time. Her name was ROSA ROB^TA, bu^ she
was later hanged by the Germans for trying to smuggle ammunition into partisan

hands.

"Eapportfuhrer Tauber" (who wee. a praeinehf flguie IS.' thb' Ahbbbbit* Camp).
At this SCHREIER was obviously perturbed and went rather pale - I think
because he thought that A* I .raid denounce him. When 1 told him that I

THE DEFENCE OF A CAPO NAMED JOHANNA BOTH.
DEPOSITION OF DORA- RATTNER (Female) late of Lemberg, Szeptycki, kh- Riand, sworn
before Captain RONALD PERCY BENTHAM-GREEN, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
I am. 1? years of age and am a Polish Jewess. I was arrested
1
in June 1944 at Lemberg, because I was a Jewess, and I was taken to Plaschau
Concentration Camp hear Cracow. From there I went to Auschwitz where I remained
until December 1944. I was then transferred to a Concentration Camp at Bude
near Auschwitz where I remained for two months. I came to Belsen on 15th
February 1945 •
2.	I recognize No. 30 on photograph Z/b/k as a woman whom I knew
under the name of 'HANNI* but whose name I now know to be JOHANNA ROTH.
I first met JOHANNA ROTH at Bude Concentration Camp where she
was employed as an assistant to a Capo. There she had to deal with a Russian
working party. I did not see nor did I hear of her beating anyone there.
At Belsen JOHANNA ROTH was the Stubendienst of Block 199 • I
eparate room in the block with the Block Leader a girl called j?RIEDA
lived in a s
FRANKL.	I have many times seen ROTH beating the internees who would not get out
of bed to attend Apell. I know that many of these internees were too sick to get
out of bed but the only test which ROTH could apply was to beat them to see
whether they were capable of getting out of bed or not. Many of the internees
tried to avoid roll-call by feigning sickness. I have also seen her hitting
people who were queuing for their food but again it was necessary to keep order.
It might be said that ROTH did beat unnecessarily but I will say this that she was
an excellent Stubendienst and I do not know of any case where the victim died.
The extreme hunger of the internees was the cause of the bad discipline at the
food queues and again the conditions of the camp and the bad state of health of
the internees accounted for their reluctance to get up at roll-call.

A CAPO NAMED JOHANNA ROTH
DEPOSITION of SOFIA ROSENZWEIG (Female) late of 22 Joseph
Pilsudski Street, Slomniki, Poland, sworn before Captain Ronald Percy
BENTHAM-CREEN, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation
Team.
1#	I am 23 years of age and a Polish Jewess. In
September, 1942, I voluntarily left Slomniki and went to the Ghetto of
Cracow. In March, 1943, I was arrested in Cracow and taken to FLASCHAD
Concentration Camp, near Cracow. I stayed there for about 18 months and
was then transferred to AUSCHWITZ. I was transferred from AUSCHWITZ to
BELSEN in December 1944*
2.	I recognise No 30 on Photograph NoZ/5/4 as a woman
whom I knew as "HANNI", but whose name I now know to be JOHANNA ROTH. I
was also taken to BELSEN Detention Cells by 13118612 Corporal H. Aitchison,
Pioneer Corps, 21 Array Group Interpreters' Pool, on the 10th July 1945,
where I identified the said JOHANNA ROTH as being the person I knew as
"HANNI".
3.	I first met JOHANNA ROTH in BELSEN. She was assistant
Block Leader in Block No 199, the Block in ’which I lived.
There were about 800 women in Block 199 and it was the
duty of ROTH to get the women out of bed to attend Apell. On one occasion
I was sick with Typhus and I felt too ill to get up for Apell. When ROTH
came round to me to get me out of bed I told her I felt very ill but ROTH
insisted that I got up and commenced to beat me with a wooden lath taken from
a bed. I had marks on ny shoulders for two weeks after the beating. I
admit that many of the internees used to feign sickness in order to avoid
getting up for roll call but in my case it should have been obvious to ROTH
that I was very ill. It is ny opinion, too, that ROTH tried to please
the S3 too much to the detriment of the internees.
5#	I saw ROTH on one occasion beating an old woman who
was lying in bed about three yards from me. It was obvious that the woman﻿•was sick and was not atleto get up but ROTH continued beating her. I do not
know how long the beating lasted because I left the room to attend Apell.
When I returned to the Block later in the day the old woman had disappeared.
4
It is possible that she was taken to Hospital but I have not seen her since.
I estimate the woman's age as between 40 and 45 but she looked about 60.
Premature aging was caused through the concentration camp conditions.
A woman of 40 was considered to be an old woman in a concentration camp.

DEPOSITION of Sofia LITVINSKA, late of 1 Maistrasse, Lublin,
Poland, sworn before Captain Ronald Percy HENTHAM-GREM, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am a Polish Jewess aged 28. I was arrested in LUBLIN
in May, 1940, because I was Jewish and my husband was an officer in the
Polish Army. I was a year in prison in LUBLIN and was then sent to
AUSCHWITZ, where I remained until November, 1944. From AUSCHWITZ I went
to various camps, finally arriving at HELSEN in March, 1945.
2.	I know Use LOTH from AUSCHWITZ. She was there all the
time I was there myself - that was between May, 1941', and November, 1944*
When I first met her she was an ordinary prisoner in the Strafkoannando, but
later she was made a Capo for outside working parties.
I saw her again in a kitchen in HELSEN. This time she was
a Capo in an agricultural working party. I never saw her beat anybody and
she never interfered with the girls who were doing their duty.
2f>#	I am sure that there are many others who would speak
favourably of her, but many of the girls who would testify have left

DEPOSITION OP 7.TT.A ZIMERtvLAN (Male) late of 8, Eynekmale, Tarnobrzeg, Poland,

No. 1 War Grimes'Investigation Team.
1.	I am 23 years of age and am a Polish Jew. I was arrested
-.	■ -y, >	vv/'...	~
in May 19W) and put in prison at Dembitza, and after spending 14 days there I
was transferred to Rzeszow Labour Camp. After passing through various Gamps
I was finally transferred to Belsen in the middle of March 1945.
2.	I first met MENDEL GRUNSPAN in the Labour Camp at Rzeszow.
I knew him then by the name of MANEK GRUNSPAN and he was employed there as
foreman in the factory, and in the camp itself as camp policeman. I was
«
employed in the factory as a painter and had access to every part. I often
heard shouting and screaming from the bunker in the factory so I have, on
occasions, purposely taken ny paint pot and pretended to work so that I could
see what was going on. I have seen GRUNSPAN beating prisoners there and tor
these beatings he used part of a rubber hose, with wire filling, a stick, or
anything available. The prisoner concerned had to bend over a table and was
then held down by policemen whilst GRUNSPAN carried out the beating. He beat
these prisoners on the back and buttocks for about 5 °r 10 minutes according to
the health and resistance of the prisoner concerned. On one occasion I saw
three or four prisoners waiting their turns to be beaten by GRUNSPAN. The
reason^ for these beatings was that either the prisoners' work was faulty or
their output of work was unsatisfactory to the Germans.
Whenever GHDNSPAN was not satisfied with a prisoner's work
or if he saw a man resting he would immediately report to a Capo who would then
allow GHUNSPAN to carry out a beating on this man similar to that which I have
described.
^	AH the camp policemen had a 'pool' in which they put the
private clothes which they took from the prisoners at a special parade. They
would tell the prisoners that such clothing was going into the store, but
actually it was either worn by the policemen themselves or sold by them to non-.
internee Polish workers who lived nearby.	.	^	^Aeofwe

Anny Group Interpreters Pool, sworn before Captain Alexander Mackinlay Forbes,
R.A., Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	On the instructions of Lieutenant Colonel Savile Geoffrey Chanpion,
R.A., Legal Staff, and Captain Ronald Percy Bentham-Green, R.A., Legal Staff,
both of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team,I endeavoured to trace the
whereabouts of the following witnesses who were called for by JOHANNA ROTH
to speak in her defence
EVA KRQNENEERG
HELENA KRONENBERG
FLORA WEISS
2.	On 7th. July 1945 I traced HELENA And EVA KRDNENEERG. On 7th. July 1945
and 12th. July 1945 respectively I accompanied the said HELENA and EVA
KRDNENBERG to Belsen Detention Cells where ih ity presence they saw JOHANNA
ROTH. Each said that they did not know her and were unable to give ary
O
evidence either for or against her.
3.	1 made enquiries on 7th. July 1945 at the Registration Office,

1,	I am 22 years of age and I joined the Hungarian Amy in September 1944*
I was first posted to the infantry and later to ny present regiment which was at
Belsexv ; ■ j.	v. j
2*	About two or three days before the English came to BelSen, NO.4 Company
was ordered to parade for guard duty at ffo.l Camp. This was due to the fact that
some of the S^. guards were leaving. On parade the Lieutenant of the Ccrapaiy,
Lieutenant DJVAKY,’ ‘ordered us to shbbt" "any prisoners who attempted to escape or
who came within 10 metres of -the wire. He further stated that any soldiers who
failed to carry out this order would be shot. Guards were then posted around the
wire, on the outside, about 100 metres apart*
3.	On the second day that we were on guard Lieutenant TUVAKY came about
mid-day to inspect the guard. At this time there was a big crowd of prisoners
around the cook-house. When Lieutenant UJVAHY saw this he took out his pistol
and fired into the crowd until his magizine, of seven bullets, was empty.
I saw several people fall to the ground but was sent away by Lieutenant UJVAEY
into the kitchen before I could see whether any had been killed or wounded.
About half an hour later I came out of the kitchen and I saw that a lot of
women prisoners were crying. I also saw that several of the men prisoners were
carrying bodies away to the huts. I do not know whether these people were
dead or just injured. A Hungarian woman prisoner asked me why the Lieutenant
had shot at them. She became very excited and showed me a bullet wound in her
left leg which she said she had received as a result of this shooting. I
do not know this women’s name. Lieutenant UJVAEY is a very strict officer and in
view of this I did not hang about and ask questions as to whether ary had been
killed or injured.

Vs <Vv CvClA^fl-o	fUfc.lv-.
1.	I am 2J years of age and I joined the Hungarian Amy in September
1943. I was forced to do this as that part of Rumania in which I lived was
anno-r^ by the Hungarians. I was posted to ny present regiment which came to
Germany and in November 1944 to Bel sen Camp.
2.	About two or three- days, befora the English came to Belsen I was
working in the office in M.B.22 of Belsen Camp when one of the soldiers came
to me and said that there was some shooting in No. 2 Camp. No. 2 Camp was
at that	being used as a concentration camp and an overflow £>r Camp No. 1.
I went to No. 2 Camp to see what was happening and I there saw Lieutenant UJVART
of the Hungarian Army, shoot two women prisoners who were near the wire that
surrounds the camp. Lieutenant UJVART did not call out to them to stop but
just shot them. The two women fell to the ground and lay still. I did not
see than taken away as I was so upset that I moved away.
3.	BSS On the day following the above incident I heard Lieutenant
before

MnTiNAR, a Hungarian Officer, and Cadet HAMDEI, also of the Hungarian Amy,
talking in the office. Lieutenant MOLNAR said
■where they could shoot at prisoners without being seen.^ They then went out
ti the^office and I followed them to Camp No. 1 where I saw them climb into
an observation tower. I then saw Lieutenant MOLNAR fire a machine gun into
a crowd of prisoners who were near the cook-house. Several of the prisoners
fell down and stayed there. I was so disgusted that I walked away and as I
was walking up the road I heard further machine gun fire flrom that direction.
None of the prisoners who were shot were anywhere near the wire and they were
not creating any disturbance. It was just wanton murder.

No,4 Company, 1st, Battalion, 1st, Hungarian Tank Regiment, stationed at
Belsen Camp,
2.	No,4 Company, commanded by Lieutenant UJVAHI, took over guard duties
in No.l Camp at lelsen from the SS on Friday, 13th, April 1945, two days
before the liberation of Belsen. I was second in command of the second
platoon. Lieutenant UJVARI addressed the Company on a parade that morning
and gave us the following orders:- (l) guards were to shoot any internees
coming nearer than 10 metres to the wire; (2). guards must take care not to
shoot into the crowd; (3) Guards were not to speak to internees; (4) failure
to carry out these orders would involve punishment by the Germans.
3.	’ During "that afternoon I heard guards shooting, but did not see if anyone
was hurt. These shots were fired by the other half of the guard, not by
mine. I da not know if there were any shootings after the liberation.
4,	During that afternoon Captain VISKIDENSKI, who was Commandant of the
Hungarian Guard, gave us fresh orders - that the SS orders no longer applied,
and guards were only to shoot internees if they were crossing the wire. This
was the last order givenjtantii the British took over: We were then told
to keep the internees inside the wire because of typhus, and not to shoot any
of them, but if there was no other means of keeping them in, to fire into the
air. The Hungarian officers then told the guards not to load their weapons.
5,	Lieutenant UTVAEf was sever; in his treatment of the soldiers. I have
never seen or heard of him shooting/a^inSrnfes; I have only seen him
striking Hungarian soldiers, and cannot say whether they deserted this or not,
6,	Second Lieutenant MOLNAR belonged to another Conpary. All I know about

2.	About noon on^the day before the English arrived^ny cousin Bella and
I were among a part of prisoners who wex-e going to collect carrots for themselves.
We had had no food for two days, and the Camp was quite in disorder. Between
Kitchen 1 and Kitchen 2 was a large pile of carrots, mostly rotten: we were
taking these and hiding them in our clothes for taking away. I was ^ust bending
down to pick some up when I heard a shot, and ny cousin, who was next to me,
collapsed. I looked up and saw a Hungarian Officer with two stars on his
collar holding a smoking pistol, in his hand. The crowd immediately dispersed,
leaving ny cousin behind. I also ran away and hid behind the bread store,
about 200 yards away, waiting to see what happened. About an hour later
this officer and the soldiers who were supposed to be guarding the carrots ,
but had not done anything about it, all went away. I then went back to see
what had happened to. ny cousin Bella. There wre some men internees standing
around her body. Her head was covered in blood and I could not beare to; look for

1.	I am a Hungarian and 1? years old, I was compelled by the
Germans to join the Levente, a youth organization, and as a member "of that
came to Braunschweig. On 25th February 1945 I was called up for the S.S. but
escaped to Belsen wiiere I reported to the Hungarian unit and became a soldier
in the Hungarian Army. I had ordinary duties at first and later was put on
guard duties. J ^	^
3
2.	5	I remember on 15th April 1945, about 2.p.m., I was standing
on guard on one comer of the place in front of the cook-house for men
internees. Another soldier named SOKPARI was on guard on another comer.
As the first British car came into Belsen Camp I saw 20 or 25 Polish internees
come out of their block and go into the cellar of tne kitchen.. A Hungarian
officer named PATO saw this and told two of the guards, named 3IP0S and
BRAUNITZER, to go down into the cellar and shoot the Poles. They refused
to do so. PATO thereupon took a guard’s rifle and himself went down into tne
cellar. I next heard three or four shots inside the cellar.	PATO then came
up out of the cellar and said • I have shot two of the Poles’.	He went away
then and inspected other guards.
About 7 o'clock that evening I saw other internees carrying
two dead Poles out of that cellar. , I saw for myself that they were aead: they
had bullet wounds near the heart.
4.	BRAUNITZER and SIPOS were later punished for disobeying
this order. They have escaped now and I think are back in Hungary.
On 10th July 1945, accompanied by No. 3/259166? Staff-
serjeant EMEST STANLEI CONNING, Royal Army Service Corps, Judge Advocate
General’s Branch, attached to No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team, I saw a
Hungarian officer whom I immediately identified as PATO. I saw him when
he was walking along the road from Bergen to Belsen in the company of another
Hungarian officer named UJVAHI and two British soldiers.

IN THE MATTER 0F WAR GRIMES

ATROCITIES AT BE[£EN
REPOSITION OP KAROLY MONEK (male) late of Szentgothard, Hungary, sworn before
Captain Alexander Mackinlay Forbes, R..A,, „ Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes
Investigation Team,
1,	I was born at Zsida, Hungary in 1919 and was conscripted into the Hungarian
Army on 2nd, December 1940, I am at present a serjeant in No,4 Company, 1st,
Battalion, 1st. Hungarian Tank Regiment, stationed';at Belsen Camp.
2,	My Company took over guard duties at No.l Camp, Belsen, on Friday, 13th.
April 1945. When the whole Conpany was on parade that morning Lieutenant UJVAEI
gave the Oder that guards were to shoot any internee who came nearer than ten
metres to the wire. Two or three days later Captain VTSKIDEHSKI said that
guards were only to shoot at internees if they were outside the wire or climbing
over it, and they were to aim so as to hit the escaping internee and no one else.
I passed this order on to the guards who Wei’s on duty.
3,	Several times I was N.C.O. of the guard on duly. Once I heard firing and
on making inquiries was told by one guard that he had fired at someone trying
to escape, I did not see that anyone was hurt or anyone hear the wire. I
heard quite a lot of firing that Friday evening, but did not see that anyone was
hurt and the guards said they had been firing into the air.
4* When the British came we received orders not to shoot or hit the internees
but if they were trying to get through the wire we were only to explain why
they were not allowed outside.
5.	Lieutenant UJYARY was disliked by the whole Corrpany because he treated the
soldiers badly. I do not know of him ill-treating any of the prisoners: He
U
was afraid because his men also disliked him, animalways went about with somebody
else. 3bckx
6.	I know that MOLNAR was a Second Lieutenant, but do not know anything about
him, I have never heard of a Cadet HAMOHI.

ALEXANDER MACKINLAJ FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War
Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am Hungarian and at present commanding No. 4 Coup any of the
1st Hungarian TanJj Regiment stationed at Belsen Camp. I went to the
Soldiers’ School at the age of 10 and was commissioned in November, 1944.
I arrived at Belsen Camp on the 5th December, 1944, when I was a Platoon
Commander in No, 5 Company. Ujvaiy arrived at about the end of December
and became the senior Lieutenant in my Company.
4r
2.	In the morning of the 15th April, 1945, No. ^Company took
up guard duties at No. 1 Camp at Belsen. I was Ujvaiy’s first officer^*-.
Captain Kiraly was in charge of the whole guard, but was succeeded that
afternoon by Captain Wiskidensky. We took our first orders from the
German Guard. Commander, Captain Baumgarten. I acted as interpreter
between him and Ujvaiy and remember that we were told the guards were to
shoot any internees who came nearer than ten metres to the wire, that
they were not to let the internees form a crowd or gather round the kitchens.
These orders were given to the whole Company on parade by Ujvaiy: I do not
remember if I was present at this parade. The guard towers were manned
by German troops. Between the towers there were two Hungarian guards
outside the wire, and inside the Camp there were two Hungarian guards by
each of the three kitchens and two more by the food store.
3.	That afternoon Captain Wiskidensky gave us fresh orders.
Guards were only to shoot internees if they had got over the wire and
there was no other means of preventing their escape. Those were the last
orders we received before the liberation.
^	X aid not myself see any guards shoot the internees.
Sometime at night I heart shots: tat I never found anyone who had been
hurt. On changing guart I severtl ttaes found the anmunition was

I have never seen or heard, of Ujvary shooting an internee.
On duty he was always with somebody, usually myself, and so we must have
known if he had. Further, the guards were only 50 metres apart and if
he had shot anyone they must have seen it.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
and
THE DEFENCE OF LIEUTENANT UJVAHY
DEPOSITION of CAPTAIN GEORG WISKIDENSKY, Hungarian, at
present serving as Adjutant of the Central School, Hungarian Tank Regiment,
stationed at BELSEN Camp, sworn before Captain Alexander Mackinlay FORBES,
Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I first met LIEUTENANT UJVARY on the 13th April 1945,
when I was sent up to No 1 Camp at BELSEN to replace Captain KERALY, who
was in charge of the Hungarian Guard there, and who had gone sick. I
arrived there about four o'clock in the afternoon and found LIEUTENANT
UJVARY on duty. He told me that his orders frctn the Germans were
that the guards were to shoot any of the internees who came too close
to the wire, as they were criminals and sick with Typhus. I was sur-
prised at this, because it is not like a Hungarian to use his arms in
such a case, and issued fresh orders that the Hungarian guards were
not to shoot the internees. I sent these orders round the Hungarian
guards by messenger on a bicycle. UJVARY and I then went round
inspecting all the Hungarian guards, and the conditions I saw behind the
*
wire confimed my opinion that ray order not to shoot the internees was
the correct order; there was no one trying to escape. As we went round
UJVARY in my presence told each Hungarian guard that he was not to
shoot the internees. I then held an Officers' Conference at which I
ordered that no guards were to shoot the internees, but also that they
were not to talk to them or have dealings with them.
2.	I know that UJVARY carried out my orders. It is
possible, however, that he acted contrary to them without ny knowledge;
in that event I should expect to see him punished for disobedience. I
have not seen him shoot or ill treat any of the internees. A few days
*
after the 13th April 1945 I heard soldiers and internees saying that
UJVARY had given orders for internees to he shot. I thereupon ordered
a parade of ny troops and called on any men to come forward who had shot
internees in consequence of this order. No one came forward. I mentioned﻿this to UJVARY, who said that possibly some soldier or some internee
from his home was trying to make trouble for him.
X remained in charge of the guard for about three
weeks. In that time UJVARY and I became good friends. He was a good
soldier and a gentleman but his men did not like him because he was severe.

I was told that I must send a Hungarian Guard to Camp Ho. 1
at 8.30 a.m., and to give some Guards to Camp No. 2.

and not No. 1, 2 or 3 Company?
I cannot remember by whan it was decided.

Q. 39.
But that does not answer ay question. My question was:
Did you know on the 12th April that there were a large number
of women and children in the Canqp?
No. At that time, when I got this order, I was told by these
people that they must be very careful as there were some
criminals and some sick people, and it was very dangerous to
let these people go.
I should be very glad if you would concentrate on the questions.
Did you know on the 12th April of the atrocities which had
been committed by the Germans in the Concentration Camp here?
Captain Viskidenski told me what happened in the Camp.
Do you mean that he told you after the 12th April or before the
12th April?
About the 13th or 14th April.
My question was: did you know on the 12th April that the
Germans had been committing atrocities in Belsen Concentration
Camp?
No: absolutely not.
Were you not well aware that atrocities had been committed for
many years by the Germans in Concentration Camps throughout
Germany?
Yes, I have been told so.
Did you believe it was true?
Yes.
Do I understand that the orders to No. 4 Company of your
Regiment were given to them by a German?
Yes, because the Germans were ccamianding.
Knowing what you did of the conduct of the Germans in
Concentration Camps, did you not consider it your duly at
least to find out what orders were being given to your troops?
I thought that the prisoners were criminals - dangerous and
inferior men.
What did you think the women were?
I did not know that there were any women in the Camp.
When did you have a report of the orders that your troops had
been firing at prisoners.
After the 14th April when I received a report from Captain
Viskidenski.
Was that report in writing?
By telephone.
You know that it is alleged that your Hungarian troops between
the 12th April and the date when the British arrived
murdered some of the prisoners? Was it not your duty to
go to the Camp when the guard was detailed and see what your
guard were doing?

Q. 48.
Do you hold yourself as the Colonel of the Regiment to be
responsible for what your troops do?
All that happened in No. 1 Camp must be the responsibility of
the Company Commander but not of myself.
Was the Company Ccumiander Captain Viskidenski?
It was Lieutenant Kiraly.
But are you not as the Colonel of the Regiment responsible for
all your officers?
I
When I was told of what happened in Camp No. 1, I sent Captain
Viskidenski there.
But who told you of what had happened in Camp No. 1?
Captain Viskidenski told me.
What did he tell you had happened in Camp No. 1?
These orders (produced by Colonel Balo) are signed by Captain
Viskidenski for the 14th April, 1945.
Did Captain Viskidenski report to you that the Hungarian guards
were shooting the prisoners?
No.
Did he report that he had had orders that any prisoners who
came within ten metres of the wire were to be shot?
Yes.
What did you do when you heard that he had had those orders?
I gave orders that the instructions were to be changed and I
produced the orders issued by Captain Viskidenski as a result
of my instructions to him.
Were your orders to Captain Viskidenski in writing or verbally?
A. 48. I cannot remember.
Q. 49. Would you look in your records and if it was in writing let me
have the written order?
A. 49. Yes. I now remember it was verbal.
Q. 50. I cannot understand why you did not yourself go down and see
what your troops were doing at the Concentration Camp.
A. 50. This Company has got a Commandant and I had nothing to do with
the troops.
Q. 51.	But surely, were you not the Colonel who commanded the Regiment?
A. 51.	Yes, but I am a high commanding officer, and it was nothing
to do with me.
Q. 52. How many men are there in one of your Companies?
A. 52. Between 120 and 150.
Q. 53. How many Companies are there in your Regiment?
A. 53. Eight Companies.

Concentration Camp every day, several times a day. -'Olonel

not obliged to visit the Camp.

Yes.
We require the order book of No. 4 Company. Would you please
write me out an order forthwith for it?
I do not know whether the book is there.
Will you write out an order now for its immediate delivery to
my police? (C0L0NEL altoRJAY complied)
jf your troops were employed at the Concentration Camp, did
you not think it your duty to visit the Camp and find out
what your troops were required to do?
The German Commanding Officer was responsible for the Guard,
and I did not consider it to be my duty - but I went
afterwards.
Do you know that your guards in fact received orders to shoot
in circumstances which amount to murder?
I do not know.
I want to be quite clear in your answer to this: is it true
that you, yourself, consider that you had no duty as to

The German Commander of the Concentration Camp.
But they were your troops being used, not his troops?

in the camp.

ZZ troops where women and children were concerned?
I could not imagine what could happen in such a Concentration
Camp; therefore, I gave no orders.

and including many children -
the majority of them women
have been murdered?

DEPOSITION of ALADAR SOL^i (Male) late of BUDAPEST, HUNGARY,
sworn before Captain Alexander Mackinlay Forbes^ Royal Artillery, Legal
Staff, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am a Hungarian and am 2k years of age. I was a
Student of Law at F0CS. I was conscripted into the Hungarian Army on the
25 th November 1944 and arrived in BEL SEN on the 11th December 194k. At
first I was in the Officers' School, but in March 1945 I was posted to
No 4 Company, where X performed normal duties but was also often employed
to do typing.
2.	I remember,on the morning of the 13th April 1945, typing
a set of Guard Orders dictated to me by HETENYI. These orders detailed
the guards' dress et cetera and forbade the guards to speak to the internees
or have dealings with them. They also stated that if an internee came
nearer than ten metres to the wire the guard was to shoot.
3.	That day I went on parade with No 4 Company and saw
a German officer speak: to Second Lieutenant LEGEZA, who then told us that
when guards shot they must aim to kill. .
4.	Some five or six days later I typed a different set
of guard orders, of which I recognise Exhibit 'A' now produced and shown to
me, as a copy.	I copied them from a sheet in Lieutenant UJVARY's handwriting.
This was on the 18th or 19th April 1945} the copy bears the date 14th April
1945 because that was the date of the original. I made four copies, but
cannot remember who received them.
5.	The orders about shooting contained in Exhibit 'A'
are different from those dictated to me by HETENYI on the 13th April 1945,
This latter set provides that guards are not to shoot into the Camp
and that they are only to shoot at internees if they are coming across the
wire; even then they must not aim to kill but must rather let the internee
escape than killhinu﻿I do not know if the guards ever actually received

this second set of orders.

At 1500 hours on Saturday lA-th July 1945 I went By car from the

office of Np. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team, Belsen Camp to the North gate. I
took with me two Hungarian soldiers who were Being returned to protective custody
after interrogation. I also had with me a Hungarian interpreter named GlORGY
REICHENBERG. I pulled up at the North gate and instructed REICHENBERG to return
the two Hungarians to the guard room. When he came from the guard room he
crossed the road to speak to a Hungarian officer who had called to him. I
pulled over to that side of the road and EEICHENBERG entered the car. At this
time I was directly opposite the Headquarters Building of the Hungarian Battalion.
Prom the door of this Building I saw a soldier in Hungarian uniform merge
carrying a huge pile of papers. He crossed the road and took tnese papers to a
large Bonfire which was Burning amongst the trees. He placed the papers on the
Bonfire. I then drove round to No. 4 Company, Hungarian Army, where I deposited
a receipt for documents impounded and on returning to the North gate I could see
that the Bonfire was Blazing more fiercely than ever. On returning to the of 1 ice

Regiment
Is that a different/from that commanded by Colonel BALO?
I am in command of the Regiment and Colonel BALO is in
command of the School. Colonel Balo is my superior officer.
I an not clear. Arg there here a Hungarian Tank Regiment,
and also a Hungarian Tank School?
Yes. To the Tank School belonged a Tank Regiment and an
Infantry Regiment, which is no longer here.
'When did the Infantry Regiment leave?
The Infantry Regiment was in part carried off by the Germans
in batches because the soldiers were given work digging
ditches, and so on.
Were there any of the Infantry Regiment still here on the
12th April?
The Infantry Regiment was never here at Bergen but at a Camp
at Monster, only it was under the command of that School.
'What was the number and name of the Infantry Regiment?
No number. The name in Hungarian was: Lovesz Kikipzo
Ezred (An Infantry Musketry Training School).
WL&t was the number and name of the Tank Regiment here.
Tank School Regiment: it had no number.
When did you arrive at Belsen?
On the 5th December, 1944.
Colonel Balo has told me that he arrived on the nth or 12th
December, 1944, and that on his arrival he (Colonel Balo)
commanded the Panzer Shooting School.
Colonel Balo arrived about the middle of December. Before
the arrival, as wen as after the arrival of Colonel Balo,
I was in command of the Tank School Regiment. But on the
arrival of Colonel Balo, Colonel Balo was superior to me.
Balo acted as Brigadier.
?/hat did Colonel ALTORJAY act as?
/A. 13﻿- 2 -
A. 13. ALTORJAT was not here then. He only came in February,
and then Colonel ALTORJAY commanded both me and Colonel Balo,
being superior to both of us.
Q. 14. Colonel Balo told me that he was in canmand of_the Hungarian
Regiment and was responsible for its discipline and the
carrying out of any orders received.
A. 14. Yes. He was responsible for the discipline and the carrying
out of orders in both of the Regiments.
Q. 15. But as I understand it, you were the Colonel who was immediately
commanding the Tank Regiment?

Q. 21.
A. 21.
Q. 22.
A. 22.
Yes.
Were you in that position on the 12th April, 1945?
I was in command of the Regiment only until the end of.March,
1945. Then the Germans created an authority for maintaining
order; and then Colonel Balo took over the command, of the
Regiment. I was only charged with the administration of the
Regiment.
Were orders received by your Regiment to supply a Guard for the
Concentration Camp on the 12th April?
Authority for keeping order, which I mentioned before., was
ordered on the 10th April to provide the Concentration Camp
here with Guards. The only men taken out of my Regiment
were those who were provided with rifles, but about 500 men
without rifles remained under my command. Colonel Ealo,
who was charged with keeping order, was in charge of providing
the Concentration Camp with Guards, which he did.
This is the order I received then (letter produced by
Colonel BercsAnyi).
What were the orders mentioned therein which you had not been
able to carry out?
I could not cany out any orders because I had not the men
necessary for it, and I did not receive any orders. It was
not my fault and only by mistake that I received the oroer.
What were the orders dated the 10th April to which this letter
refers?
My Companies and smaller units were taken away xn batches from
me so I remained only with one officer and his adjutant and
all the orders were issued directly to those units taken away.
That is the reason I applied to my superior to let me know
the orders because 1 could not carry out any oraers if I did
not know thou.
Have you now received a copy of the orders of the 10th April?
never received any copy of the orders.
ave you any other documents which you wish me to see?
n connection with this question, only this document which
I have already produced. If possible I.should like to hav
^	returned to me as I may be m need of it.
We need this original document, hut we will supply you with
a copy.
Perhaps I shall have to answer before an Hungarian authority
and will need it.

The original will he	in the hands of the British
authorities but it will be available to you if you require
it for your own purposes. What is the other document
you have in your hand?
It is a copy of the original document, but I should like to
have a copy confirmed by the British authorities.
I will let you have it. What responsibility did you have
in respect of supplying the Guard Company for the
Concentration Camp?
I had no responsibility.
Were you responsible for issuing ammunition?
No. It was not my duty and I was not responsible. I
submitted the letter to prove that I had no knowledge of
the issue of the orders. I was ordered to visit the Allied
lines and to agree upon surrender on the 11th April. It
was on the 11th and 12th April - then I was with the
English. There were some English and Canadian pilots
who were shot down and I guarded them and took them with me
when I went to the British lines as an emissazy. Afterwards
the Hungarian Command knew of it and they approved of it
afterwards because I had succeeded in my mission.
When did you return to Belsen?
About 6 or 7.30 p.m. on the 12th April, together with a
British General who proceeded back to his troops. I
remained here.
As the officer in charge of administration, are you in charge
of the Regimental documents?
Yes. I was responsible for the administration and for
keeping the orders and documents, but before the arrival
of the Allied troops all records were destroyed.
How were they destroyed?
All the papers and records were burned.
On whose orders was this done?
On German orders which I received through Colonel Balo.
Have you still got the written order which Colonel Altorjay
gave to Colonel Balo on the 12th April in regard to the
guards at the Concentration Camp?
Of this order I had no knowledge, because it was issued
directly, and I knew nothing of it. Therefore I made
the report when I heard of.it afterwards. The soldiers
of my Regiment were dispersed in various spots, and so,
beincr detached for various duties, some of the soldiers
formed the Guard., and those units received the orders
directly and I bad no knowledge of the order, and only
afterwards did I know of it. Here is the copy of another
report which I submitted on the 24th April to the Hungarian
Garrison Commander at Bergen on the 24th April. I have
no knowledge of the order issued on the 10th April, and
therefore I could not carry it out. I asked to be told
of the order.
Did you know that No. 4 Company had been detailed to go to
the Concentration Camp?
/A. 31.﻿- 4 -
A. 31. I learned it afterwards about the l?th April when I went
around to control my units. Then I spoke with two officers,
one named VISKIDENSKI and UJVARI: Ujvari was in command
of No. 4 C/ompany. Then I asked what they were doing there,
and they said they were in charge of the Guard. I asked
whether they were well fed. The British Guards were there
and I was not permitted to enter the Camp at all.
Q.. 32. As I understand it, you say that you were responsible only for
administration and not for any action taken by any of the
Companies.
A. 32. Yes, I was responsible for administration only and for no
actions. I supplied the units with food and medical
supplies, and was in charge of the sick.
Q. 33. Was Ujvari a Captain or a Lieutenant?

What did Captain KIEALY command?
Captain Kiraly, being a sick man, was in command of the unit
for only four or five hours. He was then replaced by
Captain VISKIDENSKI.
Before the 12th April had you been in the Concentration Camp?
I did not know of the existence of the Concentratioi^fcamp before.
Is it not very strange that you were here for over three months
within a mile of the Camp and did not know it existed?
It is strange, but I was not allowed to pass a certain point.
Sometimes I saw bread transported from the Bakery.to somewhere
where it was said there was a Camp. I saw Russian
prisoners in green suits and I knew that there was a Camp
here but I did not know what kind of Camp. Immediately
before I started to go to the British Troops, then I was
informed by the German Commander HARRIES of the existence
of the Concentration Camp, because I was told that ^
addition to the Russian prisoners there were approximately
65,000 people who have fallen ill with typhus.
When you found you were not permitted beyond a certain point
were you not suspicious as to what was happening?
I was told that there was a Camp with sick people, but X admit
I was not much interested in what was there.
Did you guess that the sick people were in fact civilian
prisoners?
I had no knowledge of it and I did not ask, but once in
conversation it transpired that I was told that there was a
Camp for convicted German soldiers there.
Am I right in saying that it was general knowledge that the
gLSS had for mSny years been emitting atrocities in
their Concentration Camps?
I do not knew whether it was a general opinion, but I had no
knowledge of it. I knew that there were Concentration
Camps in Hungary, too, but I believed they existed only
for guarding those people but without any atrocities.
Do you seriously wish me to believe that you had no knowledge
and had heard no information that the Germans had for years
^en committing atrocities in their Concentration Camps?

Q. 49*
I heard about the existence of Concentration Camps in general,
but I did not know what it meant and the life in them.
Are you aware that the whole world knew except yourself?
Only on the 17th April when I afterwards had a look at the
liberated Concentration Camp was it that I became aware of
the meaning of it. Before, I supposedthat Concentration
Camps were only for guarding those people whom the authorities
wanted to detain. In Hungary the press was under control
and the press could never write about such matters as
Concentration Camps.
What was your opinion when you went into the Concentration Camp
on the 17th April?
It was horrible. I sent potatoes while the Germans were here,
on every vehicle available, to the Concentration Camp,
because I learned there were prisoners of war there starving
and that I did it against the wish of the German authorities,
and therefore I was reprimanded by a German Captain named
BACKER. The first 15 carts with potatoes I sent to the
Camp by Lieutenant CIGLENYI, who was ordered to transport
the quantities of potatoes to the Concentration Camp.
When was this?
I do not remember the correct date, but the Germans were still here.
If you had been responsible for detailing a Company for a
Concentration Camp, would you have considered it your duty
to have known what orders were given to that Company?
Yes, obviously.
Would you have considered it your duly to visit the Guard at
the Concentration Gamp?
Certainly. If someone is in command of a Unit he must control it.
It is his duty.
I am putting these questions to you as if you were a Colonel
commanding a Regiment and had sent a Company to the Camp.
The first duty of the Commander of a Regiment who sends a Company
to. a Concentration Camp is to control the Company.
Would you consider that an order to shoot prisoners whilst still
within the Camp was a proper order to give.
T was not aware of the circumstances in the Concentration Camp,
?here£re I cannot give a direct answer to this question.
For instance, if the guard were attacked by the prisoners I
would issue an order to shoot, but not without necessity.
Would vou consider it necessary for guards to shootfrom
outside the wire at prisoners who approached within ten
metres of the inside of the wire?
I would not regard it as being necessary. As a soldier I
cannot understand why'a guard should shoot at a dist
often metres when barbed wire is between. 1 cannot under
stand it.
Would you be surprised to hear that those were the orders
received and carried out by Hungarian troops.
From whom did the Hungarian soldiers receive such an order?

The oi'der was issued, hy the G-sirii.-in CoTnni3Jid.e3r passed on
by Hungarian officers.
If such an order were received from the Germans then the
Gennan commander is responsible for issuing the order,
as the Hungarian troops were under German command.
Do you consider that there is no responsibility attaching
to the Hungarians for obeying such orders?
No, because they are soldiers .
Is it your opinion that if a soldier receives an order to do
an illegal act he should obey the order?
According to the Hungarian Regulations, a soldier must carry
out any order received from his superiors apart from the
question of whether they were legal or not, and the superior
only is responsible for the carrying out^this order.
Would the answer apply if the order were to murder somebody?
If I were ordered to commit murder I would not carry it out.
Supposing Hungarian troops were ordered to commit murders,
according to your previous answers that would be doing
their duty in carrying out those orders.
There is a difference between murdering and carrying out the
duties of a guard.
Would you please answer the question?
I do not Know that it is explicitly stated in Hungarian
Military Regulations, but it is my opinion that if somebody
gets an order to commit murder he has to report it to his
superiors before carrying it out. Hat it .is quite another
thing if I have to kill somebody whilst carrying out my
duties as a guard. For instance: if a prisoner tries
to escape.
Would that also apply to a woman prisoner?
A woman or man: it is all the same. The Guard has to shoot
if somebody is trying to escape.
Does that apply to a child prisoner?
In vny opinion, if a child tried to escape there would be no
necessity to shoot him because a child could be prevented
from escaping in other ways. One has to act according .-o
common sense.
Is it the usual conduct of the Hungarian Amy to shoot women?
No. Such events in the Hungarian Army have not been known.
When did you first know that Hungarian troops had committed
murders in the Concentration Camp?
[ Aever heard of it until now.
Go you not knew that two of your officers are under arrest
for murder?
Yes I know that two Hungarian officers are under arrest
^because one allegedly shot thirty and the other four
prisoners, but I was never before told of it.

Are you in command of the administration side?
Only in my Regiment.
Who is responsible for the destruction of those papers?
I want the name of the Colonel?
I have no knowledge of any papers having been destroyed
yesterday. What kind of papers were they - otherwise
I cannot answer the question?
Who is the Colonel who commands the Headquarters in which
the papers were being destroyed?
There is no Headquarters here. The Colonels have separate
functions. Colonel Bale is in command of the Hungarian
Regiment here; I am in command of the administration;
and Colonel Altorjay is in Command of the garrison.
Would you mind answering my question? Which Colonel is
responsible for the safe custody of the documents in the
building in which they were being burned?
Every Colonel is responsible for the safeguarding of the
documents relating to his function.
Have any of the documents for which you are responsible been
destroyed yesterday?
No.
You will appreciate that the worst possible construction
will be placed upon the destruction of any further papers
of any kind.
Yes, I understand.
Will you give immediately the necessaiy orders to ensure
that your papers are safeguarded?
Yes.
You will be held personally responsible by the British
authorities for so doing. Do you understand?
Yes, I understand and I will safeguard my documents.
Having seen the Concentration Camp on the 17th April are
you now happy that Hungarian troops were used there before
the British came?
No, I am not happy about it, and I said before, too, that
no more shameful duty could be given to the Hungarian
troops.
Have you any explanation why Hungarian troops carried out
such a shameful duty?
I regarded it as shameful only 'when I saw afterwards, on
the 17th April, but when the duty was given to the
Hungarian troops they did not know what duty it was.
They knew only that it was to guard the Concentration Camp,
Was it not obvious upon the arrival of the Hungarian guards
that the duty assigned to them was shameful?
On the 17th April, when I learned in what way the Hungarian
troops had been used I regarded it as though the Geiraans
had wanted to make them ashamed. That was my opinion
afterwards.

DEPOSITION OF JOZSEF FORGACH(male) late of TISZAPOLGAR, HUNGARI, sworn before
Captain Alexander Mackinlay Forbes, R.A., Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation

I am a Hungarian and 32 years old. My civil employment was as a
1.
motor-mechinic until I enlisted in the Hungarian Army in 193^•	I have been the
Chief Clerk in the office of No,A Company, 1st, Hungarian Tank Regiment, stationed
at Belsen for the last two months ,
I recognise the Exhibit marked ‘A’ now produced and shown to me
2,
as the order given to me by Second Lieutentant BIBO on 12th, July 1945* to enter
in the Secret Order Register; The words "Draft - for private use" written at the
top right hand corner I recognise as being in Captain Wiskidensky* s hand-writing,
and were there when I first saw the order,
I recognise the Exhibit marked ’B* now produced and stiown to me
as the Secret Order Register mentioned in paragraph 2, The orders have been
entered in the order of their receipt, so that the last entry is the document
latest received. The only entry made by myself in this book is the entry at
the top of the third page: all the earlier entries were made by the previous
chief clerk, named Gombaszogi, who is now a deserter,
A,	The book is ruled as follows
The first two columns are headed ‘Correspondence’, and the first
■	, A
contains the Company Serial Number, the second is for the Sender’s Serial Number,
The third and fourth columns are headed ‘Incoming Orders’, column three is for the
date on the order, column 4 for the Sender's Reference Number. The fifth column
is the subject matter. Columns six and seven are headed ’Disposal’, and the
sixth column is for the date when action was taken, column seven, ±or what
action was taken. The seventh column, however, has in fact always been used
J
for a single-word summary of the subject matter.
In the entry made by me on the top of page three the date of the
5.
order was originally put in as 12th. July 1945 because there was no date on the
order, and the 12th. July was the date on which I received it. I asked BIBO
what date to put down in the ’Disposal’ column and he told me to put 17th. April
1945 and then said that I must change the date of the order in coluim three to
15th. April 1945. I accordingly made the alteration. I have put a dash in
Column 4 because there was no Sender’s Reference Number on the order.﻿X cannot say -why I started a new page. I agree it would have
been usual to make the fresh entry after the previous one. Number 14.
7.	I see that there has been pencil writing on page three, and that
it has been rubbed out. This page was in that condition when I first saw it.
I do not know what the writing was, or who wrote it, or who rubbed it out.

without any warning he fired at ny friend Doctor SCHONSTEIN, who fell down

SCHONSTEIN was still alive, fired two more shots into his body. I tried to

War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am a German and 2*4 years of age. I am a farmer. I was
employed as an Oberschlitze^- on the staff at Bergen-Belsen Camp from
December, 192*1, to October, 1942. The camp was then known as Stalag XI.C.
2.	Between December, 192*1, and October, 1942, about 10,000 Russian
prisoners died, mostly from a typhus epidemic but some from tuberculosis.
In December, 192*1, there were 22,000 men in the Camp, but in October, 192*2,
only between 1,000 and 1,500 remained. The other survivors had been
transferred to Labour Camps. I do not know whether everything was done for
these prisoners that could have been done, as I have no medical experience
and was merely a soldier of the guard.
3.	The Russians were buried in mass graves at the side of the road
between H0ERSTEN and MEISSEND0RF; between 100 and 250 corpses were
buried in each grave. I was employed in the cemetery and arranged for the
corpses to be buried by other Russian prisoners.
4	Oberst LUCIUS commanded Stalag XI.C. between about May, 1942,
and October, 1942, during which time between 1,000 and 1,500 Russian
prisoners died. Lieutenant-General TESCHNER commanded Stalag XI between
December, 1941, and October, 1942. SUleg XI ms used mirly as a hospital

I am 19 years of age and of German nationality, I have known

FORGACH, with whom I have- ■rodoyconfronted, for three weeks; I
met him at a dance and I became friendly with him.
PORGACH handed to me a number of documents and photographs three
2.
days ago and told me to conceal them and retain them as souvenirs,- He never
suggested that I should give them back to him. I lied when I was first
interrogated about the documents, because PORGACH told me to conceal the
papers. He also said he had burnt some papers.
He told me that he had killed many Jews. He never mentioned the
shooting of Russians on the Eastern Front and indeed I did not know he had
been to Russia. He also said that the Hungarian Officers at present in
custody had killed many Jews, I am certain that I did not misunderstand
PORGACH as he can make himself understood in German.

p#	I am 21 years of age and am a Jew. I was arrested hy the
local police at Marmorosch Sziget, Hungary, on 11th April 1944 and taken to
Auschwitz Concentration Camp. This was during a general round-up of all
Jewish people. I remained there for a short time only because, as I was a
skilled carpenter I was transferred to a Labour Camp in Silesia. I then
passed through various Camps and finally arrived at Belsen about 4th April
1945.

being beaten ly POLANSKI that he was taken to Hospital. I believe that he
died as a result of this beating for I have not been able to trace him.
I have not yet recovered from the beating which POLANSKI gave me on this
occasion and still hear the following wounds:- a deep cut on ny head, an
infected wound on ny right hand and a deep wound on rty right leg. In

I*	I am 21 years of age and, because I am a Jew, I was arrested
by the Germans on 7"tb May 1.3hk- and taken to the Ghetto in Szitumare where I
remained for three weeks. On 1st June 194^- I was sent to Auschwitz, remained
there for four days and was then sent to Wustegersdorf Labour Gang?. On l6th
February 1945 I passed through Hildesheim and arrived at Hanover on l6th
March 1945 and on 7th April 1945 I came to Belsen.
2,	’	Qn 4th July 1945, accompanied by No. 13041777 Serjeant
ERIC GEORGE STANLET, Pioneer Corps, 21st Army Group Interpreters Pool, I
visited Belsen Detention Cells where I identified a man as ANTON POLANSKI
whom I first met at Belsen. He was Assistant Block Leader of Block 12,
Camp 1, Belsen Concentration Camp. I lived in this block.
I remember that very early in the morning of 8th April
1945 we had to get up to bury a large number of dead. As we came from
the Block we had to pass a group of men. Amongst this group was POLANSKI.
As we passed them they beat us. POLANSKI beat us particularly hard with a
leather belt which had on it a metal buckle. Mary of the men fell down as

a result of these beatings.
POLANSKI frequently beat prisoners with a wooden club.
I remember on the morning of 15th April 1945 the work of burying the
dead was not progressing fast enough because the prisoners were so weak from
hunger. POLANSKI picked on a Pole named JACOBOVITSCH who was working near
me and who was in a very weak condition. He started to beat this man with
ds wooden club. JACOBOVITSCH sat down and said that he

DEPOSITION OP SANDOR UIGEL (Male^ late of Rahov/o. Prortstr, 2517j Czechoslovakia,
sworn before Caffitsdn W-iTry.iWiTDBIl ?.tt.(iMINLAgf- POIBEOy feoyal Artillery, Legal Staff,
No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 21 years of age and, because I am a Jew I was arrested in
Marmorosch Sziget in April 19Vf By the local police. It was a general round-up of
all the Jews. I was taken to Auschwitz but was there only a short time when I
was transferred to a Labour Camp in Silesia. I then passed through various camps
7th	\
and arrived at Belsen on KZR/April 1945*

2.	On 1st July 1945 I noticed a man in kitchen No. 6 in Caup 3,
Belsen Camp, whom I recognized as ANTON POLANSKI who had been the assistant
block leader of the block in which I lived in Belsen. At the time I saw him I
was with MENDEL. PUGHS. POLANSKI, when he saw us, tried to get away but with
the assistance of some British soldiers we caught him and took him to the Military
Police.
3.	I was in Camp 1, Block 12, Belsen and POLANSKI was the
assistant block leader. One day early in April 1945 about 3»a*m. we were all
called out of our block. Grouped round the doorway there were several men one
/	V
of whom was POLANSKI. They were all aimed with wooden clubs or rubber
truncheons or leather belts and as we filed past them we were all beaten. I
myself was beaten on the head and neck with a rubber truncheon wedded by
POLANSKI. I had a deep red mark around ny neck for some time after the beating.
being
'iVhile I was/beaten I fell down and POLANSKI continued to beat me and at the same
time kicked me in the body with his heavy boots. He shouted that I did not want
to work and still continued to beat me. I managed to get on ny feet and worked
the rest of the day carrying corpses. There was no apparent reason for this
beating.
4.	On the following day I was engaged on the same work but in
order to avoid direct contact with the dead bodies we covered our hands with
small pieces of cloth. When POLANSKI noticed, this he took the cloth, which had
already been in contact with dead bodies, from ny hands and stuffed it into ny
mouth.

5#	For the next few days I tried to avoid POLANSKI as much as
poWible as I was scared of what he might next do to me. Early in the
morning of 15th April, the day on which the British arrived, he saw me with some
of my friends.	He followed us, driving us on all the time. He was carrying
a wooden club.	He shouted that all the corpses had to he removed from sight.
In my party there was a Pole named JACOBOVITSCII who was very weak. He was
aged about 40 and was a cobbler.	POLANSKI started to shout at him to make him
move more quickly, and then started to beat him with the club, JACdBOVITSCH
fell down and cried out ' I can’t carry «es any longer'. POLANSKI continued to
beat him with his club until JACOBOVTTSCH died. POLANSKI then ordered myself
and other prisoners to drag the body to the large pit and to drop it in, which

we did.

lt	. I am 28 years of age and, because I am a Jewess, I was arrested
on 2?th March 1942 and taken to Auschwitz. On 27th January 1945 I came to
Belsea.
2.	I recogiise No. 3 on photograph Z/4/2 as a Capo at Auschwitz.
I knew her hy the name of EUDE LOHBAUER and I have now Been told that that is
her correct name. One morning in August 1942 I was one of a party of women
who were assembled preparatory to being marched to work. W* were near the
perimeter of the Camp where there was a ditch and a barbed wire surround. The
ditch was about 2 metres from the barbed wire, about JsT 'to 4 metres wide and
about 3 metres deep. It was half filled with water. The barbed wire was
electrified. In the ditch, struggling in the water, I saw between 10 ana 20
women and there were about 10 bodies, apparently dead, floating on the surface
of the water. LOHBAUER, another Capo named KRAUSE (now dead), three or four
other female Capos and an S.S. Unterscharfuhrer were standing on the bank of
this ditch. LOHBAUER and KRAUSE had long poles in their hands. Some of the
women in the water were ciying desperately for help and I heard one xn
particular shout 'Capo, pull me out*. LOHBAUER said -Get hold of this- and
held out the pole. The woman grasped it and LOHBAUER pulled her half-way out.
Then with a downward thrust of the pole pushed the woman back into the water.
She and the other Capos were highly amused and LOHBAUER did this with several
other women. I watched this scene for about 20 minutes and was then marched
out of camp with the other workers. When I returned in the evening the ditch

before GagtaferAl^candor-MaeMnlay-RorbeB, Royal Aybi-llony, Legal Staff,
No 1 V/ar Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 22 years of age and a Hungarian. My civilian employment
was as a ganger on the -railway. I was dtenscripted into the Hungarian Army
on the 29th August 19AA, and employed in digging trenches in Southern Hungary
until the end of November. I then became a uniformed soldier and arrived at
BELSEN on the 5th December 19-44, where I was first in .the Second Company
of the Tank Regiment, and later was transferred to No 4 Company.
2.	A day or so before the liberation I was on guard duty in
No 1 Camp and my post was outside the wire surround. I was speaking to a
Hungarian woman who was: inside the wire, when Lieutenant UJVARY came up
and ordered me to send the woman away. I did not do so, and he then
waved her to go away. The ■woman then said it was pleasant to speak with
a Hungarian after so long a time. UJVARY drew his pistol andtold me that
if this happened again he would punish me and hand me over to the Germans.
He then shot at the woman and went away. The woman fell down; she was.
covered with blood, and appeared to be injured in the thigh. As I had
to go away a minute or so later I told her to go to the Hospital Block.
3.	I saw this woman again a few days later; she was in bed in
her own Block when I was helping to distribute tea. She seemed to be very
ill. I do not know her1 name, and have not seen or heard of her again.

With reference to the recent orders received from the
Hungarian. CosiiBAndihere, I report that I could not control the carrying
out of such orders by the Tank Regiment under r<*y command, by reason of
the fact that I had no knowledge of them.
I hereby request that all orders and instructions shall be
transmitted exclusively through the Regimental Command.
I have therefore instructed my Battalion Commanders.that I
have requested the transmission of all orders through me, to simplify unity
of command and control.
I wished to report orally on this roatter to fcne Snooting
School Commander at 1610 hours.

m0 the Command of the Tank Training Regiment.
20 Bergen-Celle, Apr 23, 1945.*
Bergen.
With reference to the essential part of your report,
according to the instructions in force (para. 11, Amy Regulations.
I make the following remarks:-
According to the instructions dated 10 April, 1945, the
Commander of the Shooting School is by this order.in charge of a special
unit responsible for maintaining order, so that since that time all
attached units are directly under his command.
It follows that the Tank Regiment Commander was not
responsible for any matters relating to the maintenance of oraer.
This means that the Tank Regiment received orders of which it had no
knowledge.
/I again﻿- 2 -
OX:..
•'i'-'..i O
:u v
I again ^11 the attention of the Regimental Coi^P^er
to this irregularity, and I objected to it once before.
The Army Regulations, Part I § 71/4 orders that if a
subordinate Commander receives any order direct from someone who is not
his immediate superior he must report it to his immediate superior.
I find that according to your report on this subject the above mentioned
instruction has not yet been put into effect in the Regiment, although
I have already once before called your attention to it. It is the duty
of the Regimental Commander to put an end to such irregularities. I do
not accept your statement that an order was given direct to subordinate
units because of urgency or because no one could be found at the
Regimental Command, -and thus it was not possible to control the order.
The Regimental Commander should have considered it important
ijX i& tiewWmy former	and if he had directed his subordinates to
abide by the regulation there would have been no need to refer to
irregularities caused by the Regimental Commander's own emissions as he
did in his report.
Your attention Is called to the necessity for being more
objective for the sake of the Service.
I therefore order you in the future to put an end to these
irregularities. Should a Commander's superior issue orders inmediately
to his‘ subordinates by reason of urgency these orders should be carried
out immediately but a report should be made to intermediate superiors.
Your attention is also called to the necessity of adhering
to the chain of command, and if this is not done in the future you will
be answerable to me.

Colonel.

COMBOS ordered us to shoot at them, saying that he had the Authority of the
English to fire at the internees if the prisoners tried to escape. We did not
shoot but COMBOS ran after them and fired about 10 shots at them with his
pistol. I did not see any of then fall to the ground and I do not know if
any of them were hit as I was unable to see.

1.	I am 28 years of age and a Hungarian. I joined the Hungarian
Army on 27th November i%4 and was transferred tc^ Belsen on 4th December 1944,
joining the 1 st Company of the Hungarian Tank Regiment.
2.	On 28th April 1945 I was on gua d duty together with Cpl Bakos
Lajos, in No 2 Camp at the corner of Pommelstrasse.	I saw approximately
8 internees appear at the opening of a 'water channel which corrects the camp
itself with a plot outside the wire. These internees must have walked along
the cha .nel, which was sufficiently deep for them to remain unseen, as I did
not notice them until they appeared at the end. I saw Lieut. COMBOS run after
these men and fire 5 shots with his pistol; one at a group of 7 men who ran
in one direction, and 4 shots at the other man who ran in a different direction.
I saw this man fall. I saw him lying there six hours later and I assume that
he was dead.
3.	Lieut COMBOS took charge of the Company, which provided the
guard, approximately 10 days after the liberation of the Camp by the British.
He ordered us to shoot at prisoners who were trying to escape and said that he
had received these orders from an English Major.
4.	I have seen Lieut COMBOS hitting internees with a rubber
truncheon, and so far as I can recollect, he struck them about 5 blows with the
truncheon. I did not see any of the internees bleeding as a result of these
blows.

POLANSKI only spoke Polish and in order to hold an official position in any
of the Camps it was necessary to know German.

1.	I am 23 years of age and a Polish Aryan. I was arrested in the simmer
of 1942 because I was a member of the Underground Movement and taken to WARSAW
prison, I was transferred to Auschwitz in February 1943 and sent to. Neuengamne
in October 1943• In December 1943 I was transferred to Hannover Factory and
came to Belsen on 7th, April 1945.
2.	On loth, July 1945 accompanied by No, 14753509 Serjeant Edward Dinsdale,
86 Special Investigation Section, Corps of Military Police, I visited Belsen
Detention Cells where I recognised a man whom 1 Icnow as ANTON POLANSKI.
3.	I first met Polanski at Auschwitz and I have known him at Neuengamme,
Hannover and Belsen. I worked with him more or less continuously in these
camps and to ny knowledge he never had any official positito except for a few
months at Hannover when he was employed as a barber.
4»	In Belsen Concentration Gamp POLANSKI lived in Block 16 and I lived
in Block 13. Block 12, inhere I am new told he was accused of being the
assistant Block leader,was administered by a Jewish Blockalteste and his
assistant, I can say of my own knowledge, was not POLANSKI — I lived in the next
block and knew the As sit ant in Block 12.
5.	I have never seen POLANSKI beat ary one. He was a kindhearted person and
whilst he was employed as a barbdr he received larger rations and would give food to
other prisoners. It is ray opinion that the persons who have identified him as
being responsible for beatings have made a mistake,	(

1,	I am 23 years of age and of Polish Nationality* I was arrested
in May 19A0 and taken to the Ghetto at Lodz. In August 1944 I was transferred
to Auschwitz and in September to Braunschweig. I was sent to Y/attenstadt in
March 1945 and I remained here for two vreeks before being sent to Ravensbruck.
I only remained at Ravensbruck for 10 days and was t'b’QJi taken to WOHBHLIN.
I arrived at Wobbelin 10 days before the liberation on 2nd. May 1945.
2.	On August 194-5, in company with Major Thoms Humphrey
Tilling, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team,
I visited Belsen Detention Cells and there recognised a man whom I know as
NATEK JOCUBOWICZ. This is the person to whom riy deposition refers,
X have known JOCUBOWICZ since I first met him at Braunschweig.
During all this time I have never seen him strike a Jewish internee. On the
contraiy it was because of his efforts that many hundreds were saved. He used
to help the others by giving them food and by protecting them against the
Russian prisoners; because of this JOCUBOWICZ was himself in danger of being
attacked by the Russians. I can state this of iry own knowledge as I was
near him at all. time and lived in Ibhe same quarters.
4.	1 knew a man by the name of FISCHER. He was an Air Raid Warden
at Lodz and he died at Ravensbruck of starvation. I would describe him as
Ginger haired and red nosed. I did not know anyone of tils name at Wobhelm.
5#	in ny opinion it was impossible for any Jewish person t& be

1*	I am 23 years of age and a Hungarian. I joined the Hungarian
Army on 4th. October 1943 and was transferred to Belsen on thelQth.December
1944, where; I joined No.7 Comparer.	*
2.	Three days after the liberation of the Carp I was on guard duty
in Camp No. 2 at the gate behind block 88. Gapt. KOVAOS came to visit the guard
and saw about 5 or 6 internees going into the woods belonging to the camp
with the intention of escaping. KOYACS ordered me to warn them to return
and if they did not obey to shoot. I accox’dinglj'- warned the internees but
they would not return and KOVACS fired at them vi th his pistol, whereupon they
ran away.. Two of these internees were wounded and I noticed thatXireir coimrades
carried them away. I am unable to say whether they died. Lance Corporal
Tibor HOB’BIAN was on guard with me at the time but he has left Belsen.
2,	Capt. KOVACS, on the day of the liberation, i.e. 15th. April 1945,
informed ’the guard that their orders were as follows;-
If the prisoner tried to run away and did not obey the first warnigg we were
to shoot. If he approached within 20 metres of the guard we were to warn him
and if he came nearer we were to shoot. If the prisoners gathered together
in a crowd and did not disperse when warned so to do we were to fife on them.
Only in this manner could we prevent their escape. He further imonned us
that we must treat everyone with the greatest sternness and take an
exairple from No.4 Company who had already shot 16 Internees. So lar as the
Russian prisoners were concerned therewas no need to warn them as the
British disliked them.﻿﻿EXHIBIT " Ul "

DEPOSITION OP MAJOR THOMAS HTIvIPRHEY TILLING, Royal AriaLIery, Legal Staff,

I have examined an arrest report form relating to the above named

which shows that he was committed to CeUe Prison on 9th, May 1945 by Captain
/
H. G. Sherrin, SO, for. Captain L. Pamer, PSO, 224 Military Government
Detachment. He is described on that form as 'CZUBIASKI Little Casinir1.
I have personally investigated his case and interrogated him on
27th. August 1945 as a result of which I am convinced that lie is not the
Capo known as 'Little Casimii1, against whom we have evidence of War Crimes, and
there is no evidence whatever against him for any crime.
It is also my opinion that lie was arrested and imprisoned owing to
mistaken identity.

j^|p;he use of ex-internees in hospital in Ho, 2 Camp. Furthermore I "believe
that a very large quantity of Aspirins existed, ^.nd was taken from this store
some little time ago for the use of other patients outside the Camp.
4.	I later discovered in the "Apotheke" in the SS Administrative Block at
Ho.l Gamp, approximately 100 wooden "boxes containing approximately 25 tins each,
and marked 'Red Cross, Hungary’; the contents were tinned milk and meat paste in
about equal quantities ,
5,	From 1.6th. April onwards I was charged with the general administrative
working in Camp Ho.l and,among other things, I took an interest in the obtaining
of water. The only source of water at tliis date was one small pump in the
women’s camp,for which the prisoners vrere almost literally fighting, and water
carts which the Arny were able to send in. Within a day or two, X canno c remember
the exact date, a HEME Major arrived charged with the task of restoring the
water supply. He and I worked together, and by using HIS -type petrol engine
pumps and the hose, all of which were available; in Ho.l Gamp, we pumped water iron
the river 300 yards away at the south end of the Camp into a tank situated
at the southern end of the Camp from which we used a further system of hoses to
supply more distant parts of the Samp. This system was in working order within
Ifi hours of our starting work on it and there was an ample supply of water
everywhere in the Camp within 5 days. Tliis was achieved with nothing more than
the facilities available to the Germans whacli were^ouna in dmp^NoSlf1’' With
the further assistance of the German local Fire 3rigad.e,we achieved within
8 days a proper water system with taps providing ample supply using the river
as a source.
6.	I further convinced that nothing but the will was lacking to enable the
supply
Germans to/water just as adequately a.s we did,
7.	A similar comment applies to the supply of latrines, of which there was an
almost entire lack in the Can® due to the fact that it was fitted with latrines
for only approximately a tenth of the numbers then accomodated in the Camp
and they were completely blocked because of this and because of the lack of
water. All that existed in the shape of latrines were one or two inadequate
pits. We started to work on this problem and found that in the more than
adequate open spaces available, and the loose sandy soil, 2 men could dig
a trench 5 ft. deep, 6 ft. long, and 2 feet wide on the hour. Although in fact
the Camp was evacuated before we had provided adequate latrine accommodation
-2-﻿^here is no reason whatsoever that I csn see why the Germans should not
have done exactly as we did and had the necessary latrines dug by prison
labour as and when numbers increased. In this connection I would add that
it was also possible to get wooden latrines made by local labour and quite a
cnnsreferable number had already been supplied up to the time that Comp ho.l
was evacuated,
8. Finally I would repeat that in all these respects, feeding, water and
sanitation, nothing whatever was lacking to enable the Germans to supply
services adequately but the will and initiative to do so. I would add in
this connection that I formed a strong impression from whatever German I
spoke to that there had never been ary serious intention to ameliorate the
appalling conditions prevailing in the Camji on its liberation .

He was a Capo in No.l Camp, at Belsen.
3.	At Belsen I lived in Block No. 2 and JUDALE1BKY was Deputy Blockleader
and .Capo of the sleeping quarters in this Block. As,I was in the Block all day
long I had anple opportunity of watching JBDiiLEWSKY. I have seen him daily
beating and ill-treating sick prisoners and a number of his victims collapsed
under the blows and had to be taken to their bunks. In my opinion these
and
beatings helped, to shorten the lives of the half-starved/sick people.
4.	I remember one particular occasion after the morning Appel when
JITOALEWSKY-i entered the block and found a sick man in his bunk. He then
proceeded to beat this man with a wooden board and the sick man jumped down from
his bed., JUDALEWHKY then continued to beat him. I left the hut whilst the
beating was in progress but after a while I was called back to collect a
dead corpse from the floor. I had to carry the body to the shed near Block
2 where the dead were collected. I am convinced that this was the body of the
sick man as the hut had been cleared of all the dead people shortly before
JBDALESSKY entered the quarters. Ihen I returned to the quarters this was
the only corpse there,

were sick and'weak through huriger. Many of these beatings occurred on parades,
such as the distribution of food .
I remember one occasion , whilst we were standing on Appel, when I sav
JUMLEWSKY getting the prisoners of the adjoining Block No.2 on Appel.
*
He was beating a prisoner with his belt, staking him across the face and body,
until eventually the man fell to the ground screaming. He was then carried
by his comrades to the first row of the assembled parade, where he was put down
on the ground and remained sitting through the whole of the parade because he
was unable to stand up.
^	When I vreis moved into Block No.2 I did not attend the morning Appels.
However I often saw JUDALEWSKY beating the prisoners at the daily distribution
of food. On these occasions he would either use a stick or wooden board and
the beatings were so serious that many of those whom he beat were bleeding and.
were unable to work.
-1-﻿'	5«	I was present on 13th. April 1945 when JTIDAIEISKI came to
- ‘	Slt>cK 2	fit
/•'^JPollect sick people from the Typhus Blocks Ho. 5 and. 7. These men were all
A
very sick and. some of them were unable to get out of their beds. JID-ALEWSKY
beat these people with his belt and chased them round as if they were animals.
1 am of the opinion that may of these men died shortly afterwards as a result
of these beatings.

PEPOSITION OF JOSZEI1' SILBERSTEIN (male) late of 6 Str. Cloaka, Targu Mures,
Rumania, sworn before Major Thoms Humphrey Tilling, Royal Airtillery, Legal
Staff, Ko,l War Crimes Investigation Team#
1.	I am 13 years of age and a Rumanian. I was arrested in May 1914
and put in prison. After three weeks I was transferred to Auschwitz where I
remained until the beginning of July 1944 and was then sent to Buchenwald.
I only remained at this camp for a few days arid I was then moved to two cantos
near Leipzig, first to Seitz and then to Bergoelster. I was then transferred
back to Buehenwald in November 1944 and arrived at Belsen on 21st. January 1945.
2.	On 22nd. August 1945, in company with Lieutenant H.H. Alexander,
Pioneer Corps, 21 Army Group Interpreters Pool, attached to No.l War Grimes
Investigation Teajn, I visited Belsen Detention Cells and. there recognised a man
■f''
whom I knew as ISAAK. I am now told that his full name is ISAAK JUDALEW3KY.
He was a Capo in No.l Gamp at Belsen,
3.	I lived in the- same Block as JITOALEISKY at Belsen, this was Block
No. 2, and he was the Deputy Blockleader and Capo of the sleeping quarters. He
pretended not to be a Jew and Y/as extremely brutal in his treatment of the Jewish
prisoners. I have seen him beating sick and half starved prisoners with the
buckle part of Iris belt or a vrooden board taken from the bed itself.
These beatings were so serious that in my opinion they must have caused numerous
deaths.
Sfefore and after morning Appel he would go round the sleeping
quarters and beat the sick people who werelying in their bunks unable to get up.
He would beat them with the buckle part of his belt and whilst beating them
he would drag them to the floor and continue to beat them. In many oases
I have seen them left in an unconscious state on the f Ichor. The hut order His
Y/ould pick up the victims and put them back on the bed. Some days, when an
internee doctor was present, he would examine the victims and, if still living,
would put them back into their bunks or, if dead, have their bodies removed,
4.	I remember an occasion when I was present at the beating of one
of these prisoners which caused Ms death. About the middle of larch I saw
-1-﻿JUDiSBsteKy enter the sleeping quarters and he went to a sick prisoner on the
top bunk. He struck him two violent blows with the buckle part of his belt-
on the mouth and face and the prisoner lept down from the bed and collapsed
unconscious on the floor. JUDALEWSKY continued to beat him with the belt
for about lj3 minutes and also kicked him ?/ith his boots. After lie had left the room,
I and several of rrry comrades went to fetch the internee doctor, Dr. Konig, who has
since died of typhus, and after examining the man he told us the man was dead.

in Hungary. I arrived at Belsen in January 1945.
2.	On 24th. August 1945 I visited Belsen Detention Cells in company
with Lieutenant H.H. Alexander, Pioneer Corns, 21 Amy Group Interpreters Pool,
attached to No.l War Crimes Investigation Team, and there recognised a woman whom
I knew as "MBHUSCHA"; she was the hut orderly in Block Nos. 204 and 216 in the
Womans part of No.l Carp at Belsen. I am now told that her name is MANIA
MALZYNEN.
3.	I lived in Block Nos. 38, 204 and 216 at Belsen. I have seen
MALZYNER beating and ill-treating sick prisoners almost every day. She would beat
than with her fists or a rubber truncheon until they fell to the gpound, she
would then proceed to kick them with her boots. Owing to their sick and weak
condition I am of the opinion that many of them would not be able to survive
such brutal treatment. On many occasions MALZ2NER would call the roll at
3 o’clock in the morning and those who were unable to get up would be forcibly
thrown out of their bunks and severely beaten; they would then be made to crawl
to the parade ground in front of the block. After the parade these girls would
be too weak to return to the block and it was ny duty as a member of the
"Leichenkommando"(working party for moving corpses) to collect them and carry them
back to the block. They would be left in the passage together with the other
dying people and would live for a day or so. X have myself carried many corpses
to the mortuary and in my opinion a number of their deaths were caused through
the brutality and beatings administered by MAL2YNER.
4.	When we told ITTAZYNBR that after the liberation by the British she
would have to pay for these murders, she replied *That does not frighten me,
by
because	then all of you will be finished off*.

prisoners by beating them in a very brutal manner. She did this inorder to force
them to do duties which they would normally have been unable to perform owing to
their state of health and as a result many of the sick and weak girls died within a

April 1945, I think about 11th. April, the following incident occurred.
A colleague of mine in the 'Ssskommando* named Margit Bicker, was ordered
by MALZYNER to fetch the food from the kitchen. This ^Lrl was already ill with
typhus and could hardly move from her bunk and 1IALZYNER, in order to make her get up,
started to beat her with, her fists and w ith a whip, mainly upon Hie head and across the

girls and the severity of the beatings I am of the opinion that the beatingb were
sufficient to cause a deterioration of their state of health to such a degree as to
lead to their death within a few days and in some cases, in a matter of hours.

a sick wbman of about 35 years of age, to leave the sleeping quarters 01 the clock and
move into the 'passage where all the typhus-ridden girls lay. The woman realising
that this meant certain death through beihg contaminated by them, refused to go.
I then saw MALZXNER. ooramence to beat her with a large wooden stick across the head and
all over the body. As a result of the beatings the woman fell to the ground and
MALZIHER then started to kick her. with her nailed boots until a girl by the name of

2.	I recognize No. 3 on photograph 2/4/2 as a CaP° at Auschwitz.
I knew her by the name of HILDE LOHBAUER arid “I have now brim told that that is
her correct name. She was in Berkenau Camp which is "actually the womens' camp
at Auschwitz. Surrounding this camp was an electrified wire. Just inside
the wire was a ditch, about three metres wide; I do not know its depth.
One morning about the middle of August 1942, I think it was about S.a.m., I
was one of a party of about 60 women office workers who were assembled near this
ditch before marching out to Auschwitz Camp. While standing there I saw
about 15 or 20 women in this ditch struggling in the water.	On the bank of
the ditch stood LOHBAUER. She was holding a pole so that those in the water
could just grasp it. * When one of the women did manage to get hold of the
pole LOHBAUER would half pull her out and then with a downward thrust of the
pole she would push the woman back into tire water. I saw her doing -cm
various women during the ten minutes that I was standing there. I was then

DEPOSITION OP MABGIT GROSS BERG (Female) late of 8, Oberrauhle, Kasmark,
Slovakia, sworn Before Captain ALEXANDER MACKENLAY FORBES, Royal Artillery,
Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
I am 29 years of age and. Because I am a Jewess, I was
arrested on 2?th March 1942 and taken to Poprad prison where I remained until
Being transferred to Auschwitz on 3^ April 1942. After passing through various
Camps I was transferred to Belsen on 26th February 1945.
2.	I recognize No. 3 on photograph VV2 as a Capo at
Auschwitz. I knew her by the name of HILDE LOHBAUER and I have now Been
told that that is her correct name. I was in Berkenau, which is the womens
part of Auschwitz Camp, and LOHBAUER was a Capo at Berkenau. I remember an
occasion at about 5.a.m. on a day at the beginning of August 1942 when I was
being marched, with others, to the offices where we worked. These offices
were in Auschwitz and we had to march from Berkenau to Auschwitz. Near the
exit from Berkenau was a ditch about 3 metres wide and over 2 metres deep.
The sides were sloping.	This ditch was surrounded by electrified wire. The
ditch was full of water. As we' approached this ditch I saw about 10 or 12
women, whom I later heard were Dutch, struggling in the water. I also saw
the hands, bellies and heads of other people just above the water. On the
bank of the ditch LOHBAUER, other female Capos and two or three S.S. men were
standing. I do not know any of their names apart from LOHBAUER. The
other Capos and LOHBAUER were holding long wooden sticks so that the women
in the water could just grasp them. Once the poles were held by the women,
the Capos (including LOHBAUER) would half pull them from the water and then
with a violent thrust of the stick push them back again and hit the women
with the sticks as they struggles in the water. I then left to go to work.
On returning that evening I saw that the ditch was clear but I saw about
30 bodies lying on the banks. I was later told by the Blockalteste of No.22,
whose name is BERTHEL STEINHAUSER that all the women who had been in the
ditch had perished. I do not know where BERTHEL STEINHAUSER is now.

Investigation Team.
I am 2f2 years of age and, because I am a Jew, I was arrested
in Budapest by the Police on 20th March 1944 and there put in prison. On 29th
April 1944 I was sent to Auschwitz and after passing through various Camps I
arrived at Belsen on 5th April 1945.
2.	On 4th July 1945, accompanied by No. 15041777 Serjeant
ERIC GEORGE STANLEY, Pioneer Corps, 21st .Army Group Interpreters Pool, I
visited Belsen Detention Cells where I identified a man as ANTON POLANSKI
whom I first met at Belsen. He was Assistant Block Leader of Block 12,
Camp 1, Belsen Concentration Camp. I lived in this block.
5>	At 3.a.m. on 9th April 1945, the day after try arrival at
Belsen, all prisoners living in Block 12, including myself, were called out
to«carry dead bodied. Standing a”t the door of the block were 8 or 9 men
amongst whom was POLANSKI. As we came through the door we were beaten by
these men. They used rubber truncheons, leather belts and sticks and knocked
many of the people to the ground. People were falling on top of each other
in their endeavours to avoid the beating.
]+'	on 15th April 1945 I was working with PAVEL BURGER, MENDEL
PUGHS and SANDOR ENGEL . We were carrying dead bodies. With us was a Pole
named JACOBOVITSCH who was extremely weak from hunger and could not carry on
working. He sat down and POLANSKI saw him. He started to beat JACOBOVITSCH
with a wooden club. We had to carry on working and onretuming a short tune
later found JACOBOVITSCH dead at the same place where we had left him being
beaten by POLANSKI. We carried JACOBOVITSCH* s body to the big ‘death pit*
and dropped it in.

2.	-	I was on guard duty three days after the li eration of the Camgi
by the ^ritish on 15th April 1945 and my post was at B.B2 in Camp No 2.
I saw three internees collecting turnip peelings from a spot near to where I
v/as on guard. The./ then moved off in the direction of the swimming pool
where COMBOS Was standing. He shouted at them and 1 saw him fire at them
with his pistol and hit one of the internees ir the leg; his trousers were
covered with blood. The other two internees picked him'up and asked me There
his round could be dressed; I told them that the 4th building was a British
Hospital. They started off in that direction but were stopped by COMBOS,
who asked them Where they were going. They replied that they were going to .
the hospital and he ordered them to return to the lock which ’they refused to
do. He took out his pistol and ordered them once more to return to their
block. This they did. I do not know what became of the injured man. I
think he was either a Russian or a Pole.

2.	I first met MARIA MALZYNER in Block 216 in BELSBK, where she was employed as
hut orderly in a room of 200 prisoners, among them myself. I knew her by the name of
MAKISCHA, but have now been tola her name is MARIA MALZYHER.
Her job was to keep the room clean, to distribute food and water, and to get us out
on Appel. She was in no position to punish us severely, as she was not a Kapo and
which we were living.
® More food meant survival, and knowing this, every prisoftr was out to find means to
get a bigger ration. The most common way was to steal one's fellow-prisoners' food. One
would do this even with one's best friend, not to spealc of the sick who were unable to
defend themselves. If a prisoner got caught, or was denounced for having done so,
MALZYHHR had to punish the offender.
There were only about 25 Polish girls in that Block, and .the remainder were
Hungarians. It is a fact that the Hungarians did not like the poles.

As hut orderly she had to care for the cleanliness of the block, distribute the food,
and to make the prisoners go on Appel, She did not wield any authority, and, although
she sometimes had to punish us, because of offences against fellow-prisoners, by
ipping us with her hand, she could not possibly have gone so far as to use a rubber
truncheon or a whip. We would have revolted against such brutal treatment by a
prisoner with practically no power at all.
As for good deeds done to prisoners by MARIA MAEZIHER, I only want to mention that
when I was sick she brought me coffee, and at night came to ny bunk to look after me.

^the job, she had to be very strict, I have often seen her . oing around and shouting
orders, but I have never seen her beating a girl. On the contrary,she was kind and
helpful towards girls whom she had known in other camps, and would give them
sometimes, more soup than they were entitled to.

As hut orderly she was not a Kapo, and not allowed to beat anybody, ^s a matter of

her own share of soup to sick Hungarian girls, because she could get food from the

I lived. The great majority of its inhabitants were Hungarian girls, and only about
20 to 25 Polish girls. It was sometimes difficult to keep the living-quai'ters clean,
and to make the girls have a wash. Everybody’s main concern was to get as much food
as possible. Everybody complained about getting too little food. There were often rows
between the internees. llalzyner tried to keep order as best" she could, by persuasion,
or by threatening the person concerned to report her to the blockleader, but I have
never seen her beat anyone. She would care for the sick, get coffee for them and
fetch flour and potatoes from the kichen to prepare special*food for the sick, in

-It I was arrested'in August 19^ and taken to RADOK G/J.P, where I stayed \mtil
May 1943 when I was transferred to BLIZY1J Lahoui’ Carp. I v/as sent to AUSCHV/ITZ in
August 1944 and after two days there, went to HIMDEHBIIRG Labour Gamp. I spent five
months at HINDENBIIRC- Labour Canp, and was then transferred to NOHDil/dJSM. I arrived
at BSLSEN in January 1945*
{
2. I first met MARIA MAL2mEK in Block 216 in BELSEll, where she v/as employed as
hut orderly in a room of 200 prisoners, among them nyself. I knew her by the name
of MARISCHA. I have now been told that her name is MARIA I-ALZYIISR.
Her job was to keep the room clean, to distribute the soup, and to make the
prisoners go on parades. As hut orderly,her power was insignificant compared ?d.th
^^that of a Kapo, the blockleader, to whom she was directly responsible. Every one
^fof the prisoners would have liked, and tried hard to get a job of this sort, as it
meant extra food, and extra food meant survival. It was only natural, because of this
• vital reason, that 1/L4LZYNER wanted to keep her position. If she failed in her duties,
she would get punished by the blockleader or the S3. As a matter of fact, I have often
seen her being beaten by inspecting 33 women, who oonplained of untidiness in the
□lock. On the other hand, HALZYHSR could not very well enforce her orders or punish
prisoners by beating them in a cruel way. Her job as hut orderly lacked authority,
and severe beatings on her part would have met with retaliation on behalf of the
victim. Thus her task was not an easy one.
However, under the prevailing appalling conditions, there were occasions when she
was compelled to punish prisoners. Ijs happened more than once, that in the struggle
for more food, the healthier internees would manage to get two portions of soup,°taking
the portion of a sick internee who was not able to fight for her share. Thi§ would
be seen and reported to MALZTNER, and, in order to stop the habit, she had to mmish

Other occasions when trouble arose, were the daily, morning Appels. The
very sick were exempt from these parades, and in order	standing for hours
in the cold, many healthy internees would pretend to be -ene-eijiie sick, and mix with
them. When found, they had to be punished, because for every shirker left inside,
a sick internee had to go on parade. I nyself was slapped by IvIALZYlIER for doing
this.

2.	In Belsen I lived in Block 204 and 216. In both Tjlocks I.aria llalzyner was
employed as hut orderly, first in 204 and later in 216. In this capacity she had
to distribute the food, and to watch the cleanliness of the sleeping-quarters. She
had absolutely no right to beat the prisoner£,as she was not a Kapo in the true
sense or the word. As a matter of fact, I have never seen her beating a girl. Her
orders, shouted in a loud voice, were sufficient to make the girls do what she
wanted. I must however, admit that her task was not an easy one, owing to the fact
that most of the girls were of Hungarian nationality, and she was a Pole. There was
always a feeling of animosity between the Polish and Hungarian sectors of the block.

Liy dutios consist of assisting
2.
ul burials and supervising a«t the 0eroetary.
3.	The Gemetery also serves the	area, and about the beginning of 1945,
the first burial of a a'isoner from JiASKL Ganp took place at BSiJiSTEDT. Erom
then onwards,until the incident rnentioned hereafter, single bodies were brought
in from the gamp fresa time to time, and they were all buried in the Cenetary. I
think there were iibout 20 bodies brought in over this period.
4.	On the first five or six occasions that these bodies were brought in, they
were carried on a proper rootor hearse, but subsequently they vrere brought in on
a type of farm cart. Coffins wore not ppovidod owing; to the shortage of wood,
but the bodies were wrapped in paper shrouds. HTLLIiP HBIISL, who held a
position at the Canp, usuolly attended tlie ljurials.
5.	About the end of April 1945, I cannot remember the exact elate, but; I know it
was shortly before the British arrived, in the area, 1 received a message from the
Church authorities telling'me'that ItElSKL had informed, them that he had a number
of bodies, I think it was twelve, for burial, I went to the Ceiaetary and 1
found there a number ef women prisoners from JiAS'SL Cam.) digging the grave. The
grave was being dug in a plot alongside the place where the previous SASSL
prisoners had been buried.
6.	I spoke to one of the women and I asked her why there were such a large
number- of bodies,and she told m that they were the bodies of women who were
passing through the Oamo,«nd that they had died from starvation. JThis prisoner
also told me that she had been told by other girls,who had. survived the .journey,
that the Journey had been a long one and that they had nothing to eat or drink*
I do not remember the names of any laces being mentioned. The prisoner did
not say whether the women load died before or after arrival at the Camp,	t
7.	I subsequently saw the bodies in the mortuary, I cannot reneiaber the exact
number, but I think there were between nine and twelve. The bodies were naked
and not in shrouds as on previous occasions, I was thus able to see their
condition. The prisoners appeared to have been dead for two or three days and
there was no deco; position. The bodies were just akin and bone and I could quite
understand that these prisoners had died of starvation. I did not see ary signs
of gun-shot wounds,or ary signs of ary ill-treatment.
8.	HJMMEL came to the Geraetaiy for the burial, and I asked him why the bodies
were not in shrouds 's on previous occasions. He informed me that they .had not got
ary at the Camp, and in ary event, as the prisoners had not beer, suffering from
any infectious disease, it didvnot ratter if the,, wore buried naked. I identify
taibe. 46 on the ghotoja k . :.y 2 as HilLIH HEIOSL.
9# The burial took place without ary service. Tire bodies were laid alongside
each other in the grave which had been dug by the women from the Camp, I would
mention that the part of the Cemetery in which the bodies are buried, is also
used for the burial of German citizens of no means.
10. I did not report this matter to the British authorities, as ©arly in llay I

I am at present living at: Belsen, Camp 2, Block GB 6 (Polish Committee)
1.	I was arrested on the 10th November 1942 in WARSAW by the
GESTAPO for being a member of the Polish Underground Movement, and was
taken to a prison at WARSAW. I was transferred to MAJDANEK Concentration
Camp on 1?th January 1943* On the 8th June 1943 I was returned to the
prison at WARSAW, was subsequently transferred to GROSS ROSEN Concentration
Camp, and after a few days went to HALBAU Labour Camp, in July 1944.
I was transferred from HALBAU to BELSEN on the 12th February 1945 and arrived
at BELSEN on the 12th March 1945*
2.	I have been shown a photograph marked "2/4/3" and I recognise
No 5 thereon as being a German prisoner named Stanislaus KACZYSKA, whom I
first met in HALBAU Labour Camp and later at BELSEN.
3.	At HALBAU Labour Camp I worked first in the nearby Aircraft
Factory and later in the Camp Office as a so-called "Arbeitsdienst", ray job
consisting of compiling the daily parade state of the allocations of prisoners
working in the factory.
4*	KACZYSKA was "Lagerfiltester" at HALBAU Labour Camp. I state
that he was responsible for beating prisoners, for many acts of brutal
punishment, and for deliberately handing prisoners over to the SS personnel
for extermination.
5.	I have veiy often seen him beat prisoners. He would grip the
prisoner by that part of his jacket under the chin with his right hand,
hitting, at the same time, with his elbow right into the man's face. The
prisoner, not expecting the blow, would fall to the ground, whereupon
KACZYSKA would kick the prisoner with his jackboots on the legs and all over
the body. He used to punish prisoners vtoo were reported to him as having
been la^y at the factory by beating than across the face and shoulddrs with
a long wooden ladle which was especially sent for from the cookhouse.
With the words "Go and fetch Josef from the cookhouse" KACZYSKA would order
a prisoner to go and get the ladle (which he celled "Josef") and would then
inflict the punishment on him. These beatings lasted from one to five
minutes.
6.	KACZYSKA liked and enjoyed sadistic forms of punishment. I
remember as occasion in the winter of 1944/45 when we were made to parade
one morning in the court of the Camp in orddr to be present at the punishment
of a prisoner. The night before, this prisoner, who was about 20 years of
age, named SKALIK if I sun not mistaken, and who was known to be a mentally
deranged person, was caught whilst leaving the Block. The BlockSlteste
reported him to KACZYSKA who ordered the aforesaid parade to be held. I am
convinced that KACZYSKA was solely responsible for the form of the punishment
described hereinafter, be cause he was present at this parade and in fact
acted as commander of the procedure; he gave instructions as to how to
deal with the prisoner, taking obviously great pleasure at his suffering,
and jeering at him. The prisoner was stripped of his jacket and trousers
and appeared in front of us attired only in his shirt and underpants.
A headgear made of paper was put on his head and a large paper collar was
fixed round his neck. He was then made to run in this attire in wide circles
in front of us for about fifteen to twenty minutes. After that, two
Ukranian SS Guards, one of whom was an Unterscharfuhrer, the other an SS Mann,
whose names I do not now remember, got hold of the prisoner and pushed him
in the direction of the Camp exit, inducing him to run. As the distance
was too great, I was unable to see what happened afterwards. I only heard
a shot and shortly afterwards a body covered with a blanket was brought back.
We never saw this prisoner again.
-1-﻿%u
tjehi
Another ptmislment which I have seen KACZY3KA. inflicting on
»i as oners more than once was the following. He would tie a prisoner's hands
oehind his back, and then hang him up off the ground by his hands, fro® a
beam of a wooden hut, in which these hangings took place. I remember an
occasion which occurred during the same winter as the events related in
paragraph 6 above. A group of four prisoners had been accused of attempting
to escape. One of these prisoners cited me as a witness that he had been
at the morning parade. In connection with this I was called to the office
of the Lager-Kommandant and to go there I had to cross the hut where these
hangings were inflicted by KACZYSKA. On crossing the hut, I saw a prisoner,
whom I knew by the name of LUTSCHM, and who was a professional boxer, hanging
by his hands from a beam of the hut, as described above. KACZYSKA was
standing next to the prisoner and hitting him on his feet, which were hanging
above the ground, with a wooden club, apparently with the purpose of making
him confess. Later I was told by one of those prisoners who were questioned
in the same way, but without being beaten, that LUTSCHAK was left hanging
for about an hour and was beaten by KACZYSKA until he became unconscious.
Later these prisoners were put into solitary confinement in a bunker.
Besides this case, I have seen with ny own eyes about six or
seven prisoners being punfehed in the same way by KACZYSKA during my stay at
HALBAU Labour Gang).
8.	We left HALBAU Labour Camp for BELSEN on the 12th February 1945,
and were made to march a distance of about 30° ^“s. , which took via about three
weeks. Tte luggage and other belongings of the SS personnel were taken along
in farm carts, but instead of horses we were made to pull these carts all the
way, using the following device: two long ropes, one for each side of the
cart were fixed at the front. These were connected at certain intervals
with a number of thick wooden sticks, the intervals being large enough to
leave space for four prisoners, one marching alongside the other. By pushing
against the stick with the chest, by the connected rope the cart was moved.
After a fews days marching with insufficient food more and more prisoners
were unable to carry on pulling these carts and dropped out. They were taken to
the last cart of our column by S3 Guards and Kapos and travelled on this car-t
a certain distance until Oberscharfuhrer MATTHIAS HESSHAUS, who was in command
of our party, gave the signal to get the prisoners off the cart. They were
then led to sandpits on the roadside and shot,by HESSHAUS and the Ukranian
Guards with automatic pistols. During the march KACZYSKA was going alongside
the prisoners, watching them closely, and if he saw anybody who appeared
tired and not able to cany on for long, he would point at him, order him to
fall out and take him to the last cart. I have seen all this myself. As
a matter of fact nothing during this march was more dreaded than the appearance
of KACZYSKA. Whenever he moved up along our cart we would try to suppor
the weak and tired comrades lest tte should order them to be taken to the
death cart. When we set out from HALBAU Labour Camp ^	.^OO
men. On arrival at BELSEN a month later we were only 600 to 700, 200 to 30U
had been shot during the march.
I met KACZYSKA again at BELSEN where he became REVTER-KAPO
only for a few days shortly before the liberation. He then fell sick* 1
myself was at that time siok with Typhus at the hnapltal. I remember how he
came tr ny	one day and, being in a confidential mood, said to me You^
can’t get through ConOentration Camps without killing at least two people .

September 1945 I endeavoured to trace the whereabouts of a witness named
FRANEK, who was Block Leader in Block No 2 at Mens* Camp No 1, Belsen, and
1*10 was called for by ISAAK JODALEWSKI to speak in his defence.
2*	I am informed by former inmates of Block No 2 that FRANEK is a
Yugoslav, and has returned to Yugoslavia.
3*	I am unable to find any trace of his surname, and as there is no
longer a Yugoslavian Comnittee in Belsen Camp no further trace could be
found of the said FRANEK.

2,	I nave been shown a photograph marked "2/3/3$* and I recognise
the second woman from the left thereon as being an S3 Woman whom I know
from AUSCHWITZ. I am now told that her name is GERTRUD RUNHGLD.
3.	At AUSCHWITZ I lived in BIRKENAU (Auschwitz II) in the Womens’
Camp ’O’, in Blocks 20 , 22 and 29. REINHQLD was an Aufseherin in the Gang).
She used to be present at the daily morning and evening roll-calls, and
supervised various working parties in the Camp. She carried a rubber
truncheon and it was a daily occurrence that she beat girls because they
were not lined up properly on parade, did not move fast enough, or for
similar reasons. I was not personally beaten by her.
once I was employed in carrying bricks from the Station at
AUSCHWITZ to a building site in the Camp. I was in a Kommando of about
25 girls and had to walk, loaded with bricks, a distance of about one
Kilometre. REINHCSjD was one of the Aufseherinnen of this Kommando and
she compelled us to carry more bricks than we were able, making us move
very fast. If she saw a girl slowing down her pace she would come up to
her and beat her savagely with the rubber-truncheon on the face and across
the shoulders. I have seen many of the girls bleeding from the nose
as a result of such beatings. I do not remember the name of any of the
people concerned.	r

5.	Very often REINHC!LD would make selections for the Gas Chamber
of her own accord* i.e., she would order a special parade, usually held at
2 o'clock in the afternoon, in front of the Block. When the girls had
lined up, she would choose the weak and sick-looking ones and order, them
to step aside. She would then take their number and name; after the
parade they would be marched away. It was common knowledge amongst us
prisoners that these girls were taken to the Gas Chamber. I never saw

put in this "Strafkoramando" for a short time, because I was caught cooking potatoes
during the lunch break.
On many occasions I have seen SEYFARTH beating prisoners with a big wooden

1.	I knew SOFIA SEYFARTH at AUSOHWITZ-BIRKSNAn by the name of “SASCHA".
I first met her during the winter 1943/44 in various Aussenkommandos in whi<^
she was a Kapo. Her treatoent of the prisoners was ruthless and brutal, and
as a result she was appointed Oberkapo in the notorious Strafkomnando (Punishment
Group). I was sent to this Strafkomraanao for a minor offence, and found
that we had to work very hard, digging trenches in the mud and loading tubs*
We were standing knee deep in water, and had to load six large tubs in three
hours. SE2FARTH used to watch us, and would pick out anyone who failed to
finish her task in the appointed time and did not bribe her with food or
cigarettes. SEYFARTH would beat her victims with a wooden club or stout
stick across the back and shoulders, or strike them in the face with the flat
of her hand, often so hard as to knock the victim down to the ground.
2*	On one occasion when we came back froa work, the Strafkonmando was
made to parade in the court; we had to kneel with our hands raised from
6 p.nu till 4 aum. I was unable to stand this treatment, and got permission
from the Block Leader to stay in the Block next morning instead of going
out to work. Next morning SEYFARTH came to fetch me, and had an argument
with the Block Leader, whom she ordered to send me at onoe to the wording
site, saying that I was merely too lazy to do my job. Next day I had,to
report sick and was admitted to the Hospital.
3	I have not witnessed a single good deed of hers, nor do I know
of any facts which could be explained in such a way as to serve in her
defence. I have been shown a photograph mahked 2/5/1 and I recognise No 26

saw KACZYSKA; he walked around with a thick wooden stick. I remember an incid-
ent that occurred in the very first hours after our arrival. Amongst us
prisoners was the Chief of the Fire Brigade of my home town,.whose name I do
not know, and who was still dressed in his uniform. For one reason or another,
I think because KACZYSKA believed this prisoner to be one of the most prominent
in our transport whom he intended to humiliate, he singled him out and without
any apparent reason started to beat him most violently with his stick across
the face and body. This beating lasted quite some time; the prisoner did not
bleed, but when KAOZYSKA finailly let him off, he was hardly able to stand up.

KACZYSKA was "Blookftltester" of this Block. I remember the following incident
which I saw hagaaing. One morning in March or April 1944 two Polish prisoners,
whose names I do not know, one about 40, the other about 30 years of age, were
crossing the day room of the Block, in a partition of which KACZYSKA was asleep
on his bed. These two men were wearing cloga. and through the noise of their

steps KACZYSKA was awakened. Mad with anger, he got up, came naming
to the two men and had them knocked down in a very short time, using
his hare hands and fists with which he gave them a few quick and sharp
blows on the face and under the chin. While the men Were lying on
the floor KACZYSKA. started to trample upon <them with his jackboots,
sparing neither face or body of his victims. This lasted for a good
few minutes after which he returned to his bunk. I saw the-- prisoners
lying on the floor with blood coming from nose and mouth. They were
then put aside and covered with blankets by other prisoners. In the
evening, four prisoners came and carried the bodies avray.	I am sure
they were dead, because when the four men came hack without the bodies,
I asked one of the prisoners where they had left than and he replied
"We have taken them to the crematorium"

SUMMARY of EXAMINATION of
Wladialaw BYRSKI (Male) of HOBOT-PONIKIEW,
Poland
duly sworn states:
I am 33 years of age, of Polish nationality, horn at HOBOT-PGNIKIEW, Poland.
My permanent home is at HOBOT-PGNIKISW, Poland. I am at present living at
BSLSHN, Camp No 2, Kitchen 18.
1,	I was arrested in October 1942 in BISLITZ by. the OESTAPO
for being a member of the Polish Underground Movement, and taken to prison
at BIELITZ. I was transferred to AUSCHWITZ in January 1943, to MISLOWITZ
Labour Caap in July 1943, to GROSS ROSEN Concentration Camp in January 1944,
to ttat.-ratt Labour Camp in July 1944, and from HALBAU to BELSSN on 12th
February 1945. I arrived at BELSEN on 12th March 1945*
2.	I have been shown a photograph marked "2/5/10/ and I recognise
No 40 thereon as an S3-man whom I first met at BELSEM Concentration Camp.
I did not know him by his name, and I have now been told that his name is
KARL SCHMITT.
j.	At BELSEN I lived in Block 15 in the Mens’ Camp No 1. This
Block, which housed about 1500 to 2000 people, was an annexe to the REVTER
and was called "SCHONUNGSBLOCK", which means "Block for Convalescent People".
Actually, it was used for very sick prisoners who were unable to work and
who could not be housed at the REVEIR proper because of lack of space.
In this Block I was employed, together with 8 to 10 other prisoners, as a
Hut Orderly. Karl SCHMITT was the Blockftihrer of this Block. He was
an S.D.G. (SanitStsdienstgrad, a sort of Medical Orderly). As Blockfdhrer
SCHMITT had to take the morning Appel, which lasted from about 3 o’clock
until 11 o’clock. The Hut Orderlies were ordered by SCHMITT to clear the
Block of prisoners and to line them up on the Appel-Ground in front of the
Block. Only the very sick were left inside. Under the then prevailing
conditions at BELSEN, and considering that most of the prisoners were sick
and underfed people, it was an almost impossible task. SCHMITT’S instruc-
tions to us were of the sort that we should kill people if need be to get
them out of the Block, or to obtain order in the ranks on the Appel-Ground.
For this purpose he had issued us with thick wooden clubs which we were
instructed to vise against the sick prisoners, and he threatened to deprive
us of food if we did not act accordingly. I never did so, but two other
Hut Orderlies, named JOSEF MAGIERA and ADOLF GUTMAN (who is now in Prison
for theft) acted according to these instructions, and I have seen them
finishing off many prisoners. Attached hereto and marked "W.B. 1" is
a photograph of these two Hut Orderlies, JOSEF MAGEERA being marked with
the figure "1" just above the head, and ADOLF GUTMAN being marked with
the figure "2" just above the head.
4.	SCHMITT himself was present at the morning ^ppel. If the
prisoners did not get out of the Blobk quickly enough, he would enter the
Block, ask a prisoner to go and get him a shovel and then, taking the
shovel, he would start to beat the sick who were just around him or who
just happened to have come across his way with the iron part of the shovel.
He beat indiscriminately, on all parts of the body, whatever part of a man’s
body was just at his aim’s length. The prisoners around him tried to
run away to escape the blows, those being hit fell to the ground, they were
kicked by SCHMITT and trampled upon by the crowd of prisoners who wanted
to get away and thus killed and left lying on the ground. I knew that
they were killed because the Leiohenkommando came to fetch them later and
I have never seen than again. Scenes like the one described above I have
witnessed four times.

more bodies for burial in the future, and that I should arrange to set aside piece
of ground in the Cemetery where the prisoners could be buried. I ob^eotod tof this
proposition, and I had all the prisoners buried in a part of the Cemetery which is
also used fa’ the burial of ‘erman citizens.
4* For the first far burials tiie
aut!iorities arraigned wirr t!» local under-
taker to provide coffins and also a hearse, but subsequently the bodies were brought
in on a farm cart, then the bodies were not in coffins but in type of linen shroud.
5. Prom October 1944 until 22n'i \pril 1945, there v.ere 22 burials of prisoners free
YAoKL ceiap. The '..rials were carried out without any service or cereraoiy. If a
religous service had been requested, the pastor at 3A3Hj would have beer the one who
should have attended, but as •; .is was not requested he did not do so.
6. On 22nd April 1945, I wan told by II lET 1..K IT :	vfao works in iho i^storat

'large number of graves, and ths Camp authorities accordingly had arrangod for a party
of prisoners to attend and dig the graves. Slfli fiJ also told me that he had not
received the proper authority for the burial.
7. I accordingly telephoned to IMJRKGAM®, which was the Headquarters of all the
Concentration Canos in the Hamburg area, and aolse 1 that trr burial certificates ce
supplied. I was informed that the oertifioa.t';s could not be su: lied as no details
were known about the prison ?ra, who won: only in transit throtj^f .Y-3 2 Carn. I did
not ask how, when or where the prisoners had died.
8. In the circumstances I had no altexvative but to obey the orders of the Cam

attend the burial to obtain all the particulars possible. SIS3BK5 had also informed
me that the bodies were naked and I told him • o arrange for supplies df straw vo
line the graves, and else'for some material to cover the bodies.
S. The burial took glace on the 23rd April 1945. consequently SIY-1”?L informed

Summary of examination-of KAZBOlERZ &LAZEW5KI, carpenter of
PRZEMYSLOV/A 2, WARSAW, PQLANB, duly sworn states:••
I am 34 yeqrs of age of Polish nationality, born at WARSAW. My permanent
home is at PRZEMYSLOWA 2, WARSAW, aforesaid. I am at present.living at
Block 85, Room 29, HOME (BELSM) CAMP, SERMANY.	.
„	' '	• 't'	'1 - ■ ’	■.	•
2.	On the 12th August 1940 I was living in WARSAW, and on that day there
were wholesale arrests, by, the Germans, of all male Poles living in ay district.
I, was amongst those arrested, and on the 15th August 1940 I was sent to
AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp where I remained for 4 years and 14 days. On the
29th August 1944 I was sent to RAVENSBRUK Concentration Camp. I was there 9 days
and was then sent to SWEMMUNDKN Camp, where I remained until 9th April 1945
when I was sent to B3LSEN.
3.	During my imprisonment at AUSCHWITZ, I was working as a carpenter. I was
in a Hbmmando of about 50 carpenters, and we were usually sent out to work in
factories in the vicinity of the Camp.
-$.'v	■	* ;s'\: *	> T'	;,.	*>'	,	''	rv,.-,	•	f
4* At AUSCHWITZ, I saw jnany instances of beatings and cruelty. I was often
beaten myself by the KAPO of my Kommando whose name was BALKU. He, often beat me
with his hand or a stick. BALKU used to say that his beatings of us were in
revenge for what *we had done to the Germans.
5* The SS head of toy Kcmoando was Ufctersoharfuhrer ELANKEE.	Although he was
in charge of my Konsnando, he had no knowledge of carpentry, with the result that
he often gabe us impossible tasks to do. When we told him that we could not do
.the work, he would beat us. His favourite weapon was a whip, and he would make
us line up and then come down the line beating us. I have been beaten many times
in this manner by BLAHKIE.
*	'i
6.	On the 18th January 1942 Obersturmfuhrer AUMAJER came to the Camp. I
mention him because of the two incidents which follow. He was particularly
concerned in these indidents, and I remember also that on one occasion he
addressed the prisoners and told them that no prisoner in the Camp had the right
to live for more than 3 weeks.
7.	On the 19th March 1942 AUMAJER was, as usual, in charge of APPEL. He had a
list in his hand find from this list he called out the names of about 180 prisoners
.These prisoners - war© formed -up into one party, I saw them being marched off
into Block 3. At this time my Koramando was working quite near to the Camp. We
went out later than usual, and some time after APPEL had finished I again saw the
party of prisoners. They were being marched from Block 3 to Block 11.
8.	In the afternoon, when I returned from work, I saw, outside Block 11, a
number of oarts loaded with dead bodies. Blood was running from the earts,
as all the carts were not covered, I could see the bodies and they did not appear
to have been dead long.	There were about 4 carts in all.
9» On the 29th October 1942 a similar thing happened at APPEL. AUMAJER again
called out from a list the .names .of a large number .of prisoners. I think there
were about 300 prisoners called out altogether. As on the previous occasion they
were marched to Block 3 and then to .Block 11, but this time, I saw that their
hands were tied, with wire, behind their backs*
10. I was living in Block 11 at this time; this block was the punishment block.
When I returned from work in the afternoon, I asked ray friends, living in the
block, what had been done with the prisoners. They told me that they had seen the
prisoners taken out into a small court-yard between Blocks 10 and 11. This court-
yard was known to us as the "Arena of Death". The prisoners were marohed into
the beatet-yard,singly, and were ordered to stand facing the wall. Each prisoner
was then shot in the back of the head, by a man named Raportfuhrer PALICW I
remember these two occasions very clearly because, although there had been other﻿occasions on which prisoners had teen shot, up to that time I had not seen or
heard of any mass executions such as these.
4m

mt
'intoer
and
11.	One man I particularly remember was PILAREK. I first saw
June 1940. He was a KAPO in charge of the Koamando which worked in
wood-yard. The prisoners working in this Kommando had to unload and stack the
wood* and it was considered a fora of punishment to bp sent to. this Kommando.	It
was often necessary for me to go to the wood-yard to collect wood for my work, and
I often saw BILAREK beating the prisoners.
'y.'-	-	•	•	j ■	k. .>	■.	1 ••	■■	■	••	s*./	».
12.	In the autumn of 1942 ft Polish Jew, who had previously worked in my
Kcaanando, was working in PILAREK'S KcmiBandp, I did not know his name, but I knew
him well by sight* One day, about this period, I Went to the wood-yard to get some
wood, and I saw this Polish Jew being pulled along the ground by P2LABEK who was
also kicking him on the body and $ tamp‘ng on his chest. The man appeared to lose
consciousness and PILAREK left him. Aifew minutes later the man began to move and
PILAREK again kicked him about the body and chest and also stamped on his face
.with the heel of his boot. When I left the wood-yard the man was lying on the
ground unconscious.	-
13*	About 2 or 3 hours later I saw 4 men of PILAREK'S Koramando carrying

in BELSEN Camp.
3.	in GROSS-ROSEN and DORA Camps I worked as lock-smith. CHUDY
was a helper in the Camp Hospital. He got this job through a friend
of his who worked in the hospital. After that man's departure CHUDY
took his place. I know that CHUDY used to give injections to patients
when ordered to do so by the medical staff. These injections were part
of the treatment. At one time I myself was suffering from heart trouble
and was given an injection by CHUDY which did me good. After my illness
I became friendly with him. .1 often came to see him at the hospital
and he was always very helpful and kind to me and to other prisoners.	He
would give me bread and food, because he used to get bigger rations from
the cookhouse. In DORA he was again euployed as "helper" in the Hospital.
There too he helped everyone as best he could by giving prisoners extra
food and trying to get more food from the stores.
4.	In BELSEN he was first hut orderly in Block 57 and later became
Blockleader of the same Block. I lived in Block 91 but came to see him
at his Block nearly every day. I have never seen him beat anybody. On
the contrary, he would give cigaretthb aridt more food to his fellow prisoners

police a part of the camp and keep order. One day approximately between
the 10th and 12th of April 1945, I was standing outside kitchen No 2
opposite Block 34 and I was to see that no unauthorised prisoner
entered the kitchen. I remember an incident when two prisoners
managed to get near- the soup kettles, which were standing behind me
outside the kitchen. One prisoner had just taken some soup out with
his cup when this SS man GOTZY came out of the kitchen together with
the kitchen chief. The two man tried to get away, and the one with the
soup succeeded, but GOTZY shot with his pistol at the other one.
The first shot missed him, it actually passed me and went through my
jacket, but the second shot hit him and he collapsed and fell on the
floor. I went to himjil, saw that he was dead, and dragged him into the
road. I informed one man of the "Lelchen Kommando", whose job it was
to remove the dead bodies, and I actually saw some men of this command©
remove the body on to a heap of corpses.

SUMMARY OP EXAMINATION OP Georg DAB-DWORSKI of POLAND duly sworn
states:-
I am 28 years of a;;e of Polish nationality born at WARSAW.
My permanent home is Marszalkowska 140, WARSAW. I am at present
living at Block G.B.6, Room 35, HOHNE (BELSEh) Camp, GERMANY.
1.	•	I lived in WARSAW and worked as a clerk on the
Electricity Board. I served in the Polish Army from 1938 until
1939. I then returned to WARSAW where I lived until 1st November
1944 when I was‘arrested by the-SS for participation in the
Warsaw rising. I was taken to a Prisoner of War Camp near
SIUTTHOF from where I escaped on 12th December 1944. I was,
however, recaptured on*the following day and tak n to a punishment
canro somewhere in the province of POZNAN where I stayed until
20th December 1944. Prom there I was sent to ILSUENGAMME where
I arrived on 26th December ]^44 .and then on 2nd March 194-5 I ?/as
Sent to MISBURG Concentration Cepp. After the evacuation of
MISBURG I was sent tp-BELSEN where I arrived on April 9th 1945
2.	In MISBURG I had a Yugoslav foreman named Boris MAT10
in charge of my working party. MATIC often brutally beat us
and behaved sadistically. I knew 5 prisoners who had to be taken
to the Sickbay as result of these beatings.
3.	He blackmailed me continuously because he knew
that I received extra food from my cousin who was a Polish
Prisoner of War, and as such, received Red Cross parcels. On
one occasion MATIC wanted me to hand over part of that food.
When I said he could only have some of the cigarettes he hit
me on the chest with a brick and tried to hit me on the head
with it but was prevented by 2 Polish Prisoners of War. I
suffered from pains in the chest for 3 weeks aft:r that.
4.	MATIC took food away from every prisoner in his
party, not only extra food, but also the daily rations.
5.	He was on very good terms with the SS, and tried
to join the force. Sometimes he would go with SS guards (Volks-
deutsche from Yugoslavia) into an air raid shelter and beat a
prisoner with a board from the working site. This happened to
me twice. He first s: nt the guard into the shelter, then
ordered me to go in and then followed himself. He and the guard
beat me for lo" or 15 minutes, his under foreman meanwhile
watching out for the Oberfeldwebel.
6.	One day I came back from work and was taken before
the Chief Capo, Pranz WAGNER, There MATIC denounced me. He
misrepresented the connection with my cousin as a "secret
organisation", and in consequence I was beaten by MATIC and
WAGNER, my shoes were taken away and MATIC kept them.
7.	Later I was declared as "likely to escape" and was
to be marked with the appropriate sign. This was a white patch
witha red spot, worn on the left side of the chest, on the right
leg and on the back, and made one look like a walking targets
I did not actually get that sign because the camp was evacuated
3 days after.
8.
After this beating, the feared guard WINTER was sent﻿out with my working party. I
a Frenchman and a Belgian.
was present when V/INTER
9*	MATIG was evacuated with us to BELSM and was in
charge of the Ordnungsdienst (Gamp Police). He behaved towards
the prisoners in exactly the same way as at MISBURG.

first man, dragged him away from the other guard, and pushed him along
in front of him. After they walked a short distance WINTER fired

2..	One day I was ill and was lying in the RBVIER. I looked
out of the window and saw about thirty sink prisoners being taken
out and shot — they were men women and children. They wfere shot
about ten to fifteen metres away from me;- this wasabout three or four
months after I arrived in the Gamp. The shooting was done by
BARG MANN and a firing squad from RADOM belonging to the: '3D.
BARGMANN himself shot with a rifle; I actually saw him' shoot.
A Jewish Doctor selected the people to be shot on his own authority.
I was not included in those to be shot because I am a tradesman.
I would describe BARGMANN as follows; Aged between 40 and 50,. about _
1.80 metres in height. Black hair, slim build, has two fingers missing
from either the right or the left hand, clean shaven, grey eyes,
complexion pale.
3.	on another' occasion I saw a man being taken by BARGMANN._
This man was naked, andtried to escape; he was shot by BARGMANN in
the field. I cannot remember the date on which this happened. The
body was buried in the. Gamp.
4^	p remember another incident when fifteen men were, told
to dig a ditch. When the ditch was completed they were told to
strip; they were then shot by BARGMANN and the SD from RADOM and
buried in the ditch. I actually saw the shooting; I was in my
Block which was about 50 metres from the scene . The victims
were shot with rifles, firing dum-dum bullets.
5	x did not witness any further shootings myself, but when
returning to Gamp one day I saw about eighty bodies of men, women
and children lying on the ground inside the Gamp. I was told by
the prisoners who had to bury the bodies that the numoer was eighty.
All the eighty bodies were buried in one grave, which I went to see.
The shooting took place in the afternoon - I saw the bodies at
about 6 o'clock at night. I think this incident occurred m the
month of. December 1942. I cannot say whether there were any other
people aoart from the eighty already described, shot on this
occasion. * My mother, who was also an. inraate of the Gamp, told me
that BARGMANN had selected these eighty people as they were_under
nourished and ill looking. I am living with my Mother m BBLSEN

duly sworn states:
I am 24 years of age, of polish nationality (polish Jew) bom
at RADOM. My permanent home, is RADOM ZEROMSKIBGO 78, Poland.
I am- at present living at BELSEN Gamp II, Block 87,, Room 1.9
I was arrested in 1941 and sent, to WOLAHOW LUFTWAFFE
1
RADOM II Labour Gamp at the beginning of 1942. I was sent from
this Gamp to STARACHOWIGA at the end of 1942 or the beginning of
1943.
During the period I was imprisoned in RADOM II a German
2
named BERGMAM or BARGMAEN was a Lagerfuhrer. The Gamp
Commandant was RUBER. BERGMAKU or BARGMANN was known as the
"Komissar".
Shortly after my arrival in the Gamp,, I saw BERGMAa®
3,
shoot nine Jewish men in the Gamp. One of these men was shot
because he had let a piece of burning coal burn a small hole
in the hut floori.	I do not know why the others were shot. I
was about 70 metres away when these men were shot; BERGMANN shot,
some of the men, the others were shot by Ukrainian SD. The
bodies were buried in the Gamp. One of the victims name was
ACKERMAHH* Leibica.
4..	m the winter of 1942 I saw the bodies of 130 men,
women and children who had been esecuted in the Gamp. I did
not see these pepple shot but many inmates told me that these
people were sick and had been killed by selection of BERGMAEU.
BERGMANN‘i I was told, took part in the shooting, others in the.
firing soad were Ukrainian SD. My father-in-law was one of the
men shot on this occasion. I know of a child whose father was
also one of the victims.
5.	i heard of an occasion when BERGMAJM caught a prisoner
coming from the Womens' Gamp. It was general knowledge that
this man was shot by BERGMAIW in the Camp. Several prisoners
saw this execution but I do not knov/ their nanes.
6.	All prisoners were afraid of BERGMANN because he killed
so many, for no real reason. I saw BBRGMANN kill nine men; he
killed many more but I was a witness to the death of nine only.
X think he ordered the killing of about 400 Jews in the Camp.
7.	I never saw RUBER kill anyone but I think he killed_ the
brother of Kiwa ROZENBURG. There were so many executions in
the Gamp that I cannot say how many RUBER was responsible lor
and hovf many BERGMANN was responsible for.

I am 36 years of age. I am a polish Jew, and was horn at WOLALTOV/.
My permanent home is RADOM’, LZLEOZEA 25, Poland. I am at jJ^esent
living in BEI2EN Gamp III, Block 19, Room 17.
1.	I was sent to WOLAWOW LUPTWAPPE RADOM II Work Gamp in
August 1942 and remained there until August YM'fh
2.	During that time BARGMARN or- BERGMAITR was a Lagerfuhrer, the
Gamp Commandant was named RUBI or RUBER.
3.	In Novemher or December 1942 I was one of about a thousand
prisoners paraded because there were -too many prisoners in the Gamp.
BERGHANL. and another man selected 130 men, women and children from
the parade. The sick, under nourished and those in pcs session of
money and valuables were those selected. immediately after the
selection I saw all these 130 people shot by BARG!'ANN and Ukrainian
SD. The execution was carried out in the Gamp before the whole '
parade. The firing party	used riflesj	there	were	about 20 men
in this squad. I clearly	saw BARGMANR	shoot	shot	after shot to
kill these victims. All the bodies were buried in two graves in
the Gamp. The execution took about an hour; I saw it from start
to finish. My cousin, :0NIK GOLDBERG was one of those killed
on this occasion. Many of the victims tried to escape but were
soon shot down* One A3BI BBUUAH ! was also a victim of tnis exec-
ution.
4.	in about March 1943 I saw BERGHAjM shoot 15 prisoners who
had been sent from RADOM.	I do not know why	they	were killed; they
were all Doctors or professors. I was	about	50 metres away from
this execution. BERGMANN used a rifle. He also had some
Ukrainian 3D to help him.
5.	i saw no other executions by BERG ALkT, but during the time
I was at the Gamp there were very many executions. It was generally
known that BERGMANS' had killed about 300 prisoners_either by killing
them himself, by participating in the actual shooting with others,
or by ordering their deaths at others hand
6.	I never saw RUBER kill anyone but I heard from fellow
prisoners that RUBER killed two Jews by shooting them. I do not
know why they were killed. I think the brother of KIWAK ROZErffiSRG
was one of RUBER'S victims.

/ I am 34. years of age, of polisli Jewish nationality, born at RADOM,
Poland, oh the 7th April 1913. My permanent home is LUBLIN',:
Karwieczka 123. I am at present living at BELSEN Gamp 2, Block
81, Room 19.
1*	I was imprisoned in WOLONOW LUFTWAFFE RADOM II Labour Camp
. from May or June 1342 until the latter part of 1943. Throughout"
this period a German named BERGIANN or BARGMANN was in charge of all
the Jewish prisoners in the Gamp. inspector RUBER of the Luftwaffe
was the Commander of the Gamp.
2.	About five or six months after my arrival in the Gamp, I saw
the sick who could not walk lying on their beds. The Lagerfuhrer,
BERGMANN or BARGMANN came to the Block and selected fifteen or sixteen
males from the sick who were then shot by RUBER and SD Men from RADOM.
I did not actually sea the shooting but I saw the dead bodies lying
on the ground in the Gamp;. I had tobury them. RUBER told me after
the execution that he had taken part in it; he added that he had
finished off one of the dying men and that on another occasion he,
RUBER, had shot the Capo of my working party. This Capo's name
was BLACHMANNJ a German Jew.
3.	The victims of the second execution, which took place about
October or November 1942 were selected by BARGMANN and BANACH.
Two thousand prisoners were paraded and about 130 sick or under
nourished were selected by these men to be shot. I saw these
victims shot by the SD, BARGLANN waspresent but did not shoot.
BARGMANN gave theorder to shoot. The bodle^ were buried inside the
Gamp near the barbed wire. The executedj,ca? this occasion were
men, women and children. The firing souad was made up of about
twenty to thirty men. ‘They used rifles to kill the prisoners; this
took place at about
4.	in 1942‘, I cannot remember the time of the year,, one man was
put into the bunker and beaten with a dog whip by BARGMANN. When
taken outside this man tried to escape and was shot in the leg by
BARGMANN;. he was re-captured by the Gamp police. I then sa?/
BARGMANN shoot this man through the head. I was standing about
20 to 30 metres away at the time. The man wns lying on the ground
when BARGMANN shot him. He was baried in the Gamp. I cannot
remember the man's name.
5.	I have seen BARGMANN shoot groups of men, women and children
on various occasions. Sometimes I saw him shoot children; on other
occasions I saw him shoot groups ofmen and women and again parties
of men or women. On such occasions BARGIvANN shot these people on
his own. For all such executions I saw BARGMANN use a revolver.
The victims were always shot inside the Gamp., These people wrere
shot for trying to, trade bits of their clothing for food.
6.	»	I do not know the names of those killed because we were all
known by numbers in the Gamp.
7.	in all, I would say that BARGMANN has ordered the execution
of about 300 men, women and children. This is only an approximate
figure because executions were an everyday occurrance. I think﻿BARGLLffiKE has killed a hundred or more men, women and children
himself. I have actually seen him kill approximately twenty such
victims.

Detailed to examine the above by
C-in-C, British Army of the Rhine.﻿duly sworn states;
I am 30 years of age, of polish nationality horn at WOLANOW, Poland
on 15 Ap^il 1945. My permanent home is wsrtf.
I am at present living at BELSEN CampBloek 70, Room 20.
1.	I was arrested on the 15th July 1942 because I arn a Jew.
I wassent to WOLANOW LUFTWAFFE RADOM II, which was a Work Camp, and
remained there until the 20th June 1943, when i was transferred
to S3 BLIC2INI Camp, near LUBLIN. On 25th July 1. 44 I wassent to
AUSCHWITZ, andwas there until the 25th October 1944. I was then
transferred to DACHAU, where I remained until liberated on the
2nd May 1945 by the American forces.
2.	Whilst I was at RADOM I knew a man named BABGLIANN, who was
in charge of all Jewish personnel in the Camp, and who wasknown
as the "Kommisar". The officer commanding the whole camp Yra.s
Chief Engineer RUBER, from STUTTGART. When the first prisoners
arrived at RADOM BARG.ANN ordered 30 people to be shot under the
pretence that they were lazy. This was on the 10th September 1942.
Whilst the prisoners were at work digging trenches for the Luftwaffe
BARGMANH went around the working site and pointed at several people
who were suppcs ed to be lazy. He then marched them off to a
special hut provided for this purpose and gave them a beating with
a^wooden stick. They were then taken to the Camp, to a special
compound, and placed in a hut guarded by Jewish police. BSRGMAHH
and RUBER then sentenced these people to death and informed the SD
in RADOM. The SD arrived half an hour later and the prisoners
were shot by Russian volunteers for the Germans. Thirty polish
jews were shot on this occasion; no trial was held; BARG11ANN and
RUBER merely gave orders for these people to be shot. I actually
saw this happen. The people were taken out of the hut and marched
to a corner of the Camp where they were shot by the SD. I was
working as a tailor at the time and was approximately 100 metres
away from the place at which the shooting occurred, which took
place at about 5 o'clock in the afternoon. At 10 o'clock in
the mcrning I Was told by some inmates of the Camp that BARGMAHH
had selected thirty men from the working party, and that they had
then been placed in the hut at about.5 o'clock. I saw the
lorry containing the Russian volunteers arrive and the prisoners
being shot.	The prisoners were all men, andwere not bound; they
were deprived of all their valuables by RUBER and BARGMAHN prior
to being shot; I actually saw RUBER and BARGMAHN taking their
valuables.	The corpses were buried in the same place as the
shooting took place, by prisoners who had to dig a ditch for this
purpose.
(tP*

3.	a few days after the above incident 110 people were shot
on the orders of BARGMANN.	At approximately 3 o'clock in the
afternoon we were all told to go into the Camp and stand against
the barbed wire fence by BARGMANN. BARGMANN and his Gardener,
a pole named BANACH, then came along, and we had to stand in one
line; BARGMANN then made a selection of people who were either
under nourished or were suffering from any disease. Those who were
selected were shot at about 7 o'clock in theevening by Russian
volunteers, in the presence of RUBER and BARGL1ANN. They were shot
with rifles at 30 metres distance, and dum-dum ammunition Was used.
All those selected were shot at the same time. There were about
30 SD in the firing squad.	The bodies were buried in two
ditches, one containing 80, and the other 30, the following
morning;, this I was told by prisoners who had to bury the dead.
At the time of the shooting I was told by SUIU38. not to go- anywhere
near the Camp, nor to allow my eight men, who were tailors, to go
there. I was working: at the time and kept in the Luftwaffe
building, in which the prisoners were kept until the shooting.
-1-﻿
I did not see the shooting, hut when I returned to Camp that night
I saw the bodies lying near the barbed wire fence. The order to
fire was given by an 3D Man who was in charge of the Russians;
„^£aw this SD Man myself - he was a senior SCO.. The dum-dum
'■lets used by the firing squad were bullets which had been cut
grc the front,, and the effect of them was that ?/hen they hit a
person on the head the head just disappeared. The first of the
party to be shot were selected by BARGMANN on the road from the
Mens' Camp to the Womens' Camp.
4.	Nine men were shot on the 10 January 1943. I am able to
remember dates because I was not in the working party who were
continuously being selected, but had a quiet job, e.ndwas able to
keep a chack on the dates. The first two selected were Jews; they
were shot because they made a fire, in their room and a piece of
coal fell out of it andburned a little hole in the floor. The
other seven were Jewish people who were brought into the Caurp and
shot with the other two for no reason whatever. The same firing
squad shot them1 on orders from BARGMANN.
5.	The total number of deaths by shooting was approximately
150 - 170 men; They were all shot on the orders of BARGIIAHN and RUBER.
RUBER is the senior of the two. BARGMANN is now_living in SOLTAU.
I actually witnessed the shooting of the first thirt people, described
above, but I did not actually witness the shooting of the other
people; I saw their bodies lying on the ground.

1.	I was arrested in the autumn of 1942 and taken to the Ghetto at WILNO. In the
autumn of 1943 I was transferred to various LABOUR CAMPS in ESTHQNIA and from there
came to the CONCENTRATION CAMP at STUTTHCF nr. DANZIG, in August 1944. Subsequently
I was taken to SCHOMBERG CONCENTRATION CAMP and arrived at BELSEN in February 1945*
2.	I have been shown a photograph marked ”^/5/l0" and I recognise No. 40 thereon a*
an SS man whom I first met at BELSEN CONCENTRATION CAMP. I did not know his name,
which I am now told is KARL SCHMITT.
3.	At BELSEN I lived in Block 15 in the mens’ camp No.l. This Block was filled with
sick prisoners, the majority of which were unable to get up and be present at the
daily" morning Appels. SCHMITT was one of the many SS men who came round in the
morning to check the prisoners and to take the roil call at these Appels. Their
method consisted in getting as many of the sick and weak prisoners on parade as
possible. For that purpose they would enter the block and, using brutal force, would
make the men get up by beating and kicking them with sticks, ihovels, fists, hands
and boots. On these occasions SCHMITT behaved like a ferocious savage, and his
appearance in the block was enough to make, whoever was able to, run away or get into
hiding.
44 About a month before the British arrived at BELSEN I was lying in this block,
suffering from an open, festering wound on my right thigh as a result of a beating with
a shovel by one of our hut-orderlies, named JOSEF MAGIERA. (Because this hut-orderly
vised to steal our breadration and exchange it for other food and cigarettes, I
reported him to the "Blockalteste". Ever since then MAGIERA was on my heels,
threatened and beat me for the slightest offence or for no reason whatever) • On that
morning, SCHMITT came round as usual to chase the sick prisoners out. I could hardly
move; he saw me lying there and started to beat me savagely with a wooden stick
across my face, arms, shoulders and kicked me with his bootd on my body and my legs.

DEPOSITION OP IRENE GLUCK, late of MDKACE70, Duchnovicova Czechoslovakia,
sworn before Lieut-Colonel THOMAS MIIRPHEEY TILLING, Royal Artillery,
No.l War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 20 years of age and a Jewess. I was arreatec^as^a. Jewess and
placed in the Ghetto at Mukacevo where I remained until	19ii4| on this
date I was transferred to Auschwitz. On 20th. August 19^1-4 I was sent to
Unterliies Camp and stayed there until 13 th. April 1945 when I was transferred to
Belsen.
2.	I worked in various Aussenkornmandos at IMTEKLttSS and was employed as hut
orderly and servant in the SS women quarters. Later I worked in the SS men's
barracks in the same capacity. In addition I was also hut orderly in Block
No. 2.
3.	At Unterldss I knew' an SS woman called SUSANNE HILLE, she worked in a
supervisory capacity in the Camp and did not go out with the working parties.
She used to beat internees for minor offences v/ith a leather or ruboer truncheon
or with the bare hand. On one occasion in September 1944> after the return
of the working parties, HELLE went rand the blocks and fouhd Slock 2, in which
I was a hut orderly, in an untidy state. She ordered all the irunates of
this block, including the hut orderlies and the Blockleader to line up in front
of the block. She then proceeded to strike the girls with the palm of heir hand
on the face and head; I myself v;as hit by HILLE in this way.
4.	During the winter months of 1944 -45 I remember a further example of
her brutality to the prisoners. One morning, whilst we were parading in front
of the blocks about to be allocated to the various working parties, there were
some prisoners required for a special outside working party. On account of the
cold and because the prisoners were insufficiently clothed, many of them
showed considerable reluctance in joining this working party. HILLE, who was
on this parade and supervised the allocations, ordered me to. fetchir her
rubber trunqheon from her room.. When I gave it to her she proceeded to beat
the assembled prisoners with the rubber truncheon in a most brutal way. She
hit them on Hie head and shoulders indiscriminately and I myself was amongst
those hit; I had pains for several days after the incident.
5.	In February 1945, 500 of the 900 women prisoners at Unterlttss
Gamp were sent to Belsen Camp. I do not know from whom the order? came but
I do know, as I witnessed the incident,tthat HILLE alone selected these 500
girls for BELSEN at a special parade. She took the weak and all the side
fron the Camp Hospital and all those who were useless for heavy work. It was
common knowledge amongst the prisoners that if they were sent to Belsen it meant
certain death and when we vfere finally transferred to Belsen ourselves we only
met a few of this transport still alive.
6.	In September or October 1944, UNTSSL&SS camp came under the command of
Hauptman HEROICS of the Jehrmacht who was a relatively harmless man and did not
take any interest in the activites of the camp. Directly under him and
in reality if not in name the real Camp Commandant was Hauptscharfuhrer RUDOLF
HAMDT, He left Unterldss during the winter of 1944-45 came back About
February 1945. During his absence the virtual Commandant was Unterscharfuhrer
HAMS SIECEER,
7.	During his first period at Unterldss FANDT behaved decently towards the
prisoners. However when he returned he was induced by HILLE to adopt stronger
methods of dealing with the prisoners; I often heal’d HI LE tell him that
he treated the prisoners too leniently . Finally he adopted the same
methods of punishment as KELLE+and I have often seen him beating the prisoners
with a rubber truncheon or with his hands.
8.	Unterscharfuhrer HANS STICKER was the worst Commandant, we had and
frequently beat the prisoners with a rubber truncheon.﻿9*	During the winter months we all suffered from the bitter cold
(because of insufficient clothing or food. Some girls in order to combat the
cold would put paper 'under their clothes, and wrap themselves in blankets
prior 'to. putting on their clothes. This was not allowed and STEOKER used to
examine the girls on parade and if he found any girl v/ith a blanket or
any other supplementary clothing he would punish her severely. On every
one of these parades there would be some of the prisoners set aside for
wearing additional clothing or blankets and after the parade they would be
taken to Block +No.3 and there■STEGKER would inflict 25 strokes with a
rubber truncheon on the buttocks. The lageralteste had to march the
prisoners to the block but nobody was allowed to be present at the beatings.
I have seen girls come out from the block after the punishment in a terrible
state and some of them had pains for weeks after. Despite this they still
had to go out for work immediately.

was beaten by STECKER. On one of the morning
strong and healthy girl, was found to be wearing a blanket round her body.
STECEER beat her in the manner described aboe and although J did not witness
the punishment X saw her being marched to Block No.3'vand later saw her come
out again. She had changed completely and was in great pain. The next day
she had to be admitted to the Gamp Hospital and she died there a few weeks
laterj I am certain of this because I saw her body in the Hospital.
11.	I would describe HILLE as about 22 years of age, 1,65 Hits, dark

good teeth. Her parent1 s home is at ^Xtenherg or iltenburg, 1M©T I would

to Sacksenhamsen Concentration Camp* From there I was transferred ALT GAHGEN and
on the 15 th Fanuary 194-5 was sent to NEUSNGAVME. After four days at NEDENGAMMS I
was sent to MIESBURG and I arrived at BELSEN on the 8th April 1945*
2* In MIESBURG I met for the first time HUGO LIEHMAM. One days I was in
LISHMAM’s working party and he found some sliced of sugar beet on me* For that
offence LIEHMAM hit me in the face with his fist many times until, ny face was
covered with blood* I still have scars on ay face from this beating.
3* The; farmer® used to give LIEHMAM food for the working party but instead of
sharing this food out amongst the prisoners, LIEHvIMN would keep it all himself
and exchange it for Schnapps and when he was drunk would come around and beat us
brutally.
4* The *SS Camp guards, August SCHILLER included, wore S3 badg^fe in MIESBURG but
removed tham just before or on the move to BSLSEN. The SS men expected to be put
against the wall by the Allies, if caught, and hoped to get better treatment posing
as Wehrmacht soldiers. There were some old .guards at the camp who wer<J not SS men
but Wehrmacht soldiers. These men did not ijaltreat us.

My permanent home is> Gdynia, Poland*
I am at x^resent living at* Block 77» Room 25, Bergen-Belsen Camp, Germany.
1. I lived, at Gdynia until the outbreak of war when I joined up. I was taken
Prisoner of War on the 19th October 1939 and after my release I worked, as a
civilian, in ARNSWALDE, Germany. 'In 1944- I was arrested by the German Landwaom:
for infringing,the*curfew and sent to NEUMGAMME Concentration Gamp, by the Gestapo.
After about two weeks NEUENGAMME I was taken to MH5SB0RG where I met Unteroffxzxer
YOTTEE. and the Vbrarbeiter Hugo LTEHMANN.
2. 'TO'ITSR was notorious in the whole camp and was the most feared guard*. One
day I ms present and saw WINTER shoot a Frenchman and a Belgian. My party were
working in" an oil refinery and a German civilian said that liis sandwiches had been
stolen. The German foreman,$iigrisoner hijnsel?, told WINTER that these two men
had taken the sandwiches. WINTER then took the men into his own working party.
He obviously wanted to shoot than but had to wait as there were too many other
workers, civilians and prisoners, nearby. A little later, I had just come out
of a shed I saw WINTER about 10-15 metres away. He was resting his.rifle
on a wall^and then fired two shots at the two prisoners. I don‘t know xf he rat
them but one fell and the other ran away. WINTER told me to watch the other
prisoners and ran after the man who hAc. run away.
3. The prisoner tried to ask another' guard for protection from WINTER but .OTTER
fulled the prisoner awav from that guard and took him back to the party. When Ithe
prisoner walked ±n front of him WINTER fired a shot, the third, and the man fell.
The other working party took Min back to camp.
4. WINTER then came to look for the other victim who, meanwhile, had come
hearer to our group and sat down crying* When WINTER saw liim he fired the fourth
shot from about 20 yds. and the man fell to the ground.	He had been hit in
the chest but was not killed out-right. A short while later TTINTSR noticed that
the man was still alive and shot him in the head from about 2-3 metres distance.
That was the fifth shot. Later on the Rapportfuhrer came and gave orders to
remove the bodisto the camp where all the prisoners were forced to see the dean
mm as a warning example against "attempted escape". I can testify that the men
did not try to escape.

FURTHER SUMMARY OF EXAMINATION OF FTTEL Aloizy duly sworn states
1.
With regard to the incident described in the third paragraph of
my Deposition, now read out to me and sworn on 6tlm November 1945# I
would like to add that I did not see the incident described in that paragraph.
Although I was standing close at hand at the time iry view was impeded by an
oil tank. I did, however, hear the shot fired and I was told about the
incident later on the same day by some fellow internees who actually saw the
incident. On the return of WINTER he said to me "That one is finished".
2.	Regarding paragraph four of the aforesaid deposition, now read out
to me, I would further add that the whole incident was witnessed by me.
5.	I have been asked Miether I can give any further details
conceming the 50 deaths mentioned in paragraph five of my aforesaid deposition,
now read out to me. I have seen many serious beatings administered by
LIEHMANH aitd also saw many of the internees so beaten taken to the sick
bay by fellow internees, but of the actual deaths I have only been told about
than by other internees.
4.	I do however recollect the following incident which occured
at flESBURG CMP:-
On one occasion I saw LIEHMAM beat a half starved Italian
prisoner, with his hands and with a stick;#he also kicked him. In the
evening of the same day I saw two men take the man to Hospital. The
following day I went to the Hospital myself as-1 was sick and I was in bed
in the same room as the Italian prisoner. Two or three days later this
Italian died and I was present when the Doctor - a French Internee- came
and examined the man and I heard the Doctor say that he was dead. In
addition I also saw the corpse being removed and it is my opinion that the
direct cause of the men’s death was the beatings administered by LIEEvIANN

Of SmiRNIEWICE,

I ajn at present living atf Room 26, Block Borgen-Belsen Gamp, Gannany.
1. I was a Butcher in Poland until my arrest on the 8th August 1944» I was
arrested for my participation in the rising in Warsaw. The S3 sent me to
SACHSENHAU3EN Concentration Camp. After about two weeks I was transferred Ixy
HEDENGAMME Concentration Canip where I was put in a working party. Later I was
transferred to MIESBUEG- Concentration Camp and I arrived at Belsen about 8th
April- 19b5*	■	*...........» • .
2.	In H/rTR.qBT-ma I saw for the first time Hugo L3SMANN vfao was my foreman. Our
working party worked for a firm called PROIZAK which was engaged on the clearing up
of damage after air raids. LIEHMAM was well known for his brutality. He used to
beat prisonerd for no reason at all and his working party was taiown as the worst, and
was fceally considered a punishment squad,and when other foremen were dissatified with
their prisoners they sent them to LIEHMANN’s scjtd. On the working site LIKHMAM used
to beat the prisoners so severely that they had to be taken to the REVISE,or sick bay,
where they usually died after two or three days.
3.	A fri^cl of mine, a Russian whose Christian name was Boris but whose sunoame
I cannot remember, was seen by a German farmer picking up beetroot and eating them.
The farmer reported this to LIEBMAM who heat	my friend so severely that	he	died
half an hour after being taken to the REVIER.	The beating was	inflicted	by	kicking
with heavy boots and by beating on the back with a club.
4.	Another case I remember concerned another friend of mine named Y/ladystaw
KOKARSKI. He was beaten in the face, with LEHMANN*s fists, so severely that KONARSKI's
face was covered with blood. KOKARSKI is at present living in Bergen-Belsen Camp,
Block 76.
5.	I myself have been beaten by LEHMANN and my am was broken by him on the march
from MIESBURG to EEBSEN. In the evening we were herded into a bam where about 75<3
prisoners were guarded by 2 SS men and A foremen. We were very tired after the march
and settled down on the floor to sleep. The	2 SS men and the	4 foremen	walked up
and down the lines beating us without reason.	LEHMANN tried	to bit me	on	the head
with a heavy stick. He swung the stick with both hands and I held up my arm to
protect mv head. The force of the 13ow broke my aim completely and I cried out in pain.

again*
8. WINTER did not cane afi the move fran MXESBHRG To BELSEN but stayed in MTESBURG

killed by TONTSR.personally.

SUMMARY OF EXAIvIINATIOH OF Henryk FORSTER of POLALIL duly sworn
states:-
I am 31 years of age of Polish nationality horn at OZERIIOWOE,
ROUMAHIA. My permanent home is KRASZEWSKIEGO 7, JASLO, POLAND.
I am at present living at Block OB 6, Room 35, HOHNE (BELSEN)
Gamp, GERMANY.
1.	I was arrested by the Gestapo at JASLO on 22nd
September 1943 because I was a member of the secret Polish Army.
After eight days at the Gestapo Headquarters at JASLO I was sent
to AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp on 1st October 1943 and on
23rd October 1943 I was transferred to the Concentration Gamp
at BUG HENWALD.	About the 15th December 1943 I was sent to
DUSSELDORF with an Arbeitskommando but returned to BUCHENWALD
on the 9th March 1944 because of sickness. At the end of June
1944 I was transferred to the Concentration Camp at MIESBURG
near HANNOVER and remained there until the 5th April 1945.
The Gamp was then evacuated to BELSEN where I remained until
liberated by the British on the 15th April 1945.
2.	I knew a man in the Camp at MIESBURG named MATIC. He
was a foreman of a working party and on roll call he beat
prisoners in the face and kicked them with his hoots if they
fell to the ground. I was a foreman myself and tried to stop
him but he would not listen.
3.	I have seen British Prisoners of War giving bread to
MATIC for his working party and showing him with gestures to
distribute it. MATIC always kept it for himself and what he
could not eat he exchanged for cigarettes. I saw this happen
several times and when a prisoner in his working party named
Kasimir GOS (Belsen, Block 91, Room 15,) complained to me about it,
I told the British soldier who usually handed MATIC the food.
4.	One day MATIC told me that he had voluntered to join
the S3 in response to an S3 request for volunteers to go to
NORWAY. The whole camp was evacuated soon after, before his
release papers arrived, so he was unsuccessful.
5.	MATIC was evacuated with us to BELSEN and was in charge
of the "Ordnungsdienst" (Camp Police) and was as brutal towards
the prisoners as he was at MIESBURG.

I tun at Tj re sent living atf Belsen-Holme Camp 1, Block L 11, Room 29.
1.
Because I was a Jewess I was arrested in the Spring of 1913 and
placed in tne G-hetto at SOSKOWICE, where I remained until the 1th August, 1913.
I was then transferred to AUSCHWITZ. In August, 1911, I v/as sent to° BEL3SN. and
alter eignt days was transferred to UWTEHLUSS Camp, where I stayed until the 13th
April, 1915j on vdiich date I was returned to BELSEN again.
n	Prom August, 19H, until April, 1915, I worked as dentist in the
Dental Room at IMTSKLOSS Camp. It was common Imowledge that the Camp was run by
an 33 wanan named Susanne HUiLE, who used to beat prisoners for minor offences. "
These beatings took place in the washroom or in the empty block No. 3, and sometimes
zn the Dental Room in Block No. 1.
> _ .	Onf evening in January, 1915, imiE entered the Dental Room with
a prisoner, a Hungarian woman of about 12 years of age, whose name I have forgotten.
j-iILLE	a rubber truncheon and a whip with her. She ordered me and the
patients to leave the room. I went to my block, which was situated opposite
block No. 1, and there I could hear screaming and moaning coming from the Dental Room.
It was ^obvious to me that HH1LE was beating the woman. The victim told me
herself later that her crime had consisted of queuing up twice for soup.	The
screaming went on for about twenty minutes, after which HILLS came to tell me that
I could again enter tne room. r/hen I did so the prisoner had gone. After about
hcili an hour her little daughter came to fetch me to see her mother who was in great
pain. ^ one live(l next door to me in Room. No. 1. I examined her and found numerous
red fuid blue oraises all over the length of her back and buttocks as a result of the
savage eating. Although she suffered for days afterwards and was scarcely able to
walk, she had to go on Appel next morning and go out to work.

I am at present living at* BELSM-Hohne Oatnp, Block GB 5, Room. 63.
1,
Because 1 refused to have my name put on the German "Volksliste"
I was arrested on the 3.7th February, 1940, at GDYNIA, and was sent to STUTTHOF
Concentration Camp, near DANZIG, where I remained until August, 1941 • I then
escaped to CRACOW, Bland, but was re-arrested there in March, 1943, and taken to
the prison there. On the 10th April, 1943, 1 was sent to AUSCHWITZ, and on the
6th August, 1943, was transferred to BUNA Camp. I remained there until January,
1945, until transferred to DORA Concentration Camp. At the beginning of April,
1945, I came to BELSEN.
2.	I atm a professional musician and at AUSCHWITZ I was a member of
the Men's Camp Orchestra, I knew P3LAREK only in so far as his activities im
the Camp proper are concerned, because I never worked in an Aussenkonmando.
PILAREE was Capo of the 'Carpentercommendo", and I got to know him, and his gang
when they were building a stage for our orchestra.
3.	I have never seen him beat anyone in his working party, nor ill
treat any of the prisoners in the Camp. I never heard any member of his Commando
complain about him. If he had been a. very bad man I, too, would have known of it,
because all the bad capos were very well known in the Canp. However, I would like
to add that I did not know very much about what was going on outside the Camp,
and I am therefore unable to vouch, for PILAREK's activities as far as outside
work is concerned.
I have this day seen Anselm PILAHEK at Belsen Detention Cells and
the man PILAHEK previously referred to by me in this Deposition.

﻿
S U 1.1 1.1 ARY of E^X A k I M A T I 0 I\f of Reva CYTmT, Stateless,
duly sworn states:
:: ly‘'
I am twenty-five years of age, formerly of Polish nationality, bom at
KIELCE, Poland. My permanent home is P.ranzstrasse 30 Lodz, Poland.
I am at present living at LtfBEGK, Sant Anna Strasse 11/13
1.	As I am a Jewess I was talren to the Lodz,Ghetto on the
1st May, 1940, and had to live there until the 28th August, 1944.
I was then taken to AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp for four days, and
from there went to STUDHOF Concentration Camp near DANZIG until the
22nd April, 1945. That day we were sent by ship to KEEL, where we
arrived on the 2nd May, 1945- I was then taken to the hospital at
KROHSNSHAGEN for too weeks and from there to the SCHAFSTEDT Hospital
where I remained until the 24th July, 1945•
2.	I recognise the man on photograph DPS/l as a man whan
I know by the name of Hans BIIB0¥. He was in charge of the Lodz Ghetto
during the whole time I was there.
3.	In December, 1940, I was put in charge against my will
of all the Ghetto community kitchens, and I got to know then that on
BIEBOU's orders no one was allowed to draw more than 0.70 litres of soup
and 250 grammes of bread a day. This was c^uite Insuf 1 icient, especiallj
during the winter months, and up to June, 1942, 50,000 people actually
died from starvation. I know this figure to be true becaus# having been
in charge of the kitchens I received particulars as to the population
of the Ghetto once a month from the statistical department, ana auso
received details of all transports that left Lodz, so I can say that the
figure of 50,000 did not include any of those who left with the transports.
I saw how the bodies of inmates of the Ghetto used to swell up due to
undernourishment, and how 'islwit many such people dropped down dead in ohe
streets.
4.	in August, 1941, 55,000 fit Jews arrived at the Ghetto
from Germany. Their statistics were ke t separately, and the figures
showed that not more than 1,600 of these were still alive by August, 1944«
The others had died as a result of the undernourishment.
In November or December, 1941, BIEB0W issued an order
that all those who had ever committed an offence of any sort, even a
minor offence such as stealing a turnip or a.few potatoes,_were to be^
rounded up. According to the figures supplied to me as kitchen chie,.
there were in all about 10,000 people rounded up on this occasion.
I was told by other inmates of the Ghetto that they had been put into
railway trucks and taken away.
g.	In mid-August, 1942, BIBB0W and his men went round
the various villages in the Province of Lodz. All Jewish children and
elderly Jewish people were loaded into railway trucks on BlnBOl.1 s
instructions and nothing was ever heard of them again. All others were
also loaded into trucks and I was present when they arrived at Lodz
thirty-six hours later. BIEBCM was there, too, and as usual
supervised proceedings. when the trucks were unsealed and opened we
found that l6o persons had been crammed into each truck and very many had
died from suffocation. Those who had survived were in a terrible state
as they had had no water during the journey and it was extremely hoo.
The women were crying out for their children who had been taken away	_
from them. BILBO, then made a speech saying that the^nevv arrivals s o .a
forget what had happened and get to work as tney were﻿- 2 -
y.	On the 1st September, 19^2, BIEBOW issued an order
blat no one must leave his house for two days. As I was in charge of the
kitchens I had a special pass and was not confined to ray house. I was
therefore able to witness how under BIEBOW's directions the three
hospitals in the Ghetto were liquidated. I saw the naked bodies of the
sick and children thrown on to lorries outside the hospitals. They were
piled on to the lorries as high as possible and those underneath had to
suffocate. I saw BIEBOW supervising this evacuation and he personally
shot anybody who appeared on the streets during those two days. I, myself,
saw six people being shot by BIEBOW during this period. I particularly
remember one woman, who had come near to the hospital to try to save her
child. BIEBOW got hold of her, lifted her hair and shot her through the
back of the neck. She died instantly. I know that all the six people
whom I had seen shot by BIEBOW died because they were buried in the
Ghetto cemetery two days later.
8.	Oil the 8th September, 1942, BIEBOW ordered that no one
must leave his house for eight days. He then ordered whole streets to be
blocked off and with a gang of six of his men went from house to house.
Everybody had to come down to the yard and were then sorted out. All
children, elderly people and those who did not look very strong had to
stand on the left and^were then put on to trucks and taken to the prison..
Each evening they were loaded on to railway trucks and sent away.	Nothing
was ever heard of them again. A few weeks later bundles of clothes were
received at the Ghetto, and from identification papers found in the pockets
we discovered that they had belonged to the people sent away on that
particular transport. I myself saw some of these clothes and papers.
On BIEBOW's instructions the clothes were washed and mended and then
dispatched to Germany. 22,000 people were sent off on the transport.
BIEBOW then issued a special order to those left behind, telling them to
report back for work and work even harder than before, otherwise, he would
knoYf how to deal with us.
cj,	&fter that time many transports left for extermination,
always on BIEBOW's instructions, and according to the figures supplied
to me by the statistical department about 80,000 people had been sent away
by July, 1944. At that time I was still in charge of the kitchens.
10.	In July, 192[4, BIEBOW went to the different working
places and factories in the district, and told the people that the Russians
were accroaching, and that they should volunteer to go to Germany, where
they would be well treated. I myself heard several of these.speeches.
BIEBOW then ordered that the people should be rounded up.forcibly,
because there were no volunteers as everyone knew what going to Germany
meant. Whole streets were shut off by his men and then BIEBQW went
inside and rounded up the people. Whoever resisted was shot. Amongst
those phot at this time was my friend Sala ROSMSAST who was shot
because she refused to go. I was not present at this particular shooting,
but I afterwards visi^ted my friend's grave in the L©a.z cemetery.
On the.28th August, 1944, I Was myself arrested at my hiding place, .
a cellar at SULZEELDERSTRASSE 4, and taken to the station. BIEBOi*
was there supervising the loading, and counted us as we were put on to
the trucks. He had a rubber truncheon and beat people freely as they
mounted the truclcs. We arrived at AUSCHWITZ thirty-six hours later.

SUMMARY OP EXMIRATION OP ARIE HAJSCHRECK duly sworn states:-
I ara 37 years of age of Polish nationality born at LODZ, Poland.
My permanent home is LODZ, aforesaid.
I am at present living at Camp 2, Block 56, Roan, 18, HOHNE(BELSM) GAMP.
1.	As I am a Jew I was sent to the Ghetto at LODZ on 12th. March 1940.
I remained there until I was taken to AUSCHWITZ on 29th. August 1944, where
I stayed until moved to ALTH&MER on 15th. September 1944* In January 1945 ,
I was taken to DORA where I remained until moved to BELSM on 28th. March
1945 and I stayed there until the Camp was liberated by British troops.
2.	I	recognise the man shown on photograph DPS/1 as a. man I knew by	the
name	of	BIEBOW who was in charge of	the Ghetto at LODZ. I	am now told
that his name is Hanz BIEBOW.
3.	On or about 10th. August 1944 I was on duty in my capacity as policeman,
and I was standing in front of the bakery at the corner, Marynarzka and
TokarzewskLego streets in LODZ. There was a long queue in front of the
bakers shop, as people were waiting for brea<\.
4* I saw BIEBOW' s car approaching. I warned the people and they started
running away, as they were cfraid of being sent to AUSCHWITZ, if they were
caught waiting there.
5.	I	saw the car stop and BIEBOW	jumped out, a revolver	in Ms hand.
He	shot	a man who was approximately	thirty yards away from	him. I was	not-
more than ten yards away at the time and saw the whole incident clearly.
BIEBOW then turned towards me and told me that I was not to allow any
congregations to take place on the street. He then drove away. The man
who had been shot was dead and remained lying on the pavement until taken
away by the cart which usually collect the dead.
6.	There were two brothers by the name of COHU in the LODZ Ghetto. About
20th. August 1944, BIEBOv/ summoned the brothers to Ms office as it had
become known that they had passed on the story, that prisoners were not
being taken to a working place when they left the Ghetto, but to the
Gas Chambers at AUSCHAITZ. Following this I saw BIEBOW leading the
brothers to' his car and driving away in the direction of the grave-yard.
Later I saw BIEBOW return by Mmself. I have not since seen or heard
of the two men.
I certify that I duly translated the above summary to the witness in the
German language, prior to his signature which appears above.

S U M M ARY of EXAMINATION of Daniel BLITZBLAU duly
sv/om states:
I am thirty-six years of age, of Polish nationality, bom at ZD-WQLA,
Poland. My permanent home is ZD-WOLA aforesaid. I am at present living
at HLoclc IS, Camp 3, Hohne (Belsen) Camp.
1.	I was arrested for racial reasons on the 7th September, 1941
and was taken to BITCH5,’fflHDEEl.''ORS'f, where I remained for only a few days,
after which I was taken to SELGHOW. In August, 1943, I was taken to
AUSCHWITZ. On the 18th August, 1944, I ms moved to LAUBAHUTTE, where I
remained until Januaiy, 1945 • I was then taken to MAUTHAUSEN and the
following month to BSLSEN. On the 6th April, 1945, I was finally moved
to BELSEN, where I remained until liberated by British troops.
2.	I recognise the man shorn on photograph Iffi/15 as
Oberscharftthrer QUAKEEMAK, who was Carap Commandant at LAUIiMiUETTE and
HMNOVm
3,	On the 18th August, 1944, I was selected by QUAKEMAK to
be his personal barber and was consequently taken along by him to
LAUEAHUETTE. As I shaved QUAEEMAK eveiy day from then onwards, I came
to know him quite well and found that more often than not he was drunk.
At LAUEAHUETTE I saw him beat people on roll call parade daily. He
would hit them in the face with his elbows and then put on his gloves to
avoid dirtying his hands, after which he continued to beat them with his
hands. He also ordered more severe beatings to be carried out.
4.	One day a young Eussian, having been caught after an attempt
to escape, was hanged in one of the huts. All prisoners had to parade and
march through the hut three times. We were told to look at the hanging
corpse, as that was wlxat would happen to any one attempting to escape.
I, nyself, was present at the occasion and saw the corpse. QUAKEBNAK was
Camp Commandant at this time and I presume he was responsible for all this.
5.	In January, 1944, the whole camp was moved to MAUTHAUSEN.
On this occasion prisoners were loaded into cattle trucks, often up to a
hundred at a time. I saw how during the journey several people who had
died were dragged out of the trucks. Anyone attempting to peep out or
the wagons was immediately shot at and several were ohus injured,
.UAKEMMC, although in charge of this transport, was not in charge during
the short time we were in MAUTHAUSEN.
6.	We remained in MAUTHAUSEN for a few days only, and as
soon as we left, QUAKEMAK and his gang took over again. The journey
to HANNOVER was even worse than the previous one. A two-pound loaf of
bread and a piece of sausage weighing no more than four ounces was all the
food we-were given for the eight day journey, with the exception ox one
more slice on the fourth day
7,	During our whole stay in HANNOVER QUAKEKNAK was
Commandant. On several occasions I was ordered by him to take.food,
which I knew to be part of the prisoners’ rations, to various civilian
addresses - presumably of friends of his. Consequently, food was scarcer
even than before. Beatings continued and grew.even worse. When the men
returned front working parties it was a common sight to see tv, o prisoners
pushing a small trolly on which those too weak to march were piled up.
The trolly was then turned over and the prisoners were kicked and beaten
by the SS guards until they got up. Deaths occurred aaily.﻿8.
On the 6th April, 1945» we prepared to march to BELSEM.
Whilst I was in my hut packing some kit I heard a shot fired outside where
people were receiving their rations for the journey. I ran out and saw
QUAKEEMK with a pistol in his hand. I heard later that one man had been
shot. During the course of the march I saw how people who could not follow
the column were taken into a nearby wood and then a shot would be heard.
People lying on the road, left by previous columns were also taken away in the
same manner. On our arrival in HSLSEN I heard QUAKEEWAK call G-PAKEE,
the clerk, and he gave him a list of twenty-four numbers of prisoners with
instructions to strike them off the roll. I believe that Rottenftihrer HEX
was the man who carried out the shootings on QUMEENAK* s orders.

Mjt permanent home is Jagielonska Ulica 23> Cracow, Poland. I am
at present living at Block 21, Room 12, Hohne-Belsen Camp.
1.	•	i lived in Cracow until I was arrested on December
25th 1940 for work with the resistance movement. I was taken
to the Gestapo H.Q. at ALEXANDERPLATZ in Berlin. I remained
there only a short time and in January 1941 I was sent- to
BUCHENWALD and in January 1942 I was sent to SACHSENHAUSEN where
I stayed until the liberation in May 1945.
2.	Sachsenhausen was a Concentration Camp for civilians
and there were also about 12000 Russian Ps/W there. .‘/hen the
Russian armies approached Berlin there were only 1000 Russian
Ps/W left because of the terrible treatment they received and
these 1000 were removed somewhere else”.
3.	Whilst in Sachsenhausen I received a wireless set
from a Polish civilian worker and I spread the news from the B.B.C.
in London among the other prisoners. In autumn 1943 this set was
found by the SS with the result that I was sent to the Isolation
Block together with four 'of my comrades. Three of them were shot,
and the other one and I stayed in the Block for one year. Afterwar
we were put into the Punishment Block for six months.
4.	in the Isolation Block I saw among the others four
American officers, eight British officers and about 10 Russian
officers, the British and Americans were Airmen. ‘ Most of the
prisoners in the Isolation Block, including myeelfand two of the
British, were chained between the hands, but some had special
chains. These were half a yard of heavy chains between the
wrists, half a yard between’ the ankles and the two chains were
connected by an iron rod. The prisoners could only move with
short steps. These chains were worn by four of the British,
two of the Russians and about seven others, presumably Germans.
The chains were only removed on three days of the week for 15
minutes at noon and for 45 minutes of ”Sportw when we were made
to do all sorts of humiliating exercise under the direction of
SS men.
5.	One night in summer of 1944 between one and two a.m.
a squad of 20 or 30 SS men arrived under Camp Commandant Kolb,
another SS officer, who was knwwn to us by the nick name
Napoleon, and the Chief of the Crematorium. The chains were
taken off six of the British, all the Americans and Russians
and some of the Polish and French political prisoners, altogether
about 26 men. They were then marched away.
6.	Later on when I was transferred to the Punishment
Camp (S.K) I heard from men working in the Crematorium that the
Allied fliers and the bthers had been shot and cremated. I also
heard from comrades.working in the clothing store that they had
seen the fliers clothes which had been brought there.
7.	When I was sent to the Punishment Block there were
about 18 British servicemen also in the Block. I cannot say
if they were airmen or soldiers or what rank they were because
they did not wear uniform, only prison garb with the word ENGLAND
above the number. There were also two Americans in the
Punishment Block with the letters U.S.A. on their prison clothes.
The German guards often beat the older one of the two and insulted
him repeatedly for wome reason connected with the fact that he
was a consul or official in a consulate. The older American

SUMMARY of EXAMINATION of Ziytskind V/EISMAN of PCELAK9,
duly sworn states:
I am thirty-three years of age, of Polish nationality, bom at WARSA,1/,
Poland. My permanent address is: Grodzka 1, PIOTKROY, Poland. I am
at oresent living at: Holme (Belsen) Carap, Slock H» , Room 16.
X.	I	was arrested by the Germans at my home on the 20th October,
1942,	because	I	am Jewish, and was taken to PI0TKR0V Labour Gamp until
August, 1943. I was then •ansferred to	Concentration Gamp until
August, 1944, and from there was sent to AUSCHWITZ until November, 1944«
Prom there I went to GROSS R0S3I Concentration Camp, and from there in
February, 1945, was sent to FLOSSENBERG Concentration Camp for two weeks.
I was then taken to BUCHENfALL Concentration Camp for one week, and from
there to THSRESI3NSTADT Ghetto, where the Russians liberated us on the
9th May, 1945-
2.	x	have to-day been shorn a number of photographs and of such
photographs	I	recognise No 2 on photograph FC 7 as a man I know by the name
of SCHRAMM, who was S3 HauptsoharfiAhrer at BLIZYN Concentration Camp.
As far as I can recollect, he arrived there in December, 1943-
3.	He was one of the worst SS men at the Carap and -was never seen
without his heavy square whip and his big savage dog. I often saw liim oead;
prisoners brutally with this whip. I saw many people being carried to the
Camp Hospital after such beatings. I also saw him set his dog on
different prisoners on several occasions just to amuse himself. I saw tne
dog tear the clothes and bite the victims, many of whom had to be carried to
the Carap Hospital afterwards.
2^	X was working in the canvas shoe department and one. day
SCHRAMM discovered a man, whose name I cannot now remember, repairing a
woman’s shoe. He set about the man, hitting him savagely across tne x ace
with his whip, and when he had tired of tills he set Ms dog on to lum.
I saw the dog bite the man on the body and the limbs. SCHRAMM would not
allow us to take this man to the Camp Hospital despite the fact that he was
in a state of collapse.	Ye load to bring this man to the working place
every morning even though he was unable to use Ms arms and legs ..or at.
least two weeks as a result of the dog bites, and so we were compelled to
do Ills quota of vfork also.
k	j also recognise from th.e photographs mentioned above the
rnfl-n shown on photograph D^/5 as a man I knew as Unterscharftthrer G03BERG.
As far as I remember, he arrived at BLIZYN Concentration Camp ao the
end of February or early in March, 1944, as Deputy Commandant.
6.	At the end of March or early April, 1944, the Camp Commandant,
HELLER, fell sick with typhus and went away for about two months. During
that time GOSBERG
acted as Gamp Commandant
7.	Conditions at the Camp immediately became much worse.
There were severe beatings every morning during Appell. ^These were carried
out either by the SS on GOSBERG’s instructions or by GOSBERG himself,
who used a heavy whip. GOSBERjS- was never satisfied until the person so
beaten was bleeding profusely. I witnessed many such beamings.
8. I particularly remember an incident wMch occurred in about
March, 19J44, when a man had escaped. Two days later when we were all on
morning Appell GOSBERG called the BlocKLeader of that man’s block out in﻿front of the parade. GOSBERG heat the Blockleader, whose name was
TEIC'IMAN, severely, first v/ith Ms fists and then with his whip, so that
he hied profusely. TEICHMM was then carried to the Camp Hospital and
was kept there for about a week.
9.	1 was present on an occasion when a woman who had been found
with two loaves of bread was, on GOSBERG's instructions, tied to a table.
He then ordered another Unterscharftihrer whose name I do not remember, to
give her fifty strokes with a whip. At the end^ of this beating GOSBEBG
asked the woman who had given her the bread. She refused to answer, so
GOSBERG himself gave her another fifty heavy strokes with the whip.
10.	GOSBERG sometimes^ behaved abnormally, and several times
during Appell I have seen him	Ms trousers and relieve himself in
front of the parade, wMch consisted mostly of women.
I CERTIFY that I duly translated the above summary to the witness in the
GERMAN language, prior to his signature which appears above.

SUM'iARY OP EXAMINATION OP IDONIE WEISS of ROUMANIA duly sworn
states:-
I am twenty-nine years of age of Roumanian nationality, boTn
at WAC, HUNGARY. My permanent address is TARGU-MURES,
ROUMANIA. I am at present living at Room 28, Block 10,
HOHHE (BELSEN) Gamp, GERMANY.
1.	I lived at TARGU MURES until May 1944when I was
deported together with the other Jewish inhabitants of the
town to AUSCHWITZ where I stayed until the end of September
1944 and was then transferred to BELSEN Concentration Camp,
where I remained for two weeks. On 6th October 1944 I was
sent to SALZ1EDEL v/ith a transport of 800 women and I stayed
there until the liberation by the Americans. By that time
I was so weak that I had to stay in hospital for 9 weeks to
recover.
2.	I recognise the woman shown on photograph DPS/9
as an SS woman supervisor at SALZWEDEL. I am told now that
her name is Else SCHMIDT, but she was known to us by the
nickname ’’KOPASZ" which is the Hungarian word for bald -
SCHMIDT had had her hair cut off.
3.	I have often seen SCHMIDT beat prisoners most
brutally. Sometimes she beat them with a stick, although
more often she used her hands, and also kicked the prisoners.
I have seen people bleeding and others who collapsed as a
result of these beatings.
4.	On some occasions the reason would be that the
prisoners in question had spent more than the authorised
five minutes in the lavatory. At other times there was no
apparent reason at all. Even on the last days of our
captivity when the Americans were only a few miles away
SCHMIDT did not cease to beat prisoners, although many of
the other guards did.
5.	She was first employed as supervisor of the
SS kitchen, then went out with working parties. Latefr on,
when she had her hair cut off, she stayed in the Camp as
Camp supervisor. ' At that time she often came into the
Sick bay and drove out the women prisoners who went there
to obtain treatment of injuries sustained at work. On
these occasions she beat us quite indiscriminately.

duly sworn states:-
I am 32 years of age of Polish nationality bom at
BIALISTOK, POLAND. My permanent addrers is ANDRZEJA 38,
LODZ, POLAND. I am at present living at Block L.7,Room 20,
HOME (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY.
1.	I was arrested in March 1940 and taken to the
G-hetto at LODZ, where I remained until 21st August 1944 then
being sent to AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp. After three days
at AUSCHWITZ I was transferred to the WALDESLUST Labour Gamp
where I stayed until 4th February 1945 then being transferred
to BELSEN Concentration Camp where I was liberated on 15th
April 1945.
I have today been shown a number of photographs
2
and of these I recognise the man shorn on photograph DPS/1 as
a man I know by the name of HANS BIEBOW who was in charge of
the LODZ Ghetto during the whole time of my stay there.
I am a teacher by profession and, when on BIEBOY/’ s
3.
orders all schools in the Ghetto were liquidated in February
1942, I was transferred to the statistical department where
records were being kept of all new-arrivals, transports,
deaths etc.. I had access to all these figures and can
confirm that in 1942 alone 45000 people died at the Ghetto,
mostls?- as a result of starvation. 1 often had to write out
death certificates and on BIEBOW’s orders had to give ’weakness*
asthe cause of death in such cases.
4.	Our rations consisted of 0.70 litres of soup and
250 grammes of bread daily, which was of course quite in-
sufficient, especially during the cold winter months. My
duties often took me to different homes and I frequently came
across people lying there, who had literally starved. There
was nothing left of them but skin and bones.
5.	In August 1941 55000 Jews arrived from Germany and
Czechoslovakia. Their records were kept separately and in
August 1944 these records showed that not more than 1600 were
still alive. The rest had died mainly as a result of
undernourishment.
6.	The figures of 45000 dead in 1942 and a further
15000 who died subsequently until August 1944 making a total
of 60000 people who had died under BIEBOW’s rule, do not include
any of the 80000 people who were sent away in the different
transports.

SUMMARY of EXAMINATION of .Lilly KLOMPUS

I am thirty-one years of age, of LITHUANIAN nationality, horn at KAUNAS,
LITHUANIA. My permanent home is: KAUNAS, DAUKANTO, 14/4. I am. at
present living at: Oamp 3, Canteen 3*
1.	I was put into a G-hetto in LITHUANIA in August, 1941.
I was there for two years and then went to YAIYARA Camp in 33T0NIA, and
stayed there for four months. Then I was moved to ERTDA Camp (also in
ESTONIA.) Then I went to LAOEDI Oamp in July, 1944, where I stayed for
one month. We next moved to STTUTHGF Camp, near DANZIG, where we
remained for one month. In September, 1944, we were sent to OXENZGLL
which was a Camp for five hundred women.
2.	'	I was put in charge of the workers in the Ammunition
Factory in Hall 5 at OXMZOLL. There was a very cruel HauptscharfHirer
who was Commandant at OXENZOLL named HEffisUNGS (Description: age 38,
height £ feet, hair brown and straight, fair complexion, small light eyes
with red rings underneath, and medium build). On frequent occaions I saw
HENNINGS beat girls. On one occasion one of the girls was given an
apple by a German worker. She went to the hospital to give the apple
to a sick woman and was seen by jpNNTRGS.	He beat her with an iron
bar all over the body so that she fainted.	He then stood her outside
the barracks. Where she had to stay all night. Frequently during the
night he brought her back into-the barracks and beat her again. This went
on for two days and two nights. II3NMINGS was Commandant xor
approximately four months and during this time half the women were siciv
from beatings and punishments given by him.
3.	HENNHIGS’ place was taken by a Luftv/affe officer named
LAU., who was a very good man. (Description: age 42-45, height o ieet,
hair dark and straight, dark complexion, dark eyes with scar above lef u
eye, and medium build). He lives at HAMBURG, TpSuLINGSBITEL,
BIRKENKAMP 24. LAU possibly knows the whereabouts of HENNINGS.
1±.	The next Commandant was Oberscharftthrer HENZE, Adolf,
who siso beat us often. (Description: age 40, height 6 feet, hair blond
ancT straight, fair complexion, blue eyes, and big build;. He came ±rom a
Men's Ooneentration Oamp and at Appel would threaten us with the words,﻿"I have hanged twenty men before.
If you don't work harder I will hang'
you". However, he never did hang anyone.' In April, 1945> when
liberation was near, he took sixty girls from BELSEN after we had been
evacuated there from OXENZOLL, and said they had to return to work in the
munitions factory.	I know about thirty of these girls are now in SWEDEN
but I do not know v/hat happened to the others. I know HETZE is now in
custody. LAU says he is possibly in HSUENGA.lvS CIO.
c;, ..	Another guard was an S3 man named JAG-ER. (Description:
age 36 - 40, height 5 feet 10 inches, brown straight hair, medium complexion,
big build and big nose). He often struck and beat us. I rememoer three
aufsherins who beat us many times. One was called BOBBY (Description:
age 36 - 40, height 5'feet 5 inches, dark hair, large dark eyes, big figure,
long nose and fat legs). BOBBY was also in AUSCII.ITZ and RAVMSBRUCK
Concentration Camps. LAU might know her proper name.
Another aufsherin was named BOEMAOT (Description:

and a third was LONSKY (Description: age 22 - 24, height 5 feet 8 inches,

They all beat us and punished us often.

I am 37 years of age of Polish nationality born at SZYDLOWICE,,POLAND.
}fy permanent home is SKAPRZYSKO near KELCE, POLAND. I am now living at
Block 32, Room 7, HOME (BEDSEN) Gamp, GERMANY.
1.	I was arrested by the Germans at my home in August 1942
because I am a Jew and was taken to the Labour Camp at SKAERZYSKO where
I remained until April 1944. I was then transferred to CZENSTYCHOF Labour
Camp until July 1944 and from there to the GROSS ROSEN Concentration Camp
until October 1944* From there I went to NORLHAUSEN Concentration Camp
until early March 1945 and then to the DOM Concentration Camp near
NORDHAUSEN for a few weeks and in early April 1945 to BELSEN Concentration
Camp where I was liberated by the British on 15th April 1945.
2.	I recognise the man on photograph DPS/4 as one of the SS
guards at DORA Concentration Camp during the time I was there. I did not
know his name but am now told that it is ALFRED SCHMIDT.
3.	He was one of the worst guards in the camp and often beat
people very brutally. For these beatings he used a heavy stick, about the
thickness of a man's am. I witnessed many such beatings and saw how men
collapsed under the blows and had to be carried to the Revier. I was
n^yself beaten several times by this guard for no particular reason whatever.
4.	At the beginning of April 1945 I was one of the transport
from DORA to BELSEN and the guard I now recognise was in charge of our tifuck.
The journey lasted seven days and he was with us the whole time. He saw
to it that we got no food and beat up men very severely with his stick almost,
continuously. When we started off there were 130 men in the truck and at
least 50 died during the journey. I was detailed to unload the dead
whenever the i?rain stopped and that is why I am sure of that number.

SUMMARY of EX A M I N A T I 0 K of Berek GOLDSTEIN of POLAND,
duly sworn states:'
I am thirty-nine years of age, of Polish nationality,'born at WISZNICA,
POLAND. My permanent home is BELZICA, POLAND. I am at present living
at Room 12, Block 71, HOME (BELSEN) Gamp.
1,	As I am a Jew I was arrested in May, l%-3, ani taken to
BUDZIN. In July, 19^4, I was sent to LUBLIN, where I stayed until
August, 19114, when I was taken to AUSCHWITZ for three days. I was then
sent to LAURAHUETTE, where I stayed until January, 191+5, after which I
was transferred to ILTOTOVER. I remained there until February, 1945, when
I was taken to BELSEN, where I stayed until the Camp was liberated.
2.	I recognize the man shown in photograph DE/15 as the man
I knew as Oberscharffthrer QUAKSRNM who was Camp Commandant at LAURAHUETTE
and HANNOVER. I am now told that Iris name is Walter QUAKSRNAK.
3.	At the end of the Sumer of 1944 a young RUSSIAN was
recaptured after an attempt to escape. He was hung in a barrack roo ii^and
the whole Camp was made to attend the hanging, including myself. . Tills was
to set an example to deter any further attenpts toescape. ,A notice uo tnat
effect was read out on this occasion. QUAKSRNAK ordered, and was present
at this execution.
4*
On the day we left HANNOVER for BELSEN a
ROUMANIAN
prisoner stepped out of his rank just before we marched orr. I saw
QUAKSRNAK draw a revolver frcm Iris belt and shoot the man at a distance
of about two yards.	The	man fell to the ground and I	did not	see	airy
further movement from	him.	We	were then marched off	so I	do	not	know	what
happened after that.
3.	Later, on the march from HANNOVER to BELSEN, I heard
QUAKSRNAK order an SS man named REX to shoot a polish Jew. I saw REX
carry out the shooting with a machine pistol and saw the man fall to the
ground. As he had been shot at a range of about three yards, I presume _
that he was dead.	The	reason	for this shooting was	that	the Jew was	sard
to have had more than	his	ration	of bread.

SmiAEI OP EXAMINATION OP IBI POLAGSEK, of BOHIANIA, duly sworn states
I am 24 years of age of ROUi'IANIAN nationality. I was bom at TABGU-MUHES,
EOIMANIA. Hy permanent address is TAEG-U-MUEES, EOUMANIA.	present
address is Block 3, Room 18, HOME (BELSEN) Camp, GEHMANY.
I was arrested on the 25th May IJhK, and being a Jewess, was put
1.
into AUSCHV7ITZ Concentration Camp. After four months I was taken to
HELSEN where I arrived on 18th September 1944. I only stayed there for
a fortnight, at the end of which, I was transferred to SALZYffiDEL. I stayed
there until' the camp was liberated by American troops.
2.
I have today been shorn a number of photographs and of these I
recognise the woman shown 6n Photograph DE/14 as a supervisor who was at
SALZVTEDEL Camp. ’ This woman was known by the nickname "Gyongy tyuk" because
she’was’so- vain and very proud. I do not know her real name but I am now-
told that it is BERTHA SCHULTZ.
3.
SCHULTZ was onfe of the very worst supervisors in the Camp. She
was in the habit of carrying a short wooden stick with which she often
beat prisoners violently, the only reason she would forward was, that "You
are Jews, and you are responsible for this war". I often saw how prisoners
consequent to these beatings fell to the ground unconscious. I myself was
once beaten by her so violently, that I was bleeding in the face. On one
occasion she cut off the hair of a sick woman because this woman could not
do the work allocated to her. Then she beat this woman so that she was ill
for t wo weeks following this.
4.	I also recognise the woman shewn on the Photograph BPS/9 who was an
SS supervisor, first in the camp and subsequently in the factory at
SALZBEDEL. She was known by the nickname "Kopac" or "Tetves", the first
meaning that she had no hair, the latter that she was infected with lice.
Her real name was not known to me but I am now told that her name is ELSE
SCHMIDT.
5.	SCHMIDT was equalled in ^brutality only by the above named SCHULTZ.
Daily she carried out her beatings with her hand with the result that the
prisoner whom she beat wap often badly bruised and some even lost consciousness.
6.	In the factory she cut the prisoners daily soup ration to half,
for no apparent reason. 3Df prisoners fell asleep during the nightshift,
which was 14 hours long, she again beat than viciously, and also gave them
extra work to do.
7.	SCHMIDT could not bear the idea of anyone being away from wor! . -
owing to sickness,and even after prisoners had passed the German doctor- as
bing unfit for work SCHMIDT went to the sick bay and chased sick prisoners
off their beds, back to work.

1.	I was arrested by the Germans at my home in July, 1943>
because I am a Jew, and was taken to the labour camp at ELIOT- In
December, 1943, this Camp was changed into a Concentration Camp. In June,
1944, i was transferred, to the AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp until
November, 1944, and from there was sent to the Concentration Camp at
LIE3ER0SE. In February, 1945> I was sent to BACfBllTIiiUSBN Concentration

2,	I was to-day shown a number of photographs and of these
recognise No 2 on photograph FO 7 a man I know by the name of
Oberscharftthrer SCHRAMM. As far as I recollect he arrived at ^ ELIOT
in December, 1943? which was about the time the Camp was changed iiiuo a
Concentration Camp, and he remained there during the time of my stay.
3.	XHRAMM was the worst SS man in the Camp. He was always
armed with a rubber truncheon and he always had a big dog with him which he
frequently set on to people. I saw SCHRAMM beat many people who
afterwards had to be taken to the Camp Hospital. I also witnessed men and
women being attacked by SCHRAlvM’s dog, after he had set it.on to them.
They, too, were so severely injured that they had to be carried to the
Camp Hospital.
4,	One day some material was stolen from the canvas shoe
department where I was foreman. I did not know who stole the material,
but SCHRAMM came into the room the following morning and as soon as he
saw me he set his dog on to me. The dog bit me severely on the arms and
legs so that I bled profusely. SCHRAMM called the dog off and then got
hold of me and beat me brutally with his rubber truncheon. , In all hp gave
me about twenty-five strokes.
5,	One night shift SCHRAMM discovered a majj and a woman asleep.
Hp first went to the woman and beat her so savagely that her olood
splashed on the wall, which was afterwards covered with large bloodstains.
The woman collapsed under the blows and had to be taken to the Camp

XJl+j) because I am a Jew^ and was taicen to the labour camp at BLXZYL.
In December 191-3 Ihis Coimp was clianged into a Concentration Camp. In
June 1944 I was transferred to the AUSQHWITZ Concentration Camp until
November 1944 and from there was sent to the Concentration Camp at LIEBEROSi.
In Februarjr 1945 I was sent to SACIiSENHAUSEN Concentration Camp and in
March 1945 I went to MATHAUSEN. A fortnight later I was sent to EBEJfSEE
Concentration Camp where I was liberated oy the Americans on 9bh May 1945.

2m	,	in Auj;;ust 1940 a decree was published, at TCffiASZOJ,
signed ,by fe-eishapptmann VON FEEES that all Jews would have to move, into
a certain district, which would then be krjoijgi as die Qhetto. At first
jews were allowed to leave the ghetto daily.until noon but had to remain
in their quarter for the remainder of t.he day. In November 194 0 the ghetto
was cut off from the outside;world by a fence made of wooden boards. There
were two gates manned by armed German .Police Sentries and no Jew was allowed
out unless in possession of a special workman’s pass and then only if he
-was with his ^particular wqrking p^.rty. .	t,	<
*	-	'	- -	. 5.	<;
Ihe Germans who were in charge of the ghetto were
Oberleutnant GRttSER, i/c , Meister Hans PICHEER, 2nd i/c, German Police,
WENBLAKD, FUCHS, 'EEICHLER, QLSCIi, all ^embers of-the Police, V/IESE Vc
SD or Gestapo, Hauptsturmfuhrer Enrin THIEL, Sturmfuhrer BbTTICH, IvEI.iP,
• DINTSGHER, HUNGER. HAAKE, AUGUST, KSHLER, all members of the SD or Gestapo.
I remember that REICHLER’s hdme is at DtlSSELDOEF md THIEL’s at BERLIN,
Feldgartenstrasse.	,
Even at this early stage quite a number of ghetto
inmates were shot dead by one or the other of the above named Germans for
minor offences such as being found outside the ghetto, being in possession
of a piece of white bread etc.. For example in March 1941 I ''Tas told by
a-member of the Jewish Ghetto Police that KEICHLER had telephoned them
saying thkt he nad shot a woman from the Ghetto because she had been outside
the ghetto and that her body was to be collected from Jerosolinskastrasse 13,
When they arrived there they found EEICHLER and OLSCJi with the body of a
Polish Jewess and both admitted that the women had been shot. , She was
buried in the Jewish Cemetery.
People used to send their yo- ng children outside
for food and by the end of 1941 65 children had been murdered by thp a°ove
named Germans for that offence.: In December 1941 I saw a little.Polish
Jewish girl of about 4, who was found just outside the ghetto m the
Polnerstrasse carrying a satchel., murdered by one of the German Police. . I
do not know this man’s real name, only that we knew tipis man oy the mckaname
"WITZEK1*. He shot the girl at close range and when she dtill moved on .
the gsound stepped qn her throat until she was .quite dead. She was ouried
in the Jewish cemetery the following day. Also in December 19U I saw two
girls, who were about 20 years old, shot t>y BBEIIICH and KEMP in
Granicznastrasse. Each fired two shots. DINT^CHER was present too out did
not fire. I do not know why these girls were murdered; their bodies were
afterwards taken to the Jewish Cemetery by the Jewish Police and buried there.
u	In January 1942.1 was in the Granigznastrasse,
when several cars drove up. DINT SOBER, BBTTICH, KEMP, W'^SE, and AUGUST ©A
got out and they were followed by 8 or 10 poles.
X could so© ■fch&’fc ‘they *﻿the Poles, were not Jews buiT1 they were made to put on the Jewish armlets,
DIMTSCHER and BttTTIGH each got hold of a : iachine pistol and shot the
Poles. They were then taken to the Jewish cemetery by the Jewish PoliceJ^|
I was told later, by the Police, that graves had been prepared for the
bodies in advance.
^ L ^ ' ... . ,
7.	]^y March 1942 conditions in the ghetto had gone from bad to
vrorse mostly due to. the fact that there was not ^ufficieni^ food and an
average of 35 people died daily from weakness. The death rate was further
increased by Typhus, which broke out in March 1942, and an average of 25
died daily from the disease during March and April 1942. About this, time
•the average nu her of persons shot daily foaj minor offences was about 15
so an average of 75 persons were buried daily in the.Jewish cemetery. The
population of the Ghetto v/as 17,500.
8.	On the night 27/28th April ,1942 all Jewish doctors, lawyers,
factory owners, members of the Council, bakers and butchers were murdered
by the SD and German Police. They went from house to house between the
hours of 10 p.m, and 6 a.m. and those 'wanted* were called outside and shot
dead in i>ont of their homes. After the shootin, had ceased at 6 a.m,
I happened to loo’: through the window of my house and saw Ti/fifSE, KEMP,

HMKE, DINTSCHER, KEICHhEK, , BftTTICH, PTCHLER, GRbgSR and 'WITZEK* leaving
the ghetto. On my way to the office of the Jewdsh Council during the
morning I saw the dead lying in. the streets and I was present when the
Polish Policeman D0MBR0SKI was notified at the Council Office that 92 persons
had been killed during the night. I saw D0MBR0SKI strike their names off
his list of ghetto inmates. Those wardered included my friends MLJMCEEWTC,
¥ABSAGSR, ALTER, DR. JUWILER, DR.HERZ, DR..K0N, DR*BERLINER, KERSCHPRTMG, and
son, DOMATTOWICZ and wife, all of whom were Polish Jews.
9.	I was still at the Council Offipe when DINTSCHER drove up and
sent the ghetto police for ASCH, a Polish Jew, ASCH's family had been
«murdered during the night but he had been hiding. As |ie was led up
'the steps of the Council building I heard DINTSCHER say 'Huriy up I have
mot much time'. I then saw DINTSCHER shoot ASCII through the neck and
his body was immediately thrown on a truck, which had drawn up meanwhile,
which also carried the bodies of other murdered persons. These bodies
were taken to a hall at the Jewish hospital and we buried them at the
Jdwish cemetery two days .later.
10.	During a night early in May. 1942 ther was a second purge
directed against Communists and Communist sympathisers in the ghetto.
Again the Germans went from house to house and those 'wanted' were shot
on their doorstj2ps,-gOTTMJer the sho. tirfgVhad ceased I saw from the window
of my house WlsfsE, BSTTSSKR and FRANK fnom .the Criminal Police leave the
ghetto. • Sam® 25 persons were murderthe night and they were
all buried in the Jewish cemetery two days latdr. The victims included
my friends ZEGIjER and the woman BSLEER, both Polish Jews.
11.	During the next few months.lmortality amongst the ghetto
population was very high due to starvation and the daily average of those
who died from weakness rose to 40. The bodies of the people were swollen
and everyone showed signs of weakness. In October 1942 no food was issued
for a fortnight. At that time one or the other member of the SD or German
Police came into the ghetto daily to shoot different people at their homes
for no apparent reason. My ung^er}/Jo|^el LOCKIEC, a Polish Jew, v/as amongst
He was shot by B8TTCIIBR and KEMP in the presence of my
the victims.
o.unt Szajndel LOCKIEC, who related,the incident to ma afterward^.
12.	One Wednesday evening in October 1942 on our return from work
at 6 p.m. we found the ghetto brightly lit up and saw that it was surrounddd
by German and Ulcrainian sentries armed with machine pistols. We were told
to go home and remain indoors. There followed much shooting and this
continued spasmodically for three days and‘nights during which time we had﻿Exhibit "	"•

FURTHER SUMMARY OF EXAlVlIMTI ON OF Oskar LOKIEC..
1, I have been, shown a number of photographs and I have picked
out the one marked DE/5 as being the photograph of a man I know by the name
of C-OSEERG. I -am now told that his full name is Arthur GOSBERG.
2.	In December 1943 HLYZIN was converted from a working camp
into a Concentration Camp. When a few months after that HELLER, the Camp
Commandant fell ill, GOSHEEG came to deputise for him. Up to that time,
the conditions in the camp were tolerable.	With GOSHERG's arrival there
was less food, people fell ill, and the rate of deaths among prisoners rose
at a startling rate.
3.	GOSBERG did all he could to illtreat and humiliate the
prisoners. Often when on appell GOSBERG would relieve himself standing
directly in front of the women prisoners. Sometimes he would blow his nose
on to his hand and he would then call the Jewish Camp Leader ( a prisoner)
to him and he would then wipe his hand on the Camp Leader's clothes.
4.	On the morning following GOSBESG1s arrival, on roll call it
was found that there was one man short. The Jewish orderlies were told to
look for the missing man in all the huts and GOSBERG added "If the missing
man in not found, I shall have 10 of you shot". Finally the person ’was
found. It was a little boy, about 11 years of age, by the name of CUKLER
from RADOM, POLAND. The boy was bent over and beaten by Uscha BUSKE and
"another SS man with whips until-he finally collapsed. When he was carried
away I saw that he was absolutely black with bruises. I never saw the boy
again. The order for this beating was given by GOSBERG.
5.	SCHRAMM was in charge of the works and one morning after
SCHRAMM'S dog had bitten me severely, I went to the sickbay to have the
wounds treated and bandaged. GOSBERG often went to the sickbay in the
mornings and I saw him there on; this particular day. Y/hen GOSBERG saw me
he called me and took me to the dentists room. He then ordered the dentist,
a Polish Jew named Felix ROSENBAUM, to pull one of my teeth which was
perfectly healthy. ROSENBAUM had to do this without any anaesthetics.
GOSBERG then explained that this was the punishment for coming; for
treatment during working hours. He added, pointing upwards "Anyway you
will soon all go to Jehova"-,
6.	I was foreman in the workshop where slippers were made. To
stick the soles on these slippers a glue was used which had harmful effects
on the people handling it.» It was therefore an order that prisoners
handling this glue were to work two hours in the open air and then rest one
hour. It was during one of the rest periods that GOSBERG entered one day.
1 explained to him the position, he was furious and shouted that no one
was to rest, and ordered all the workers to be punished with 25 strokes. He
also said to me then "What a pity we have not go a crematorium here,.then I
would bum all these people". The beating with 25 strokes was carried out
on the same day.
7,	In the afternoon of that day GOSBERG came to the place where
we were working*. He ordered all the shift ,which numbered 73 men including
myself, to line up. Each man had to lower his trousers, step forward and
bend over a chair. GOSBERG then gave each one 25 strokes across the seat
with a leather whip. This whip had eight thongs which were plaited .........
together into one thick thong. At the conclusion of each beating GOoBERG
would give the man a kick in the seat and the next man had to step forward.
Throughout this beating GOSBERG seemed to be in a fanatical rage, his face
was red and covered with sweat. As a result of the beating which I
received, ray seat was covered with weals which turned from red to black﻿by the. same evening and in many laces my' flesh had been cut open.
Immediately after the beating we had to resume work and ne many of
us had to sit down to work we were in great pain but deppite this
we were forced to continue our work.
«
G03BEEG caught a woman, named Hania 3KLICH who came
8.
from TOMASZOW, PCLM]}, with a piece of white bread, which she had been
given by some guards for cleaning out their barracks. On appell he
called the woman out and asked her Y/here she had obtained the bread.
As guards were forbidden to give food to the prisoners she answered
that she had found it. GOSBEBl then had her tied over a bench specially
raate for beating prisoners, pulled off hen; clothes and started beating
her brutally across the seat with a heavy whip.^ After 25 strokes he
asked whether she . ould tell him where she really got the, bread from, and
when she stuck to her stoiy he gave her another 25 strokes. He repeated
this five times and then told the woman that he .would shoot her the
following day unless she told the truth. The v/oman was then untied
from the bench and she immediately collapsed. She was then carried away
by two woman prisoners. The place where I was standing on appell was
close to w here. BOSBEEG was standing and I clearly heard and saw all that
happened.

Detailed to examine the above by:- Lieut.-Col. T,H.TILLILG, E.A.,

to remain indoors without food, I nevertheless went out on two occasions
and then saw the dead bodies of a large number of Jews, who must have been
caught in the streets, lying there. There must have been between 80 and
90 Sead.
13.	At 7 a.m. on the following Saturday all Jews from one half
of the ghetto had to parade and were caken-to a square near a small church
at the Y/iecznoszstrasse. All persons in possession of labour cards were
sent into the church, from these 90 strong workers were selected to help
with the collection of x^roperty from the; empty houses. I was amongst these
and so was able to witness what ensued. I saw all members of. the SD and
the German Police take part in the action. The Jews outside the church
were made to fall in, in rows of and were then march via the Jewish hospital
to the station. Any person who fell behind was shot dead on the spot, by
members of the SD or German*Police. I did not see what happened at the station
but was told by different members of the Jewish Police.who were present, that
the Jews were made to take off their shoes and were then loaded into cattle
trucks, 120 persons to a truck which were then sealed.	The railway personnel
told the Jewish police that the train was bound for the extermination camp at
TESBLIMI. None of the Jews were ever seen or heard of again..
14.	On their return from the station the Germans (SD and Police)
went, from house to house in the streets that had been cleared and systematically
shot everyone still inside. We had to follow' them and throw the dead bodies
into the streets.	They were mostly old; and sick persons and; very young
children. An order was then issued by WIESE that the dead must be left in the
streets and that they were not bo be buried.
15.	Nothing happened on the Sunday but on the Monday morning at
7 a.m. the inhabitants of the second half of the Ghetto had ta parade. I was
still employed on clearing up work and so witnessed a repetition of
Saturdays proceedings. The only variation was that the people v ho were
marched to the station after those in possession of labour cards had been
segregated, were made to sing.- Those who- co Id not march fast enough were
again shot by the German SD and Police and the Jewish police w,ere told by the
train personnel that the transport was bound for TEEBLINKI. The Jewish
pebliee told rae that on the second occasion people not only had to leave behind
their shoes but also most of the clothes they wore and somevere completely
nakee when loaded into the cattle trucks, which were then sealed. This
transport included ry father Hirsch LOCKIEB, my mother Golda LOGKIEC and my
•three sisters Chaja, Sala and Kifka LOGKIEC, also my cousin Lonja STEINMAN,
who, though a worker, refused to be-parted from her one and a half year old
child. None of these people, all Polish Jews, were ever seen or heard of
again.
16.	After these Jews had been loaded up the Germans returned and
went to the Jewish hospital. All inmates were thrown outside and then piled
onto horse dram* carts *r*i ta3*e» to the station. According to the Jewish
police, who were present, they were then thrown into special cattle trucks
from which came a smell of chloride; these were sealed and attached to the
TBEBLIHKi train. Shoes and clothing of those sent away were then loaded on
to horse drawn carts, which we had to unload at a central point in the old
ghetto. A new small ghetto was then marked out and we had to move in. On
'TUeSdAy morning ’we,•that is•the-working party of 90 selected on the previous
Saturday, had to' go round the old ghetto and throv/ all the dead, who were still
in the houses on to the streets.
s.
17.	We were accompanied by the SD and in one of the houses in the
Krzezowastrasse, FUCHS found a trap door. When he opened this a woman named
KAUFMAN, her husband and two young children, all Polish Jews, were found. All
four were shot dead by FUCHS in rry presence and we had to throw their bodies
into the street.	....
Later an order was issued that 43 men had to report at the
18﻿Jewish cetaetcry, I was amongst those sent. Y/e were ordered to dig a large hole
whilst members of,the German Police supervised us. About an hour later horse’
carts arrived, carrying the dead. We had to unload the^, undress them otaapl^^L/ ^
and' then put them into the hole. I noticed that almost all had been shot '^^■pugh
the head' or the neck. We put 3^0 bodies into the grave, which was then
and we then had to dig another grave for the remainder, more than 100 bodies
were buried^ in the second grave. The__last body to arrive waa the oody, of a
Polish Jew named Schlama M0RTG0WICZ, the president of the Jewish^Athletic Club.
!&■ His body was bLack and blue all over as the result of beating and I noticed
^ that his fingers had been pressed quite flat. I was told by the Jewish police
that the Germans had tortured him to death, as it,had been discovered^that he
had been hiding some clothing.
19.	After his only 835 Jews: remained in the ghetto and most of these
were made to work in a newly established factory making canvas shoes for the
Wehrmacht. The clothes of the former ghetto inmates were used as raw material.
20.	In January 1943 the Sp ordered all pews who liad relatives in
Palestine to register; teey were told that they would be, sent there. The
registration had to be completed by midnight. Next morning we went to woric as
jxsual but at 11 a.m. the Jewish police came and ordered us to return to the ghetto
There we had to line up. in front of GR8SER, PICHLER, PUGHS Y/ENDLAND and two new
SS men. The names.of.the 180 Jews who had registered the evening before for
Palest ne, were called out. They were stripped of all valuables and decent
clothing,, loaded on to trucks and driven away. Nqne of them were ever soon
again and the Polish driver of the trucks told us later that they had been
taken to OJAZD and from there to the extermination centre at TREELINKI.
21.	On a Sunday in March 1943 all those still left in the ghetto
had to parade in front of GRBSER, PICHLER, PUGHS, YffiHDLAND, HYITZEKV, JIESE,
DIJiTSCHER, I1AAKE, KEMP, AUGUST, THIEL and B8TTICH. We were told that we had
to surrender all valuables and money in our possession. Two baskets had been
put there and we were told to file past them and deposit our possessions. The
first one to do so was a 18 year old Polish Jew named SAMELSON. After he had
thrown his valuables into one of the baskets KEMP shot him through the head.
The same happend to Nos. 2,3 und 4» who were Polish Jews named, respectively,
WQLCOWICZ, jPAJMAN and Chajim PLATT. All four were shot by KEMP .who said it shoull
be an example of what would happen if we failed to surrender our valuables,
22.	In March 1943 on the day of .the Jewish festival PUBIM we were
ordered to cease work at 5 P*m. At 5*30 p.pn everybody nad to parade in front
of GR0SER, PICKLER And 0LSCH. A list of 23 people were called out amongst them
DR.Mortgowicz. and son, Dr. X8NIGKEIT and wife, Hilel KOSTUTZkI ana wife and two
children, a nurse named MOETGOWICZ, HEENSTEIIT and his wife and child, Gall of
whom were Polish Jews. They were then loaded on to a^lorry and driven off.
G-R8SER,- PICHLER and 0LSCH accompanied the:.). I was told later by some Jews, thate^
they had been ordered to dig a mass grave at the cemetery and that during'the W
afternoon the 23 people-arrived together with GR0SER, PICHLER and 0L3CH. ibej
were ordered to undress, stand by the side of the newly dug hole and were then
mowed down by the three Q-ermans with machine pistols. I later saw their clothing
broughtback with the lorry that had taken'than to the cemetery.
23.	A few weeks later the remaining Jews of the TOMASZOYY gheteo
including myself were sent to the labour camp at BLIZIN.

1.	I lived in SATUMASE until 1,'larch 19^i4 when I v;as deported because
I am a Jew, I was sent to the AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp and in June
1944 I was transferred to BUCHEIfJALD. After five days at BiGHENT/ALD I
was sent to EEMSDOSP, near ZEITZ, where I had to work for a firm called
BMBAG, producing petrol from coal.
2,	I have been shown various photographs and I have picked out
the man shown on Photograph DE/7 as being the person to whom I refer in
my deposition. I am now -told his name is 'SCHlPPERS.
3.	On April 10th 1945 we left KEMSDOEB1 for TE1SZIN and on that
journey SCIIIPPERS'and Unterscharfuhrer SCHMIDT were in charge of the
transport. ./e werefon a train when there was a low level air attack,
near EEITZENHEIM,which damaged the engine and stopped the train. During
that attack about ISO prisoners, including myself, escaped.
4,	After two days I was recaptured by Volkssturm men who took me
back to REITZEHHEHu. Together with a few other recaptured men I had to
carry a dead prisoner to an open truck in the same train from which I had
escaped.. This train stood at EEITZENHElk Station and there were xour
such'1 trucks all full of corpses of prisoners all of whom appeared to have
been shot through the head. A party of about 20 prisoners had to bury
them in the afternoon in a large pit close to the station.
5,	in the evening of that day there were about 100 prisoners who
had been recaptured and we were taken to TEEEZIh. There I met many of
my comrades from HEMSDORF but there were only about 900 left of the 2400
prisoners who had started the journey. They told me that as the engine
of the train had been destroyed they had had to march to TEJEZIN. They
also told me that the sick people who had been on the train had been shot
on the spot by the SS, also those who tried to escape and had been
recaptured. " I have no doubt that it was these corpses I had seen on the
station at EEITZEHHEIM..
g..	i was also told by other prisoners that all the men. who could .
not keep the pace oh the march were shot. The prisoners received no food
whatsoever for the last five days of the eight days march. !,y comrades
told me at least 500 prisoners were shot or died of hunger on that death
march and that SCHMIDT and SCHIPPERS, whom we had nicknamed the '^Quiet one'1
were the worst and did much more of the shooting than the other SS men.

SmiMAEY OP EXAMINATION OP IEISER KOPERWAS of POLAND, duly
sworn states:-
I am 13 years of age of PO: I3H natibnality born at WOIANOW,
POLAND. My permanent address is WOLAMOW, POLAND. My
present address is HOPPEI'STSDTER Str. 1, HOME (BEISEN) Gamp
GERMANY.	pp
1.	In May 1941 I was arrested, because I am a Jew,
and taken to a Gamp at WO ANOW where I stayed forlyear then
being transferred, with some other boys, to BLIZYN. I was
sent to AIJSGH?/ITZ Goncentration Gamp at the beginning of
August 1943 and remained there until April 1944. I was then
taken to GLEIWITZ but after a week there I was sent to
NORDHAUSEN. In March 1945 I was transferred to BELSEN
Ooncentration Gamp where I was liberated by the British on
15th April 1945.
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs
and of these I recognise No.2 on Photograph No.l as a man whom
I knew as an S3 guard in BELSEN. I think he was a Roumanian
as a friend of mine who is Roumanian spoke to him in that
language. I did not know the name of this S3 guard but I
am now told that it is Theodor WAGNER.
3.	About 8 days before the liberation I witnessed the
following incident. There were a number of people on the square
by the cookhouse in Gamp 2, when suddenly I saw WAGNER appear
and pick up a spade which was lying on the ground. He
started running towards several people screaming wild curses
against the Jews and hitting out with his spade at anyone
within reach. I saw one man of about 30 years of age, who
I knew to be a Polish Jew, fall to the ground. WAGNER
continued to hit the man until he was dead. I know that the
man was dead because I saw him being carried to the mass grave
near the sick bay. The man was carried there by two prisoners
on WAGNER’s orders. However before the corpse was carried
away the Lager commandant approached and I heard him ask
WAGNER what the trouble was. I heard WAGNER say that he had
just killed a man, the commandant then walked away.
4.	quite apart from the above incident I have often
seen WAGNER beat prisoners with v/hatever he carried at the
time, sometimes it was a whip, sometimes a stick or any odd
piece of wood. Often these people were severly bruised and
bleeding after the beating. "

SUMMARY OF EXAMINATION OF Tola WBIS3MAN of POLAND,
states:-
duly sv/orn

I an 33 years of age of POLISH nationality, Lorn at PIBTRIKAU,
POLAND. My permanent home address is GRODZKA 1, PIETRIKAU,
POLAND. I am at present living at Block H 7, Room 16, HOHNE
(BELSEN) Camp, G ’.RMANY.
1.	I was arrested hy the Germans at my home in August
1942, Because I am a Jewess, and was taken to the BLIZYN
Concentration Gamp. In October 1943 I was transferred to the
ATJS0H7/ITZ Concentration Camp where I remained until January
1945, then boin, transferred to the BKLSEN Concentration Camp
where I was liberated on 15th April 1945.
2.	I have been shown various photographs and I recognise
No.2 on Photograph FC/7 as a man I know by the name of SCHRAMM,
an S3 Scharfuhrer or H: uptscharfuhrer at the BLIZYN Concentration
Gamp.
3.	SCHRAMM was one of the worst S3 men at the Camp and
was never seen without his whip and his dog. I often sanhira
beat prisoners with his whip in a brutal fashion and he never
stopped hitting until he or she had bled profusely. I saw
many'oeople being carried to the Revier after such beatings.
SCHRAMM used to amuse himself by setting his dog on to prisoners.
The animal used to tear the clothes off the victims and bite them
savagely. Many prisoners so attacked had to be taken to the
Revier afterwards.
4.	I was working in the knitting Department at BLIZYN
and from the windows there I could see the prisoners ping to
and returning from the quarry where they had to work. Sometimes
SCHRAMM was in charge of the party and I often saw him beat
different men. I particularly remember one man who was hit
repeatedly by SCHRAMM and when he was on the verge of collapse
was thrown, by SCHRAMM, against the barbed wire again and again.
He had to be carried away later.
5.	One day during February or March 1943 a man stole a
pair of stocking, from the knitting department. This action was
discovered and I overheard SCHRAMM give orders to the Ukrainians,
who were always used to execute people, that he was o be shot.
I saw the Ukrainians take the man away and heard a shot a few
minutes later. I never saw the man again.
6.	One night either at the end of 1942 or the beginning
of 1943 SCHRAMM came to our working place during the night shift
and found the woman HOPPER asleep. she had just been discharged
from the RexcLer, where she had been ill with typhus, and was still
very weak. SCHRAMM hit her with Ads whip for a very long time
and when he had tired, set Ids do" on to her. I saw the animal
bite her savagely. The woman, who bled profusely from head and
other wounds, was taken to the Sevier and I have never soon her
since.	J

^^bllKAEr OP EXAMINATION OP JAKOB JAKUBOWITZ, of POLA-ND, duly sworn states
I am 40 years of age of POLISH nationality bom at T0MASZ0ff-HA2, POLANI).
My permanent home is MOSCIEKEG-O ul.8, TOMASZOW-MAZ, POLAND. I am at
present living at Block H 7, Room 25, HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GEIMANY.
1,	I lived in T0MASZ0\f, POLAND mtil May 1943 when I was arrested
by the SS because I am a Jew.. I was taken to the Camp at BLIZIN where I
stayed until July 1944 then being transferred to AUSCHWITZ .Concentration
Camp. I stayed at AUSCHWITZ until 26th October 1944 and was then sent to
OMNI :NBURG and SACHSEHHAUSEN and in November 1944 I was smt to work at
OSDSUP, in THURINGIA. lie were evacuated to DACHAU in Larbfe 1945 but I *74-
escaped on the way and after hiding in the woods for four days I met
American tanks.
2,	I have today been shown a number of photographs and from them
I recognise No.2 on Photograph FC/7 as an SS Hauptscharfuhrer named; SCHRAMM
who via.s ii)6harge of v/orks at BLIZZN.
3,	SCHRAMM was the worst SS guard in the whole Camp. He used to
beat people every day, for no apparent reason, with a whip,the tip of
which was loaded with lead. He had a dog which often joined in an attack
on a pi’isoner. I have often seen him beat prisoners and as a result they
have fallen to the ground. The dog bit prisoners in the legs, also causing
them to fall to the ground.
Z],.	This dog acted only on SCHRAMM1 s orders. I have seen the dog
walking through the camp without attacking prisoners and can say with certainty
that he only bit prisoners when SCHRAMM either hit one or gave the dog a
command by word or by whistling. Onw prisoner from BIALYSTOK had severe
blood poisoning from the dog bites.
5.	We had to sew uniforms for the German Army and when we could
not finish the prescribed amount of work SCHRAMM took us after our 12 hours
shift to do some extra work. This consisted of shifting coal on the coal
dump, by hand.. It took from four to five hours and when he saw us getting
tired he set the dog on us which bit many of the men. He accompanied that
with remarks like "This will teach you to work faster and to carry out ,my
orders".
6.	•	Many people died in BLIZIN Camp. When I came there there were
about 4000 prisoners. When the camp was evacuated there were only about
2500 left. I saw many people being buried in the forest near to the Camp
and I think there must be abou£ 1£00 bodies there.

StMMAHY OP EXAMINATION of Ohaske LIEBKA of POLAND duly sworn
states:-
I am 17 years of age of POLISH nationality born at RIPIN,
POLAND. My permanent home address is HYMEN 5, RIPIN, POLAND.
I am now living at Block 32, Room 13, HOHNE (BELSEN) Gamp,
GERMANY.	^
1.	'^n Hay' 1^46 1 %'afe sent to the Ghetto at LODZ,
because I am a Jew and I remained there until August 1944.
I was then taken to the AUSCHWITZ Concentration Gamp and in
September 1944 to the Concentration Gamp at HANNOVER-STECKEN.
In December 1944 I was transferred to the ALEM Concentration
Gamp near HANNOVER where we were liberated on 10th April 1945
by the Americans.
2.	I have been shown various photographs and have
picked out No.7 on Photograph Z/4/3 as being a man I know by
the name of "FRED’*. He was a Capo at the ALEM Concentration
Gamp. I am. now told that his.full name is PRED GROSSE*
3.	There were 22 Capos in the Gamp, all Germans,
and ’FRED* was the worst of them. He was never to be seen
without his rubber truncheon and he frequently beat men
brutally. I often witnessed such beatings. 'FRED* never
stopped hitting a person until he bled profusely. Very often
men*beaten by him were unconscious and had to be taken to the
Revier; at other times men were beaten to death by ’FRED’ and
I saw that their bodies were thrown into the box where the dead
were always put.
4.	I remember one case in particular. We were working
in the quarry and it was bitterly cold. We were allowed to
wear a thin shirt only and one day ’FRED’ discovered that a
man, whose name I have now forgotten, had a piece of paper
under his shirt in order to keep warm. ’FRED' beat him
savagely until the man bled profusely and collapsed. He
continued to hit him with his rubber truncheon. He was still
lying quite still at the end of the shift and two prisoners
were detailed to drag the body back to camp. On our return
to camp I saw the body thrown into the box where the dead
were kept.
5.	Our breakfast ration consisted of 70 grammes of
bread. ’FRED* was supposed to issue the bread to us before
we went to work. He often kept the bread and distributed it
amongst the other Gapos.
6.	Some of the Gapos at ALEM told us that the Gamp
Commandant had issued an order stating that the Gapo who had
killed the greatest number of prisoners at the end of the war
would be decorated and admitted into the German Army as an
Officer. Every evening after Appell ’FRED* went through our
ranks and picked out	a number of prisoners at	random.	Sometimes
he chose ten, at other times 15 or	more. He	then took them to
the room which was used as a washroom and lavatory and ’amused*
himself v/ith them. The washroom attendent, a man named
SILBERBERG who was shot by the SS in April 1945, had to be in
the washroom at all times and he told me what happened every
evening. The usual	procedure was	for ’FRED*	to order	the men
to strip and he then	used to ’wash	them down’	with the	hosepipe
for tv/o*hours. ’FRED* was assisted by two more Gapos. The
water was icy cold and the men were usually dead after the two
hoxxrs. ' If there was still some life left in any of them ’FRED’
killed them either by giving them petrol injections or by
hanging them in the washroom. Every morning during Appell
I saw the dead bodies of those selected the previous evening
carried from the washhouse and thrown into a special box.
At first the black lorry of the HAHH0VER crematorium used to
come twice a week to collect the dead but later a party of﻿prisoners was

SUMMARY OP EXAMINATION OF Thea SOLE of AUSTRIA duly sworn
states:-
I am 29 years of age of Austrian nationality born at VIEN1IA,
AUSTRIA. My permanent home is ZIRKUSGASSE 27, VIMNA. I am
at pr sent living at Block 15, Room 34, HOHNE (BELSEN) Gamp.
1.	I lived in YIENNA until August 1942 when I was arrested,
because I am a Jewess, and sent to the Ghetto at THERESIENSTADT.
On the 15th May 1943 I was sent to AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp
and stayed there until July 1944 when I was transferred to
EIDELSTEDT, near HAMBURG. I was sent to the BELSEN
Concentration Camp on the 1st April 1945.
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs and
I recognise the man'shown on Photograph FC/25 as 7/alter KUMMEL
-who was the Gamp Leader' at EIDSLST1DT and who held the rank
of Unterscharfuhrer ih the SS.
3.	KUMMEL waS very brutal and I have often seen him beat
-women prisoners until they collapsed and lost consciousness.
4.	"	At EIDELSTSDT, in December 1944, I was in the Sick Bay
suffering from Diptheria when a woman named ROSZY, an
Hungarian Jewess, was brought in unconscious. She remained
unconscious for 48 hours and had to remain in the Sick Bay
for a fortnight afterwards. She told me that KUMMEL had
beaten her, at the working' site, until she collapsed. She
said the reason for this punishment was that she had accepted
food from a German civilian outside the Camp.
5.	Also while I was in the Sick Bay a Czechoslovakian
woman named Alice DUB gave birth to a baby boy at midnight
on the 22nd December 1944. The child was alive and, being
in the adjoining room, I heard it crying. The woman doctor
who attended her, a Czechoslovakian named Roszy ZIMMER, told
me the next morning that the baby had been killed and taken
away by KUMMEL, shortly after the birth, in a cardboard box.
6.	I also recognise the woman shown on Photograph PC/21
as Christel STRAUSS who was an Aufsehrin at BIDELSTEDT.
7.	I saw her in the Camp and on the working site but I
have never seen her beat or illtreat any of the prisoners
there. On the contrary I heard her, several times, ask
the other SS Aufsehrin not to beat the girls* She once told
me that she had been a nurse but she was conscripted into the
SS. When I was ill she gave me food from the' SS kitchen
which was forbidden.

SUlfliARY OP EXAMINATION OP Hannah SILBERKUHL, of 0ZSCHOSLOYAIilA
luly sworn states:-
I am 30 years of age of Czechoslovakian nationality born at
MAINZ, GERMANY. My permanent home is NARODNY TRIDA 37, PRAGUE,
CZECHOSLOVAKIA. I am at present living at Interpreters House,
Block GB 3, HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GERIMNY.
1. I lived in HAMBURG until Julsr 194S when I was arrested,
because I am a Jewess, and was sent to THERESIENSTADT where I
married a Czechoslovakian national. Prom THERESIENSTADT I was
sent to AUSCHWITZ but after 7 weeks there I was sent to work in
HAMBURG at the DESSAU-USER Camp. I worked there for 11 weeks
and was then transferred to HAMBURG-WEDEL where I stayed for
ten days then being transferred to EIDBLSTEDT. In April 1945
I was sent to BELSKN where I was liberated, by the British, on
15th April 1945.
2. Today I have been shown a number of photographs and the
man shown on Photograph PC/25 I identify as Walter KUMMEL who was
the Camp Commandant at EIDELSTEDT from the 15th AoniG 1944 until
April 1945.

3. KUMMEL started off as a strict but just Commandant. After
a few weeks he told us he had received new orders and that he had
to change his treatment of the prisoners and started beating them.
After some time he must have found pleasure in the maltreatment
and he beat the women brutally. He often boasted of the fact that
he had been a boxer ahd knew how to hit.
4.	He beat women every day on Roll call and when they paraded
for work, but these beatings were not comparible with the beatings
he gave as special punishment. On these occasions he took the
victim into an unused room next to the Sick Bay. The girl to be
beaten had to wait for a few hours at the door of the block after
her return from work. If, and when, he was in the proper mood
KUMMEL would order the girl into the room and tell her to undress
completely. He then beat her with a four edged rubber truncheon
which he called his "truth speaker". He brought this rubber truncheon
from SPALDING3TRA8SE Camp. This beating would go on for 10 minutes
or more. The girl had to stand upright and if she fell to the
ground KUMMEL would beat her still more. I have seen girls after
one' of these beatings and could see that they were covered with
red and blue weals,as he beat them indiscriminately on all oarts
of the body.
5. Oft one occasion KUMMEL beat a girl named ROSZY. I saw her
afterwards ahd she had weals on her back and a large one across her
chest and was in great pain from M;2l(w4on 5lea<3-* The next day rA
she had to go out to work ^pairingnaomb damaged houses. In the
course of the day she fainted and German Red Gross personnel brought
her back to Gamp in an ambulance. The'Red Cross personnel were
severely reprimanded by KUMMEL for doing this. He^told them that
prisoners should never be touched by anybody whether they were
medical personnel or not. The girl ROSZY was unconscious for 48 hours
afterwards. KUMMEL seemed very proud of these beatings and told
me so more than once.
6. I worked in the kitchen at EIDELSTEDT and cooked for the
SS personnel and guards. KUMMEL did not treat me badly and only
struck me ohce with his hands. On this occasion I had complained
to the SS woman guarding me that the female guards who accompanied
the prisoners to their work had called them vile names. I said that
this would give the German people a bad impression of the SS. My
guard told KUMMEL what I had said and he came into the kitchen and
struck me twice with his fist causing large bruises which I had for
a fortnight afterwards.﻿-7.	I used to visit a friend of mine named Thea SOLE who was
confined to the Sick Bay suffering from Diptheria and in the course
of my visits I became friendly with an Hungarian prisoner nsve4 GABY
who was working as a nurse in the Sick Bay. GABY told me
KUMMEL had ordered her to give a sick girl, named Bella KAtPPmH,
tablets which she believed contained Luminal. KAUFFMANH was in
hospital with Bronchitis. These pills made the girl sleep
continuously so that she could not take any nourishment and
eventually died. QABY kept "forgetting on purpose" to give
liAUFFlvIAHIT the pills but KTOIMEL noticed this and ordered S3 Aufsehrin
STRAUSS to give the pills instead.
8.	A woman named Roszy HERSGHKOVITZ worked with me in the kitchen
and about the end of November 1944 ®he gave birth to a baby boy. It
was a difficult birth and took a whole-day, but was successful.
During the day I went to the Clothing store, which was situated next
to the Sick Bay, to get some kitchen utensils, and I heard the baby
crying. HERSCHEOVITZ was in so much pain after the birth that
KUMMEL sent for a French Doctor, a prisoner in another Concentration
Camp, v/ho greatly relieved HERSCHKOVITZ. After he had finished,
KUMMEL and Sanitats Unteroffizier KEMMERICH came to the kitchen,
with the French Doctor, and I gave them all something to eat.
KEMMERICH brought with him a cardboard box, labelled margarine, but
when he	he left the box behind. He cpme back for it laterand
took it away in a car. I am certain that the box contained ®he
dead body of the baby, as KUMMEL and KEMMERICH laughingly made a
remark "This is not for cooking". KUMMEL told me later that the
child was born dead and that he had taken it away.
9.	Another woman, named Alice DUB, gave birth to a baby at
midnight on 22nd December 1944. The girls parading for work early
the next morning could hear the baby crying as the parade ground ?;as
in front of the Sick Bay. KUMMEL and STRAUSS came into my-kitchen
about 11 oclock and they were both rather excited. STRAUSS washed
her hands very thoroughly and KUMMEL looked very green in the face.
STRAUSS told me then that the baby had been born dead.
10.	I also recognise the woman shown on Photograph FC/21 as
being S3 Aufsehrin Christel STRAUSS who was at first a guard in
the kitchen and later worked in the Sick Bay at EIDELSTEDT.
11. I have never seen her beating or maltreating prisoners. The
only incidents in which I know her to be involved are (a) Giving the
tablets to Bella KAUFFMAUN on the orders of KUMMEL and (B) It was her
duty to be present at the birth of both Roszy HERSCHKOVTTZ’s and
Alice DUBrs babies so she must have been a party to the killing of them.
Just before we left for BELSEN she was transferred to a working
party, onKUMMEL’s orders.

I am 25 years of age and of Polish nationality, bom at LODZ, POLAND.
Iviy permanent address is GDANSKA 31, Hoorn 14, LODZ. I am at present
living at Block 35, Room. 20, HOHNE (BELSM) Camp, GEIMANY.
1.	In Maxell 1940 I was arrested, because I am a Jew, and sent to
the GhetbO in LODZ, where I stayed until I was transferred to CZEHSTOCHAO,
a labour camp in Poland, on the 3rd March 1944. In September 1944 I
was sent to BUCHEN'vfALD and in October 1944 was taken to a Labour Camp at
SGNNENBERG-. When the Americans approached in April 1945 we were evacuated
and spent the next four weeks on the road. Finally, on the. 7th May 1945
we were liberal d by American troops in the Sudetenland.
2.	I have been shown various photographs and I have picked out the
one marked DPS/l as being a man I knew at LODZ named BIEBOW. I am now told
that liis full name is Hans BIEBOV.
3.	During the whole of nay stay at the Ghetto in LODZ, HEEBOW vra.s
Commandant. ' In July or August of 1942 BIEBOW ordered all children up
to tie age of 12 and all adults who were unfit for work, to assemble at a
hospital in the Ghetto. To ensure that nobody escaped this parade he
himself went from house to house accompanied by Gestapo Officials, and
made all' inhaoitants parade in front of their houses. The.persons who
were selected were loaded on lorries, and on BIEBOW1s orders all ghetto
police, fire brigade, and postmen had to assist seeing tnat noone
attempted to jump off these lorries. I vdtne^sed about nine thousand
children and sick people, ragny of them selected personally by BIEBOW, crowded
on lorries and sent away. None of these people have been seen or heard
of since.
4.	During this selection a man approached BIEBOW to plead for his
only son not to be taken away. I was standing 10 yards from them and saw
BIEBOW draw his pistol and shoot the man. The man fell to the ground aid.
I never saw him again.
5.	After 1942 selections became frequent and every few weeks those
too old or ill to work were selected by BIEBOW and sent away. It was
not known where these people went to and BIEBOW never forwarded any
explanation.

RTTMMABT OP EXAMINATION OP Margit ROSENTHAL of GERMANY, duly
sworn states:-
I am 18 years of age and of GERMAN nationality horn at BERLIN.
My permanent address is WEISSENBURGER 3TRASSE 72, BERLIN, N.E.
I am at present living in Block 11, Room 18, HOME (BELSBN)
Gamp, GERMANY.
1.	i was arrested by the Germans on 7th January 1944,
because I am a Jewess, and was sent to THERESIENSTADT. I
stayed there until the beginning of May 1944 then being sent
to AUSCHWITZ where I stayed until the beginning of August 1944
when I was transferred to DESSAUER UPER. In November 1944
I was moved to NEUGRABEN and in February 1945 to TIEFSTEGK.
At the end of March 1945 I was sent to BELSEN and I stayed
there until the Gamp was liberated by British troops.
2.	Today I have been shown various photographs and
I recognise the woman shown as No.4 on Photograph No.35 as
an SS guard at BELSEN, I knew by the name of Anneliese KOHLMANN.
3.	I first saw KOHLMANN at NEUGRABEN where she was
an SS supervisor, in charge of outside working parties. I
have worked in her parties quite some time and her general
behaviour led me to suspect that she had perverted sexual
tendencies. She showed certain preferences for younger
girls but brutally ill-treated the elder women. When with the
working warty she carried a stick and did not permit anyone
to rest.~ Sometimes she hit prisoners violently and I myself
have witnessed how she beat an elderly Czech woman until she
lost consciousness. If she liked a particular young girl
she favoured her in every way possible and whatever she took
from other prisoners she gave to her.	When I was transferred
to TIEFSTECK, KOHLMANN was there too, still as an SS supervisor.
4.	At the end of March 1945 when we v/ere moved to
BELSEN, KOHLMANN was one of the guards in charge of the transport.
On the arrival at BELSEN the guards handed us over, and to the
best of my knowledge they then returned to TIBFSTECK. A day
or two later I saw KOHLMANN sitting outside our hut in the
strioed suit of a prisoner. She explained that she had got
the clothes from a prisoner who had escaped. She told us
that sher was going to be a prisoner herself.

PUETEER SmiAEY; OP EXMGEATION OP Leo PATSCHORKOVSKI, of POLAND, duly
sworn states
I am 35 years of age of Polish nationality, bom at LODZ. My permanent home
is PQLODNJOVA ULICA 28, LODZ. I am at present living at Stuttgart ,
Reinsburgstrasse I89, GERMANY.
1.
I joined the Polish Army in March 1939« I was wounded
in the foot on September 18th 1939* In October,1939} after Germany had
over-run POLAND and I came out of the hospital, I was sent to a Prisoner of
War Camp near WARSAW, where I stayed for about five weeks. In December
1939 I was sent to a Prisonersof War Camp at CZENSTOCHAU. I escaped from
there after about ten days and returned to LODZ. At the end of March 1940
I had to move into the Ghetto, where I worked in a furniture factory for
the Germans. I was sent to SACHSENHA.USEN on the 21st October 1944 and stayed
there until November 6th 1944. I was then sent to KKnigswusterhausen, which
is about 25 kilometres from BERLIN. I worked there as a joiner- until the
18th April 1945 when I was sent back to SACHSENHAUSEN because of the advance
of the Russians. After two days SACHSENHAUSEN was evacuated and we were
marched North-Westv/ards in a large column. On the 3rd May 1945 the guards
drove us into a wood at GRABOW, near LUDWIGSLUST, and then ran off, because
the Russians were only one kilometre away and the British six kilometres.
2.	Today I was taken to the Belsen Detention Cells and I was
shown a number of persons and I picked out a man whom I know as Franz SEIFERT.
I was under him in LODZ Ghetto and in a Camp in KONIGSTfUSTEHHAUSEN.
3.	In both places this man SEIFERT often beat prisoners vsrhen
he came to inspect.our work. Amongst others he has beaten and kicked my
brother David PATSCHOHKOVSKI.
4.	I	In K(MEGSWUSTERHAUSEN in February 1945 I heard him set upon
a fellow prisoner called David FEI13ER in the adjoining workshop because FEIMER
had washed in water which he had obtained without permission. SEIFERT beat
FEII’IER for 3 or 4 minutes and when he left I and a colleague went to help
FEINER whom we found bleeding profusely from the nose.
5.	Thse are the only two instances in vdiich I remember the names
of the victims but similar beatings took place almost daily. SEIFERT
definitely was very much Beared in the Ghetto in LODZ.

I am thirty-five years of age, of Polish nationality, horn at LODZ.
POLODMJOVA PLICA 28, LODZ, is my permanent home. I am at present
living at Stuttgart Reinsburgstrass e 189, Germany.
1.	I joined the Polish Army in March, 1939- I was 'wounded

over-run POLAND and I came out of the hospital, I was sent to a Prisoner

October, 1944, ar.d stayed there until November 6th, 1944* I was. then sent
to Kdnigswusterhausen, which is about twenty-five kilometres from BURL IN.
I worked there as a joiner until the 18th April, 1945, when I was sent back
to SAOHSENHAUSEN Concentration Camp because of the advance of the Russians.
After two days SACHSBNHAUSM was evacuated, and we were marched North-
Westwards in a large column. On the 3I'(3. May, 1945, the guards drove us
into a wood at GRABOW, near LUDWIG3LUST, and then ran off, because the
Russians were only one kilometre away and the British six kilometres.
2.	Today I have been shown several photographs, and I
recognise No. DPS 1 as II ans BfJBOW, whose real name I am told is BUBOW.
3.	BIEBOW was chief of the Jewish Ghetto at LODZ, and had
control of all imates. Not even high ranking German Police Officers
could make any arrangements without BIEBOW1 s consent. BIEBOW was
Aatsleiter at the Ghetto.
4.	There was a "resettlement drive" in September, 1942. I was
in the same house with my brother David PATSCHORKOVSKI in LODZ when
BIEBOW called with a Gestapo officer named FUCHS and four or five SS men.
They broke open the door and entered our room. My brother had quickly
hidden his six-year old daughter in a wardrobe, but BIEBOW, pistol in
hand., searched the room for old and sick people and children. He shouoea,
"Tliis must not be a Ghetto for old and sick. This has to be a working
camp". He found my niece in the wardrobe and dragged her away to a
waiting lorry in which there were already many children. He wanted uo
take my brother also, for attempting to shield nis child, but my brother
managed to escape on the staircase. I have never seen tne child again
and until this day do not know what happened to her. Of all the 18,000
people who were taken away in that drive, nobody has been seen again.
5.	A few days after this I went to a distribution point for
potatoes, but found that owing to the one -week's curfew the men on duty
there were not allowed to issue any. There was a queue tnere.. iu ter
I had been there for about fifteen minutes suddenly a car came into the
street with BIEBOW in it, accompanied by two 33 officers, FUCHS, and
SCHMIDT. They jumped out of the car and all three fired their pistols
into the queue. I escaped, and looking out of the window oi tne house
into which I had fled could see about three bodies from where I stood.
I do not know how many were hit altogether.
g.	During the time of the above mentioned drive gallows were
erected and two people were hung. X do not know the reason for this.
yt	TMs "resettlement drive" was carried out in some streets
like a selection. I saw how my step-mother was selected as unfit.﻿or
- 2 -
I went to warn my father and to save the nine-year old son of my sister.
When Gestapo officer PUGHS came to that house he made everybody parade
in the hack yard and there he picked out the people he considered unfit
for work. Among them was my stepmother.
8.	A few days before that drive BIEBOW orclorcd -all the—
hospitals-to ke-eloarod and he- drove up with the Roll Kommando (Plying
Squad), loaded, all the patients on to the lorries, and the people were
never seen again. I saw the scene myself, as I was working as a
carpenter on a 'building site nearby. I tried to save an acquaintance
of mine who had the presence of mind to put on a nurse's apron and walked^,
towards us. However, BISBOY/ recognised her disguise end ordered and ^L
ortiered an SS man to put her on a lorry.

9.	BZEBOW made a speech to us all the day before the
dissolution of the Ghetto, saying that nothing bad would happen to the
people who were being sent on the transports, but that they would go to
Germany to work. He said this although he must have had his orders from
higher up at that time and must have known what he had to do to the Jews*
1,’myself, escaped the fate of the others because I was in a party of
250 men and 300 women who, under the direction qf SEIPERT, BIEBOW's
assistant, had to remove machinery for woodwork to Germany. The men of
our party of 250 afterwards went to SACHSHNHAUSM, and\ the women went to
RAVEMSBRUCK. At SACHSMHAUS3N we received Concentration Gamp clothing.
All the 250 men and 70 of the women later on came to a firm called
3TENYERS and KfiLTSBORlT in KONIGS.’IUSTERHAUSM.
10.	During the final clearing of the Ghetto in September, 19'44,
1 once saw how the sick people - about 200 - were dragged out of a house
by, SS men under the command of BIEBOVv, PUGHS and SGIKTHD.	They.were
thrown on tram cars - most of them naked - and X saw the tramcars driven
away.
11.
I would describe the Gestapo officers as follows:
PUGHS is about thirty years of age, height about 5 feet
nine inches,’ slim build, and dark blond hair.
SEIFERT is about A5 years of age, height 5 feet 4 inches,
hair fair and bald on top, wears glasses and has an oblong narrow x aoe.
SCffivTND is about 45 years of age, height 5 f(eet 6 inches,

1.	I lived in VISU until 27th May 1944 when I was arrested
by Hungarian police because I am a Jew. I was takentto KOSICE and when
the SS took over I was sent to AUSCHWITZ Concentration Carap. I arrived
at AUSCHWITZ on June 1st but after two weeks there I was transferred to
LAGISA where I stayed for three months. In October 194-4 I was taken to
JAWOSNA and I had to work in the coal mines until I was sent to HjECKBAMLIER

2.	Today I have been shown a number of photographs and I
recognise the one marked No.2. on Photograph FC/2 as the man to whom I
refer in this deposition. I am now told his name is Fritz T,ACKER.
3.	Fritz WAGNER was an SS guard who was in charge of my
working party at MUHLDORF. This working party had to clear up air raid
damage on the station. He often beat prisoners with the butt of his
rifl<5, often resulting in wounds and bruises and unconsciousness. I 2:now
of at least three cases where the beatings resulted in death. I know that
the three prisoners were dead, because a special "dead commando" came and
took off the prisoners clothes and wrapped the bodies in paper. I saw the
bodies again, as it was an order that even dead bodies had to appear on
roll-call* After that they were buried.
4.	One day when we were at the working site WAGNER caught
two men attempting to steal a potato. To punish them he fixed a rope around
their chests just below the armpits, and hung them up for fifteen minutes.
When he cut them do.n the mens faces were white and drawn and they had lost
consciousness. They were taken to hospital and I never saw them again.
¥AGMER>3 maltreatment was so brutal that it drew remarks from other SS guards
to whom I heard him say "These Jews are not worth the air they are breathing".

picked out one marked DPS/l, as being a man named BIEBOW who was in charge
of the LODZ Ghetto during my stay there. I am now told that his full name
is Hans BIEBOW.
5.	Terrible things happened in the LODZ Ghetto under BI$B0W*s
rule, I remember one particular incident I witnessed. In September 1942
BIEBOW ordered that a transport should be made up for extermination. He
ordered that nobody must leave their houses for one week and then with his
staff went round and selected different people. One day during that week
about midday I ms standing in the doorway of the house Piewna 20, only
10 metres from the spot outside the hospital where BIEBOW ms again starting
out people, ■ The woman living in the house .next to mine, her name
was PQDEMSKI, was amonst those selected by BIEBOW, Her son, a lad of 17
years saw his mother being picked out and rushed across the road to BIEBOW
to plead for his mother's life. I heard BIEBOW shout at him 'how old
are you'. The boy replied 'I am only 17 years old'. BIEBOW then shouted
back 'In that case you have lived long enought' and shot him through the
chest. I saw the boy collapse at once and he did not move again. BIEBOW
then kicked him awa3r from where he was standing.
4.	During the whole day BIEBOW was sorting out people outside
the hospital which was opposite ray house, and he carried a pistol in aach
hand. Whenever anybody approached him hat immediately shot him or her down.
When BIEBOW' eventually left,about ’our o'clock in the afternoon, I counted
more than 15 dead, bodies

SUl',i AET OP IXMIIIATION OP Sclimulek -HAMWSTEIN,OP POLAZID, duly sworn states:-
I am 22 years of age of Polish;nationality born at KIELCE, PGCAED. Jfjr
permanent address is' JZDSKA 24, LODZ, POL/J®. I am now living at Block 38,
Room 30, HOHNE (lELBM) ’Camp, G-EH.ABT, but I .arm at present detained at the
GLYi! nL’GHES Hospital jTfard 3 A, Room 81, HOifNE (BELSEN) Camp, .-'GSKfvIAI.ff.
1.	^	In April 1940 I was tajlcen to the LODZ Ghetto
(G-ran$tstrasse 24) because Iham a Jew. In August,1944 I was sent to
AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp and 10 days later to the HiUPTOtER-STECpiI
Concentration Camp and in early December 1944 to the AHLEM Concentration
Camp near HASHOVER.	In early April 1945 I was transferred .to the BELSEP •
Concentratdori Camp' "where I .was liberated on 15th April 1945*
2.	On 17th December 1945 I was tak-en to the BELSEH
DETENTION CELLS where I was shown five men. I picked out one who,is the
person referred to in"my deposition as 'FRED*. I'have also been shown a
number of photographs and. have picked out No.7 on Photograph Z/4/3; as also
'being this man.- . He was a Capo at HAkNOVER-STECKEN and .principal Capo at
.AHLEM.- I am now told that his full name: is Ferdinand GR0S§E.
3.	Immediately on our arrival at HAI^NCVER-STECKllL
fror.* AUSCIY/ITZ, dPRED’ made ,us take off our boots, which he took away.
Later we were issued with other boots that had bpn condenned^and afforded
us practically no protection from the wet and cold. .
I saw 'FRED1 on many occasions beat men to death.
He used either a rubber truncheon or a heavy piece of wood and seldom
stopped hitting a man before he was certain that he was dead. The bodies
of these men were throw into a special hut, or later on dumped on.to a
heap inside the camp, awaiting .disposal. 'FRED' Would kill a nan for any
minor offence such as being' five.- minutes late for. Parade,, falling behind when
we marched to or from work. He.also killed all those v/ho became weak and
could not work so hard.
5.	Quite often I witnessed men murdered by him during
the march back from the CONTINENTAL Rubber factory at HANITOVER-STECmi,
where we worked, to the Camp. T.re were' them detailed to carry tne bodies
back to Camp, either on the ladders we-had with us or on boards. Back at
the camp they were dumped either into the •deathhuf or on to the 'death heap
g, ■	’FEED’ quite often confiscated our .meagre'rations
and. I- saw him sell them to die civilians who were working near us.
7,	In early December 1944 ‘FRED1 accompanied our
transport to ALLEN. ■ There he was even worse and there was not a day when
he did not kill men. At AHLEM I was in the Koronando that worked in the
stone mine. 0»e.day in January 1945, or, return from work, I was; told that
my brother Chemia BLIMENSTEIN was very sick, I went to see him and found
him in a terrible:condition.. He was spitting blood and his body was
terribly bruised.- He tbld rae that he had been beaten by 'FRED1, iiy brother
died 8 days later.
I?
8.	I was detailed to work in the Revier at AHLEM
and eweiy day bodies of men, who were either already dead or on the point
of dying from the terrible beatings they had received, were brought into
the Revier. Some were able to tell me before they passed away, that it
was ’FEED* who had beaten them. The dead were either collected by a lorry﻿■f s, \'
from the HAM'IOVER crematorium or buried in a wood near the camp.
#
sed
Every evening after Appell 'PEED1 used to
call out a number of raan and they were then tqken to a hut which ms usee
as a* wash-house and lavatory. The attendant there;, a, Jew foy; the name of
•SILBEIiBEHG■ who was murdered latei;, tol^' me that every evening, under 'FEED'S'
"Sirectidn, these men were either ''washed-dom' with the; hose in icy cold
weiter- until they were dead, or ,el'se they.'were .beaten:to death by PEED, who
was assisted by other Capos. SILBEEHERG told me that no killing ever took
place unless PEED was present. Sometimes men managed to survive the terrible
beatings but they Were then-'fihished off. .by SEED who either gave theiS an
injection or-hung-them in the wash-house. ' During the time I was; working
at the'E.evier we had to go to the-wash-house 'every morning; to'/collect the
dead. 'At times there were 10 or more bedids. I could see:that some had
been beaten to-death-, others'hung-,: and others again,whose naked bodies were
still wet;-had been murde-red with-the-;-hose. We carried the. bodies outside and
dumped them into the box.
10.	■ Many times PEED came ;into the -Revier at £BLMl
between 11 and 12 o'clock at night and:.ask for the Syringe. A few-minutes
later I would hear terrible cries from the waiting roomand on -going there
would-find-'several men in terrible agony. They were in horrible convulsions
for about 15'minutes'before'they-died. Thebe; was .nothing I could dq to
relieve their agony.
•'ll,	-	One night in March'1945's .at-AHElM, a man was
brought, unconscious, into the Revier and I could see that he had had a
terrible beating. -•- When I-nvashed .the dried blood off his. face the- next
morning I recognised my brother, Moschek ELUIvENSTEIN, who had been fit and
well they day before. When he came round he told me that PEED had beaten
him.- Ey brother died about 10 daVs later.

our transport consisted of more than 1000 men. Considerably les-- tnen 100

Sljl-E L&EY OF ESMOTATIOi: OF itealie tERKEDKB of GEHM'JY, duly sworn states:-
I am 33 yaars of age of German nationality born at BEMilN-bTSlSSMSEE.
My permanent address is BAHNHOFSTMASSE 88, MMCHEN, GEHMAKI. I am now
living at Block EB 1, Room 8 , EOHNS (BEL Sill) Caisrp, GEE-IAITT.
1.	I was arrested by the Nazis at ny Hone on 7th March
1943	jbecause I 'am a Gipsy,and was-sent to AUSCffll/ITZ-BIISCElTAU. In August
1944	I was transferred to the Isolation Camp (Quarantine) AUSCITiVITZ, where
I remained until October 1944.when I was sent to the I^YEHSBROCK Concentration
Camp. On 28th March 1945 I was taken to the MLSEfT Concentration Gamp
where I was liberated on lyt’ April 19/.3,
2.	I have today been shorn a number of photographs
arid from these have picked No.l on Photograph FC/4 as. being a nan I know
by the nane of SSHfARZHUBER. He was Deputy Camp Commandant of the
AUSCrriJITZ-BIiltMfAU Camp and I also saw him later at RAVENSBRUCE.
3.	’ At AUSCHilTZ-BIEKENAU 1 vr&s employed as a nurse
at the Revier. I was frequently on night duty and nearly every night
between midnight and '2 o’clock in the morning SCffilARZEUBER came to the
Sevier, carrying a pistol in one hand and a heavy walking stick in the
other. He went into the rooms where the nurses slept and there he
raped whoever pleased him. He was nearly always drunk when he came in
and usually stayed for one or two hours. During one of his nightly visits
in May 1943, he came up to me, gave me a cigarette and told me that he
would send a sentry to take me to his quarters as he wanted to sleep with
me. YJhen the sentry came for me about half an hour later, I refused to
go. The following night SCHS7ABZHUEB3 came up to me and asked why I had,
not come• I told him that I was married and that my husband was at
AUSCHWITZ. He then shouted "You are a prisoner and as such have no rights
but must do what I say", and beat me severely with his heavy stick. My
back bled a lot and I collapsed. SCHNARZHUBER then told me to get up but
I was unable to do so. He then kicked me with his heavy boots all over
my body. I was confined to bed for six weeks after the beating.
4.	When I was not on night duty I slept with my husband
in Block 4. SCMAHZHUBER would, often come into our Block at night and make
the married women get up from the beds they shared with their husbands.
They then had to strip completely and,in full view*of their husbands v^ere
made to dance before SCHIARZHUBER. He_then would pick out the one who
was best looking and take her into the room of the Blockleader for immoral
purposes.
5.	One night , in early May 1943 SCHWASZHUBER came into
the Revier round about 1 o'clock. I was on duty at the childrens ward.
The children were veiy restless and some cried. Two little boys of about
4 were sitting on a chamber relieving themselves and they started to cary
too as SCHYABZHUBER came in. I saw him go up to them shouting 'You ........
brats, you should not be alive' and hit them savagely with his heavy
walking stick over the head. Their heads split wide open and they both
died instantaneously. SOfflARZHUBER then ordered me to pick up the dead
bodies and carry them to the death hall at the Revier, which I did,so
He also told me that I must not mention/the fact that he had killed the
children to anyone.

1.	I was arrested by the Germans in May 1942, because
I aia a Jew, and was tak®n to the Ghetto in LODZ. In Augusv IgtA 1 was
transferred to AUSCHWITZ Concentration.Camp where X stayed until September
1944 then being sent to HOTOVER-STECKM. In November 1944 I was sent
to HAHNdTER-AH&^M and on the,Vth April 1945 I was taken to BELSEU Concentration
.C&np where I was liberated on.the. Igth April 1945*
...2»	I have been shown a number of photographs: and I .
picked out the ;nan shown as No.7 on Photograph Z/4/3 as & nan I knew by
the name of PEED. I hayc since been shown sir persons at the EELSEL
DETENTION CELLS, and I have identified the one I knew by the name of BRED.
I am now told that his full name is Ferdinand GROSSS.
e, • ■ ■
3.	At HAIvW^ER-STECKEIT, FEED was at first Blockleader
and later a Capo. As Blpckleader he used to select 20 or 50 men after
u every Appell and they were then ordered by him to do ’sports’. Tney had
to, ran round the. Appell Square, -throw themselves on the ground, crawl on
fhe ground and during the exercise FRED used to oeat them continuously
witb his heavy rubber truncheon. I saw many of the men collapse during
these exercises and most of them bled from wounds caused by the oeating*
Often men illtreated in this rsAnner had to be carried to the Revier
afterwards, and some ’'of these were never seen again by me. The many people
murdered by FRED at STECEEN included my friends Berich SEIDE, Gidale
STADTLANDER and Simcha EOPLOYlICZ, all of them Polish Jews.
4,	I saw GROSSE at AHLBi where he was a blockleader.
Every morning when working parties got ready to leave the Camp, GROSSE
stood at the gate. There were always some men too weak to work, who
collapsed. These men GEOSSE then took to the washroom, I did not see
what he did to the prisoners in there, but I later saw the dead bodies
of these men thrown into a box, where all corpses were placed. I was
told by Jacob GELBAROWITZ, a barber at the Camp, that he hung the
prisoners in the wasliroom.
5#	GROSSE often took'prisoners to the Revier and again
the corpses of these prisoners were later taken away, I have been told
by Schmul BLTMENSTEIN, who worked in the Revier, that GROSSE gave these
men petrol-injections.
g.	It was a common sight to see GROSSE BS&ting
prisoner^ in the court-yard using a rubber truncheon or an iron bar.
Many died as' a result of these beatings. I have seen him kill prisoners
with a soup laddie because they did not hold their raess tins straight when
GROSSE was dishing out the meal. Hardly a day passed without GROSbE
killing some' prisoners. Of a total of over a thousand who arrived﻿4

R.e.c,
1,	1 was arrested by the Germans at my home in January 1940,
because I am Jewish, and was taken to the Ghetto at WOLANOV with my parents
who were later killed by the Germans.	In January 1941 I was t^cen to the
Labour Camp at WOLANOV and at this Camp I was sent out to work as a farm hand,
I remained there until May 1943 when I was sent to the HLIZIN Concentration
Camp. In August 1944 I was taken to the AUSCHUTZ Concentration Camp
and from there, in January 1945 to the GLEIV/TTZ Concentration Camp and one
week later to the DORA Concentration Camp near NOHDHAUSEN. In early April
1945 I was sent to the BEL SEN Concentration Camp where I was liberated by
the British on 15th April 1945.
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs and of the
persons shown on these photographs I recognise No.2 on Photograph 1 as an
SS man who was at the BELSM Cor^centration Camp at the same time as myself..
I did not know his name but I am now told that it is THEODOR WAGNER.
About a week before we were liberated I and another three boys
were standing near the kitchen near Block 87 in Camp 2 at BELSEN. I saw a
group of about 8 prisoners standing near the kitchen about 15 metres from
where we were and suddenly WAGNER came out of the kitchen, picked up a spade
and began to hit the men. The men all ran away except one, who was about
30 years old, who fell to the ground. The SS man continued to hit the man
with the spade as hard as he could. After :he SS man had stopped hitting
the man he was lying quite still on the ground and I could see that half his
face had been smashed in.	I then saw the SS men call two prisoners and they
took the body to one of the pits where the, dead were ahrays put. Just at
that time the Commandant of BELSEN Camp 2, who was an Hauptsturmfuhrer as far
as I can remember, arrived on the scene. I overheard the SS man tell him
that he load killed a man. .VAGNER was smoking at the time and laughing as
he told this to the Camp Commandant.
4.	I saw WAGNER again two or three days after our liberation.
He was outside the temporary Revier in Camp 2 with a Red Cross car carrying
straw sacks under the supervision of the British and he then told me,in German,
that he was a Roumanian. He also spoke to some Roumanian ex-prisoners in
a language I did not understand.

3.	I often witnessed HEIDEMMN severely beat women. He did
so with a heavy piece of wood or whatever he could lay his hands on. Every
morning he came into our Block and selected women for work. if they aid
not get up immediately he would hit them savagely and order the whole Block
to stand to attention outside for several hours, regardless of weather
conditions. On such days he ordered that we were to receive no food for
24 hours.
4.	In December 1944 the inmates of my tent, all women, were
moved into a Block. We rushed in tosecure, ourselves a decent bunk and
HEUnSMANN who was waiting for us inside started to beat us. He got hold
of me, because I was too weak to climb up to one of the upper bunks,and
began to hit me savagely with a heavy piece of wood. I soon lost
consciousness and when I came round, some time later, I was unable to
move my left arm, which ms bruised and swollen. It was three weeks
before I could use my arm again.

﻿SUMMARY OR EXAl'IUT^TION OP Michael LEtCBERG-ER of POUy1®, duly sworn states: -
I am 221 years of age and of Polish nationality horn at Lodz, Poland.
My permanent home address is ALEA 1st MAY 7, LODZ, PolahcL: I On at present
living at G-lyn Hughes Hospital, Block A3, Room 81, H0ME’(BiLS'si'f) CAMP,Germany.
1»	-In. April 1940 I vrasdarrested because d IE am a Jew, and'was
sent to the Ghetto at Lodz* where X remained until August 194L, .'when51 ms
sent to AUBCHYITZ Concentration Camp. In September 1944 1 was transferred to
HAHOVER- .SQJECKJSN .and in December 1944 to MHOVHR-AHLHM Y/here I v/as liberated
by American Troops.
2.	On 17tli. December 1945, I; wasGtaken to' the Belsen Detention
C3Ls where I was shown five men. I picked out one who is the person referred
to in my deposition as FRED. I have also been shown a number of photographs
and have pifeked out No. 7 on Photo Z/k/3 as also being this man. He was a
Capo at HAIICATSR-STECKEN and principal Capo at AHLM. I am now told that his
full name is FERDINAND GROSSE.
3.	At AHLEM ’FRED* often came round the Camp, and v/hen a
prisoner caught his eye ’FRED* would say to him "Come on you. you need a wash.1
He then took the selected prisoners into the wash house and all I saw was
that, later some, of these prisoners; wexys carried out dead and thrown into a
•a box, where bodies were,.put, awaiting disposal. I have been told by a man
named SJL33RBSR(j, v/lxo, I believe, was murdered later, and who was an eye
witness to the happenings in the wash house, that ’FRED* washed down these
prisoners with a hose pipe with icy water until they were dead, I know
the name of one of the men who was killed in the wash house to be GOTHSINER
a Polish Jew, with whom I worked in the Ghetto at LODZ.
4-.	I was working in the mine at AHLM and 'FRED1 was there as
well. When he thought that I did not work hard enough he took the handle of a
shovel and beat me furiously, causing wounds, the marts of which I bear to
this day. One day he ordered me to push a heavily loaded tipper on rails
* up a little slope on my own. When I moved it, however, it began to slide
down.1 ’FRED* did not allow me to. step out from between the i-ails, and
just went on beating me all the time. The tipper went sliding back and
I got trapped between it and another one standing a little furthex' down the
rails. I broke one leg and received one wound in the same leg which is
still visible,and cut the fingers of my right hand very badly,
5.	After this accident I was taken to the hospital where I
remained for some tine. It so happened that ‘FRED* was the Oapo in charge of
the -Revier then. One day during this period he came in accompanied by a
few more Capos and went round the ward and picked oxrt five men. They
explained to the five picked men that they were going to give them an
injection which would make them well very quickly, so that they could go
back to work. They took them into a separate room one by one. Later
I saw the bodies of these men dumped into the box which held the corpses.
The name of one of these five men was CYTRYN, a Polish Jew* The names of
the others, I do not know. During the time I was in hospital men. were dying
at a rate of nearly 100 a week. Many died as soon as they came in, usually
due to the beatings they had received from ‘FRED’ and other Capos.
6.	As soon as I was able to walk again, with the help of a
stick I left the hospital. One day *FRED* told me to walk faster and when
X could not he took my stick, on which I Yvas leasing, and beat me, with it.
7*	One morning during Appell one of the Capos found a piece of
metal bn a pilsoner which the prisoner used for cutting bread. •FRED*
assisted by other Capos beat this man with a rubber truncheon until he
collapsed. Another Capo named PAUL poured a bucket of urine over him and
the man moved again, ‘FRED1 and other Capos took turns beating the man
until the man collapsed and did not move again* I saw him being carried to
the Revier and the next morning I saw his dead body beixxg thrown into the ■
box.

out all elderly women, those \ Lose bodies showed any marks and those whos
bodies were not .very, nice to look at. If a woman or child so .selected
did not move guickly.enough KITT hit them savagely with the buckle ox
his belt and kicked them viciously. On many occasions women, illtreated
i'n this manner, bled from nose and mouth. At the end of.each selection• )

iUKM&HT OP 'EXAICQIATidk OK Samuel TOEONGZYK of POLAND, duly sworn states:
I am 23 years of age of Polish'nationality bom at KOBYLHIK, POLAND.
lity permanent^ addresi is EmEK 18, OZOEKGW, EOUCND. . I am at present
living at Block 74, Room 2^.HOME (BELSM) Camp, GESMAM..
1.	In January 1942 I was sent to the ORZQKOV Ghetto
because I am. a Jew. In July 1942 I was taken to the LODZ Ghetto
(ZIDOV/SKA 18) where I remained until August 1944 when I was transferred
to AUSCKUTZ Concentration Cai^p. ai\d then, fourteen days later, to the
HANHO'raR-STECKEN Concentration Camp, At the end of November or early
December 1944 I was sent to the AHLM Concentration Camp near HANNOVER
and in early April 1945 I was taken to BELSM Concentration Camp where
I was liberated, by the British, on 15th April 1945*
2.	On 17th December 1945 I was take^i to the BEL SEN
DETENTION CELLS where I whs shown .five teen. I picked out; one who is the
person referred to in my deposition as •FEED’. I have also been shown
a iiumber of photographs and have picked out. No. 7 on Photograph z/4/3 as
-also being this man. He was a Capo and later First Capq at both HANNOVER-
: STECKEN and AHLEM. I am now told that his iull name' is Ferdinand GROSSE.
3,	fhen our transport arrived at HANNOVER-STECKEN we
were, split-up into, three,and .put into different blocks. I was
sent to Block 2 together with some 350 other prisoners and 'FEED* was
our’Block Leader. The first thing he did was to make us discard our
boots, which he took away. We were then given %ry inferior boots, most
of which must have been condemned as they were in tatters. I myself was
given a pair of: wooden boots.
^ 1	..	,/i P
4.0 ... 1 .... .j .frequently witnessed ’FEED' b&at men brutally
either with a heavy stick-.or with a rubber truncheon and saw many of
his ©ivstias collapse under the blows. ■’FEED* often walked round our
sleeping quarters at night and at randorp hit men lying on their beds,
with’either stick or rubber truncheon. He newer stopped hitting a man
before he was, bleeding a lot. Sometimes ’FEED’ would hold an Appell in
the middle of the night and make us stand outside the Block for hours,
regardless of weather conditions. Whenever anyone had to get up during
the night to reliem himself,'he was beaten by 'FEED1.
3.	. .	About October 1944 'FRED* was the Capo i/c Eevier at
STECKEN.* My cousin, a Polish Jew named Wolf GEL30WIGZ, who was
employed as a Doctor at the Eevier, told me that, on 'FEED’S1 orders,
a Polish Jew named RUBINSTEIN was not allowed to liave any food whatever.
Isy cousin'.had to wathh RUBINSTEIN grow weaker and weaker until eventually
1:0''fried frofii starvation. 1/iy cousin also told me that ’FEED* oft^fe
confiscated thek-ations of the sick and gaw e them to other Capos.

*"'7
6,	Towards the end of November or early December 1944
'FRED1 accompanied our transport to AHLEM. There I was made bataan to
1SEPPL1 another Capo from Yienna, who shared a room with 'FEED1. As
batman I was excused work and had to be in the Capos’ room most of the
time, cleaning up. ’Then ’FRED1 came back from work he would nearly
always give me bread, which, he told me he had taken from other prisoners,
and order me to exchange this for cigarettes, issued to privileged workers.
One day in January 1945 I was unable to get cigarettes for 'FEED* and
he hit me savagely in the face so that I bled from the nose.
7.
Ly»ry everr.rg or during the might a number of
﻿.
yf
prisoners v/ere talcen to the wa^h-hyuse by 'PHED' and other C^os and
when 'PEED' and SEPEL came back to'their room later on I oftev heard
them boast about the number of men Uiey; had hilled by hanging ar
beating., I saw 5 on several/. ooeg^ionS 'PEED' take, ae.n who did not move
fast, enough* after the AppeHn.to the wg.sl;i-house gmcl when;he caiie
back to the room latex- he used, to laugh and tell me that he had $iade
them join "Petrus' 12th Array in Heaven". Every morning when I‘went
to-the wash-house for a.wash, ! saw dead bodies of the me$, sometimes
thei’e were six or more* TEey .looked horrible; their faces were black
and swollen, the skul] gaiasnM in at times. I usually saw them carried
outside by^ the.,Rpvier personnel who: threw them on to the death heap.
The dead were collected every few:days by :a lorry from HAHHO'VE'R.
7
8.	.	Sffiieneyer .there was an air raid' warning all prisoners,
with the exception of the Capos and their batmen had to go to the shelter,
Some of the men were too weak to get up and 'PEED', assisted by other
Capos, would then go. through tfxe Hocks and whoever was found was taken
to the wash-house 'for treatment*. I .saw .the .men being led into the
-wash-house and'their deadhbbdies lying, there, in the morning. I had
■ already known' that they'had been killed, from the jokes 'PEED' and the
other Capo" mad* on their return to the. room.; The many victims of
'FEED'S' sadism and ^cruelty included my friends JASCHEMSKI,
LMDAU and Jj&OKKA, all Polish Jews.

POLAl'ID. I am at present living at Block 45, Room 7, HOHNE (BELSEI^) Camp,
GERMANY.
1.	I was arrested by the Germans at my home in December 1941,
because I am a Jewess, and was sent to the TREHLIMA. extermination camp, but
I escaped en route and hid for three weeks in the village of EEHKY. I then
went to various Ghettos and in January 1942 was taken from the GZIZEF Ghetto
to the ZEMBEUW Concentra ion Camp. In February 1942 I was sent to the
AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp where I remained until January 1945 then being
transferred to the RAVENSBRUCK Concentration Camp. After two weeks at
RAVENSBRUCK I was sent to the MALCHOW Labour Camp, near RAVEHSBEUCK. At
the end of April 1945 I was sent to a place near SCHWERIN where I was
liberated by the Americans on 2nd May 1945«
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs and recognise
the shown as No.2 on Photograph FC/6 as an SS Scharfuhrer who was at the_
MALCHOW Camp during ray stay there. I have now been told that his name is
Karl FRANK.
3.	FRANK was assistant Camp Commandant and was one of the worst
SS man in the Camp. He was never to be seen without his stick, which was
about 3 cm. thick and one and a half metres long. I often witnessed how
FRANK beat women brutally and if they collapsed he kicked them. He never
stopped hitting or kicking a woman until she bled profusely and often I saw
victims being carried to the Revier after such beatings.
li.,,	I remember one case in particular. Hunger had maae one oi che
women go near the kitchen to look for scraps. This was lorbiciuen. ifRANK
saw her and chased .her on his bicycle. I saw him first knock her down with
the bycycle and then beat and kick her savagely until she collapsed. The
woman was bleeding from many wounds and had to be taken to the Revier.

My permanent home is CSEPESZ VOM 12, SZATU-MARE, ROUMANIA. I am at present

1.	I lived in SZATU-MAHE until May 1944 when I was arresteds because
I am a Jewess, by the Hungarian Police who took me to KOSIOEpin SLOVAKIA,
where German guards took over and took me to AUSCHWITZ. I stayed at
AUSCHWITZ until July 1944 and was then taken to EEUSATZ, about 100 km*.
from BERLIN, where I worked in a factory. In March 1945 I was sent to
H3LSEN Concentration Gamp, on foot, with 800 other prisoners.
2.	This march was so terrible that only about 100 arrived of the
800 who started out. It took 7 weeks and we were guarded by SS men.
There was almost nothing to eat and we lived only on what food we could
beg from the houses we passed.
3,	I have jfeoday been shorn a number of photographs and of these I
recognise No.3 on Photograph FC/14 as one of the SS men in charge of this
march. I did not know his name- but I am now told that it is ANfIGUR
LUDHARDT.
4.	I have seen him shouting at people who came out of the houses to
give our struggling column bread or potatoes. He said they should not
give us anything to ea.t, because we were only Jews. Whenever he saw any
woman obtaining some food from the Germans he beat her and shouted ^.t her.
5,	On one occasion I and my sister were hit by him with a rifle butt,
I in the hip and my sister on the head, I also saw him hit many women in
the face with the butt of his rifle,and several had their noses broken
by him.
6.	I never saw him kill anybody but he is.responsible for the many
deaths because he did not arrange for proper feeding on this inarch. He
left us at the gate when we arrived in EELoEH. u y’ -

I am 21 year's of age of Polish nationality born at WARSAW. My permanent
home is STOJESTSKA §P WARSAW, POLAND. . I am at present living at Block L 3,
Rooi 32, HOHME (B..LSEN) Camp, ©IRMANY.
1.	In May 1942 I was arrested, because- I am a'Jewess, and
was taken to LUBLIN, where I stayed until I was transferred to HLYZIN in
August 1943. In August 1944 I was sezit to AUSCryiTZ and was then':sent to
EELSEN in October 1944 where I stayed until the liberation on 15th April 1945»
2c	I have today been shown a number of photographs and
I have picked out the one marked PG/7/2 as a man I knew by the name of SCHRAMM*
I am non told that his full name is Martin SCHRAi-K.
3„	I first saw SCfK&I on the aerodrome at LUBLIN, which
was a big transit ca.^ , '.'here he was Commandant. I saw him. there often
when trucks were being loaded with people, just the other side of the barbed
wire. He went along and beat people brutally with a whip and kicked them.
There usually was such a crowd of peopl> that 1 could not see exactly whst
happened to the people he hit, but I could always hear screams. Sometimes
he came into our camp and here too he used his whip freely. I myself have
been beaten by him and the whip, which was loaded with lead at the end,
caused flesh wounds and severe bruises. Wien I did not bend down far
enougfet SCHRAMM kicked me in the teeth with his boots. There was no reason
at all for this beating.
4.	A few months' after ay arrival at HLYZIN, SCHRAMM
appeared again. He was put in cliarg1 of all works, and. beat riisoners
as savagely as ever. Furthermore he had now acquired a huge dog which he
had trained to attack people on hi# orders. As soon as he'motioned, to
hid dog it bit prisoners in the leg or arm, tearing out chunks of flesh
every time. SCINALK often went round the various workshops and looked
in the windows. He then came in and beat those prisoners who he chougnt
were not working hard enough^. It was not uncommon for people to collapse
unconscious after his beatings.	-	-	*	---

SUMMARY of EXAMINATION of Siegfried GRUSZKOWSKI
of PCLAND, dioly sworn states:
I am twenty-tv/o years of age, of Polish nationality, horn at
LITZMANNSTADT, POLAND. My permanent address is Kopemica 55,
LITZMAMSTADT, POLAND.
I am at present living at:
(Otu.sS'sJcfiHr,
e,uoc.x	*°°’1 3-'
X.	in April, 1940, I ms sent to the ghetto in LITZMANNSTADT
because I am a Jew. I remained there until sent to AUSCHYITZ in
September, 191)4. I stayed there for two weeks, and was then
transferred to HANNOVER, STECKEN. Early in December, 1944, _ I was
moved to HANNOVER, AHLM, where I remained until the beginning of
April. I was then taken to BELSEN and was liberated by British
troops on the 15th April, 1945«
2.	I have to-day on this 1st day of January, 1946, been
shown six persons at BELSHN Detention Cells, where I picked out the
man I knew*by the name of SEIFERT. I am now told that this is in
fact his name.
■j.	Whilst I was in the ghetto at LHZMA3MSTADT 3EE?ERT'
was in charge of the ghetto administration. When the selections
started he came round with the Oommandant, BIEBOW, and made these
selections personally. 1 have myself seen SEIFERT go along such a
selection parade and knock people on the chest* These people had to
step to one side and were later taken away and never seen again. I
have also seen SEIFERT come to the station whilst.people were being
loaded on cattle wagons and beat prisoners wildly with the handle of a
shovel. Many collapsed under his blows, and I know that many «ied,
because I was loading the prisoners on to the trucks, and I saw that
many of those so beaten by SEIFERT were dead.
2^	i remember that one day in 1943 a public hanging was
arranged by BIEBOW and SEIFERT.x Two Jews were hanged on this
occasion, one for having stolen a piece of leather, and the other for
having attempted to escape. SEIFERT also made several speeches in
the ghetto in which he said that anyone trying to oppose the selections
vrould be shot.
5.	• Before my transport went to AUSCHWITZ, SEIFERT told
everyone to take all valuables with them to GERMANY, where we w®r®
now going to work, and where we vrould need them to buy food ana clothes.
The great majority, I know, followed his advice. A week after our
arrival in AUSCHWITZ SEIFERT suddenly appeared and ordered a parade
in a washroom, where he made everyone undress. Everybody was
searched thoroughly and all valuables were taken away. SEIFERT also
said that anyone attempting to keep such valuables would be shot.
After that SEIFERT disappeared and I have not seen him again until
today.
g.	I have today been shown six persons at BELSEN^ Detention
Cells and I have picked out the one I knew by the name oj. Emil KRAUSE.
7.	KRAUSE came to STECKEN about November, 1944- He was
at first a foreman at the rubber factory, where I have often seen him
brutally beat prisoners. I have seen people collapse after these
beatings, bleeding profusely, and frecjueptly his victims died, and
their dead bodies were carried to a box where all the dead were piled﻿- 2 -
8.	Wnen we came to AHLEM KRAUSE* 3 ruthlessness and
brutality earned him quick promotion. He was made a Capo, and only,
three weeks after that a BbcKLeader. All this time he went on beating
prisoners and there was not a day when I did not see some of his
victims either carried to the revier or straight to the 'death" box.
5.	Of the many incidents I have witnessed one I remember very
well. It was the murder of the seventeen-year old POLISH Jew named
Schmul BUCHMAN, from LITZMAMSTADT. We were queueing for soup when
I saw KRAUSE hit the boy with a ladle, splitting his head. open. The
boy was taken to the revier where he later hlied, and I save his body „
carried from the revier to the death box. ^

FURTHER SUMMARY OF EXAMINATION OF Si^gfri^d GRUSZKOWSKI, of &
^POLAND, duly sworn states:-
1.	On 31st December 1945 I was taken to the BELSEN
DETENTION CELLS where during an identification parade consisting
of 5 men, I picked out the man referred to in my deposition
as FRED. I am now told that his full name is Ferdinand GROSSE.
He was a Oapo at HAENOTER-AHLEM.
2.	FRED v/as in charge of Block 1 at AHLEM and some Red
Army men, a Captain and three Serjeants, with whom I was very
friendly lived there. They told me that they had fought
at STALINGRAD and that they ?;ere taken prisoner later and
taken to BERLIN, and then to HANNOVER-AHLEM.	One day late
in March 1945 the rumour got round that the Capos had received
orders to murder all Red A&my Officers and N.C.O’s. The
only ones at AHLSM at the time were my friends and the next
morning I saw their dead bodies lying in the boz wherethe dead
were always put. One of the Serjeants, who I remember came
from ODESSA, had his head smashed in and they all showed signs
of brutal illtreatment. Their bodies were black and blue.
I did not live in Block 1 but everybody in the camp was saying
that FRED had. murdered the Russians during the night. Later
during the same day I overheard FRED tell another Capo, named
Gustav EINHORN, who was in charge of Block 5, that he had
killed the Red Army men the night before.

SULMABY QP EXAMINATION OP Paul BEDER of Poland, duly sworn states
I am 29 years of age, of Polish nationality, bom at LODZ, POLAND.
My permanent address is: Pomorska 101, LODZ, POLAND*
I am at present living at Giessen near FRAMFURT ON MIN, Ebelstrasse 11
1.	I was taken to the LODZ Ghetto in March 1940 because
I am a Jew and had to live at Wolborska 25 until August 1944. I ms then
sent to AUSCHWITZ for three weeks and from there to the DORA Concentration
Camp near Nordhausen. At the end of March 1945 I was transferred to BELSEN
where I was liberated by the British on 15th. April 1945*
2.	On 31st. December 1945 I was taken to the EEL SEN
DETENTION CELLS where during an identification parade consisting of five
men, I picked out the man referred to in my deposition as SEIFERT. He was
in charge of the administation of the GHETTO at LODZ.
3.	I was employed by the Food Office at the Ghetto and so often
came into contact with SEIFERT. I know that he was largely responsible for
the appalling conditions in the Ghetto and especially for the inadequate
rations and feeding arrangements which must have been the direct cause
of the death of many thousands of the Ghetto inmates.
4.	Between 1942 and 1944 when the Ghetto ms finally
dissolved many different trans orts of men, women and children were sent
away for extermination. Since on such occasions I was always employed on
loading the victims on to the lorries I saw SEIFERT take an active part
in the selections.. The people had to come downstairs and line up in
front of SEIFERT who made some stand to one side. These people were then
loaded on to the lorries and never seen or heard of again. In Spptember
1942 I was present when SEIFERT selected my four sisters Mala BEDER,
Regina BEDER, Ibka EEDER, Sala BEDER and my brother Schimson BEDER, all
Polish Jews, outside Wolborska 25 to be taken away with a transport
that left LODZ for extermination. He also included an old friend of mine
the Polish Jewess FRIEDMN who lived at Wo^borska 25. They were made
to mount the waiting trucks together with snany others who had been selected
by SEIFERT and that was the last I ever saw or heard of them.
5.	During the round up for this extermination transport
in September 42, I was again employed on loading the people who had been
selected on to the lorries. I naturally tried to make them as comfortable
and so told them to sit as closely as possible. SEIFERT supervised the
loading and when he noticed what I was doing came up to me and said 'Don't
make such a fuss with these creatures, just pile them on, one on top of the
other and when the lorry is filled get up and jump on their bodies in order
to make room for some more. When I would not do so SEIFERT drew his
pistol and threatened to shoot me for disobeying his order.
6.	During the same round-up in September 1942, I remember
on one occasion our lorries drew up outside the Hospital in the Brewnoska
strasse. SEIFERT was with us at the time and as we arrived there were
a number of people in the streets nearby* No one was supposed to be out
and when SEIFERT saw the people he dfcew his revolver and fired at them.
I saw him hit a boy of about 16 who fell to the ground, screaming loudly
SEIFERT thereupon went up to him and I saw him fire three shots into the
boy's head. The boy did not move again.
7*	One day, in the simmer of 1943, & Jew stole a piece of
leather from a workshop in the Ghetto. The man was traced and a mass
meeting was called on the MARISCHIN field, which many inmates of the
Ghetto including myself had to attend. When everybody was present I
heard SEIFERT give the order for the Jew to be hanged and we were all
present when the sentence was carried out.
8.	I have been shown various photographs and from these have
picked out the man on photograph DPS 1 as being BIEBOW, who was AMTSLEITER
of the Ghetto at LODZ. I am now told that his full name is HANS BIEBOW.﻿9.	BIEBOW was the man in cliarge of the Ghetto, at LODZ
and of all Jew's living in the surrounding districts. He played a
prominent part in the selections that took place on different occasions hetwea
1942 and 1944. I saw him pick out people, from the ones lined up before
him and these chosen were sent away on trucks never to be seen or heard
of again.
10.	During the round up in September 1942 near the
hospital in the Drewnoska strasse a man and a woman, aged approx. 45 and
35 respectively, tried to escape from the transport that was just being qc
made up. They were just trying to climb over a fence when EUBOff	444
arrived in his car. He saw them and drove his car up to them. I saw him
take them to a nearby potato field and there he made them kneel down
facing each other very closely so that their faces touched. He then
went behind the woman drew his revolver and shot her through the bade of
her neck. The bullet must have penetrated her neck and then struck the
man, because they both collapsed and did not move again.
11.	A further murder by BIEBOW was witnessed by me in
early August. 1944. I happened to be in Marenarskastrasse and saw an old
Jew/ of about 70 sitting on a bundle of clothes outside house Ho.81. The
man was in a pitiable conditions, his face was haggard, his feet swollen
badly and he was wailing, BIEBOW noticed him and went up to him and
discharged his revolver three or four times into the old man's body.
The Jew collapsed at once and did not move again.

1.	in November, 1940, I was taken to the ghetto in
LITZMANNSTADT, POLAND. I escaped from there in May, 1944, and joined
a partisan band with whom I stayed until July, 1944, when I joined the
Red Army. I fought with the 226th Division and finally came to BERLIN,
where I got in touch with the British authorities, who arranged my
journey to BELSEN in September, 1945-
2.	Whilst I was in the ghetto at LITZMANNSTADT, SEIFERT
was in charge of the ghetto administration. I was then working wioh
an organization known as the "white guards". Our job was the^ ^ ^ ^
unloading and handling of ration stores in the ghetto, under SEIFERT s
personal supervision. It was SEIFERT's routine to drive people^ at
work and if he did not think that we were unloading the trucks ^fast
enough he took the slow workers away. I do not know what he did to
them, but I never saw them again.
In particular, I remember one incxdent in June, 1945,
when I was unloading a wagon of coal with my brother, Salomon GI-VUER.
SEIFERT came and told us that we had to unload the truck^in ten
minutes. When ten minutes had passed and we had not finished our task,!
SEIFERT came and. led try brother, who was looking rather weak, away y
the collar. I did not see what he did to ray brother, but I have never
seen or heard of ray brother since.

CviSS/rS
i	Whenever there were any selections in the ghetto
SEIFERT came round with BIEBOW and FUCHS. My father, two sisters
aged 11 and 22, and ray brother aged 7, were all selected by SEIFERT
himself, who came into our room to take them away. _ I was not
present myself when he took them, but I was told this later by my
Seiejsd Monjek SEIDORF, who was working on night shifts and was
present at the time. SEIFERT also said, that he would take my
mother away, but she was ill at the time and died shortly after.
SEIFERT addressed all the workers at the ghetto and
told us that anyone attempting to oppose the selections would be
killed.

1.	I lived in RZEKI until May 1940 when I was taken
for forced labour to BILSKN near HAMBURG-. In 1941 I was arrested
by the German Police for three minor offences. Not wearing
the P sign, using a bicycle and leaving the village without
permission. I was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment, which I
served in various German prisons, and in June 1944 I was sent
to NEUENGAMME. In	^4-4- I was sent to MISBURG Concentration
Camp and on April 9tti 194-5 I was taken to the BELSEN Concentration
Camp where I stayed until the liberation on 15th April 1945.
2.	In MISBURG Concentration Camp I worked in a factory

MATIG stole goods from the factory and took th m back to the
Camp for the SS man.
3.	In	January	1945 MATIG told me that he was going

that he was to be sent to an S3 unit in NORWAY.. We were
evacuated from MISBURG before his release papers came through.
4.	At	the end of March I overheard the Chief Capo
WAGNER, tell DAB-DWORSKE, a fellow prisoner, that he was to
be marked with coloured materials. This was the mark for
likely escapees who were specially watched and guarded.

SWimM OF EXM/ilWATION OF Pola BEEITBERG, of P0LA1®, duly sworn states
I am 19 years of age of Polish nationality born at PIOTRKOW, POLAND. W
permanent address is GAENCAISKA 13 > PIOTRKOW, POLAND. I am at present
living at Block H 2, Room 18, HOHliE (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY.
1,	in May 1940 the part of PIOTSKW where I lived became
a*Ghetto and I stayed there until July or August 1943 when I was taken to
BLYZIN. In August 1944 I was tran ferred to AUSCHWITZ and in November 1944
I was sent to a Labour Camp at KMZAU. in CZECHOSLOVAKIA where I was
liberated by Russian troops on 9th May 1945.
2.	I have been shown a number of photographs and I recognise
No.2 on Photograph FC/7 as being a person I knew by the name of SCHRAMM. I
am now told that his full name is Martin SCHRAMM.
SCHRAMM came to BLYZIN about October or November 1945 and
was Oberscharfuhrer in charge of all works. To enable him to watch people
at work at all times, he abolished blackout precautions. At night he went,
round the workshops and looked in the windows. I was working in the knitting
shop and I remember a particular incident there during the winter 1943/44.
SCHRAMM came in one evening and went up to a man who had rested for a moment.
He beat this man with his whip until the man was bleeding and had lost
consciousness. The man, a Polish Jew, had to be taken to hospital. SCHRAMM
then turned to the supervisor of the workshop, a Capo, and beat him. On
another occasion SCHRAMM was watching again at the window and saw someone
go to the stove. He shot his pistol into the shop through the window hy hit
no one.
SCHRAMM beat prisoners constantly, sometimes altogether
without reason. Often the pretext was, that the prisoner had failed to
remove his hat when he passed. These beatings often caused wounds and I have
seen prisoners so beaten, taken to hospital. I have seen, myself, the severe
bruises these beatings caused, which often could still be seen many weeks later,
5,	SCHRAMM had a big dog by the name of ASA which he had
trained to attack prisoners on his orders. As soon as he motioned to the
doe it attacked a prisoner teatring his or her clothing and often causing
flesh wounds in aims or legs. As soon as SCHRAM-I ordered the dog back it came
back. The dog only acted on SCHRAMM*s orders.

I am 40 years of age of Polish nationality bom at LODZ, POLAND, l.!iy
permanent address is MENAKSEA 8, LODZ, POLAND. I am at present living
in Block 29, Soom 5, HOME (EELSEN) Camp, GERMANY.
1,	I lived in the LODZ Ghetto until August 1944 when % was
taken to AUSCHWITZ. In November 1944 I was sent to Lower Silesia where
I worked in the Camps at KALTWASSER, LECHJO, SCHLOSSENBUEG ,&nd KANAKI.
I escaped from KANAKI in April 1945 and hid in the woods until I was found,
by the advancing Americans,in May and taken to hospital.
2.	On 31st December 1945 I was taken to Pinewood Gaol where
I was shown a number of men. I recognised one of them as SEIPERT whom I
knew as a member of the Ghetto administration at LODZ.
3,	I have seen SEIFERT talcing part in the re-settlement drives
in the Ghetto when people were selected for work or for transports to go away.
One day during the drive in 1943 I' saw SEIFEBT standing in the middle of
the street supervising this process, when a man of about 23 came out of a
house and tried to enter another house which had been searched already.
SEIFERT shot at him with a sma],! pistol and the man fell to the ground. ^
I saw that the man “had been hit in the chest with the bullet and he was
then taken to hospital. I never saw this man again.
/
4.	in these drives there was the following procedure. Soldiers
or SS men surrounded a whole block of houses and small groups of policemen
went into each house under the command of one of the higher officials, either
BIEBOW, SCHWIND, FUCHS, SjCHMIDT or SEIPERT. These selections went on
with many shootings and beatings.

1 am 36 years of age of Polish nationality bom at TOMASZOf,'POLAND.
Uy permanent address is WSCHODNIA 11, TCM&SZW, POLAND. I am at present
living at Glyn Hughes Hospital, War A III, Room 81, HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp,
GERMANY.
1.	In May 1940 I was sent to the Ghetto at TOMASZOw,
because I am a Jew, where I remained until July 1943 When I was taken
to BLYZIN. In July 1944 I was transferred to AUSCHWITZ where I stayed
untj.1 October 1944 then being sent to ORANIMBURG. In November 1944
I was taken to DACHAU where I was liberated by the Americans on 27th
April 1945*
2.	I have today been shown a number of photographs and
I have picked out one marked DEj/6 as a man I knew by the name of WEBER,
and to whom I refer in this deposition. I am now told that his full
name is Michael WEBER.
3.	In BUZIN I was working in the carpenters shop. Whilst
I was working there an SS man by the name of WEBER arrived, who .was put
in charge of’ this department.' "From that time on WEBER beat prisoners
every day with a heavy leather whip, never stopping before he drew blood.
In many cases his victims were removed,unconscious, to the Revier.
4.	One day I was eating a pece of bread whilst working.
WEBER tied his whip round my neck, and dragged me along until I fell to
the ground. Then he loosened the whip and beat me savagely.
5.	Finally I succeeded to get away from the carpenters
shop and was put into a Commando doing outside work. One day we came
back from work and I had managed to buy broad outside from a Pole.
When we marched through the Camp, WEBER saw me, and called me. He
searched me and found the bread, and threw it to the dogs. He then
ordered me to stand to attention facing the barbed wire for five^hours.
That day it was cold, and it was raining and snowing. When I finished
the punishment I was feeling weak and faint. A few days later I was
taken to hospital with pluritis and I stayed in hospital for eight weeks.
I arm in hospital again now with the same complaint, and it is doubtful
whether I shall ever^ be fit again.
WEBER beat a Polish Jew from BIALYSTOK brutally until
he was bleeding heavily from many vraunds. He was then taken to the
Revier and I was told later by Raffael ZUCKEKMANN, a Polish Jew, who
was a frieddof this man, that he died. YffiBER constantly threatened
that he would kill us, and boasted of the fact that he had already killed
hundreds in LUBLIN.
7.	I also recognise No.2 on Photograph FC/7 as a.man I
knew by the name of SCHRAMM. I am now told that his full name is Martin
SCHRAMM..
8.	SCHRAMM was the man in charge of all workshops in
BLYZIN. He often came to the carpenters shop whilst I was working there
nd together with 1EBER checked prisoners coming back to work after the
lunch break. Three or four rainutes before time they closed the doors
and anyone not in the shop by then was beaten.brutally by tnese two.
I have often seen SCHRAMM administering his brutal beatings and have﻿﻿Exhibit "530"

FURTHER SUMMARY OF EXAMINATION OF Binem MERIN, of POLAND, duly sworn states
I am 36 years of age 'of Polish nationality born at T0MASZ01, POLAND. Hjr
pei’sianent address is Wschodnia 11, TOMASZOW. I sirt at present living at Glyn
Hughes Hospital, Ward A III, Ro*om 81, HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY.
1,	In May 194®- I Vas sent to the Ghetto at TOMASZOW, because I am
a Jew, where I remained until July 1943 when I was taken to BLY^SIN. In July
1944 I was transferred to AsUSCI:..T!Z where I 'stayed until October 1944 then
being sent to ORAMENBURG. In November 1944 I was taken to DACHAU where I was
liberated by the Americans on 27th Apri'l 1945•
2.	In May 1940 a ghetto was formed in TOMASZOW. All Jews of the
town were moved into the ghetto and were not allowed to leave it unless in the
possession of a duty-pass. I have forgotten the name of the man who was
first in charge of the ghetto, but 'WIESE,who was then Second-in-Command",later
became Commandant. A man by the name of FREES was responsible for the
administration, of the ghetto. There we-re a number of Gestapo agents among
whom I remember BETTICH, KEMP, SCHMIDT, and HUNGER. In addition to those
there was a detachement of Schupo (German police) comaanded by a man named
GR8SER, whose deputy was PICHLER. Other meh in the police were REICHEL, OLSCH,
KROPFISCH, and FUCHS. There waS also a detachment of Kripo (Criminal police)
in the ghetto, under the direction of Untersturrnfuhrer SS PREUSS and RttSSLER
as*his deputy.
5,	From the time when the ghetto was formed it was the practise
■of the members of all of the above mentioned organisations to make very
frequent house searches, wrhich in fact were no more than looting expeditions.
They took any valuables they could lay their hands on and where they were not
satisfied with what they found, the owner of the house was beaten up until
such time as he surrendered sufficient to satisfy the searchers. I earned a
textile factory and searches here occured almost every second day. Among
those who came to search were EEICHEL, BETTICK, and PICHLER. They nevdr left
until I had given them some articles out of my stock,	'
; 4.	Rations in the ghetto were insufficient, and illegal supplies
were passed into the camp by Poles. Anyone who v/as caught with such rations
was either sent to AUSCH.7ITZ or put into prison, where he was kept until a.
friend or relative bought him out for some tremendous amount of money, ‘ These
were the general conditions prevailing up to the end of 1941.
5.	In the early Winter months of‘1942 the food position in the
ghetto went from bad to worse. Any stocks which had been saved up'earlier
v/ere now exhausted and the present supply was irregular‘and badly organised.
s Y/henever possible, women and children got out of the ghetto to obtain food
from nearby farms. A great number*of these people were caught'and shot on the
spot. The majority of victims were children. Among those who carried out
these shootings were two German policemen known by the nick-names of "WITZEC"
and "WATZEC" throughout the ghetto, and REICHEL. I remember one particular
case I witnessed when REICHEL shot a barber, a Polish Jew by the name of - SALIM,
because he suspected him of hiding smuggled food under his clothing. After he
had shot the man he searched him, but failed to justify his suspicion. He
turned to the onlookers and said "Well, anyway he must have had evil thoughts".
6.	One night at the end of April 1942 a number of prominent
inhabitants of the ghetto were dragged out of their beds during the night and
shot in front of their houses. I heard the shooting during the night and saw
the bodies lying outside the houses the f ollowing morning. About a week later
I heard shots again, and as I suspected the same thing going on, I hid-in the
cellar of my house. REICHEL did in fact come to collect me but my mother told
him that I was out. This explanation was accepted by him, as I had permission
to leave the ghetto and travel in a radius of 35 1®. to collect salvage
material. The people who were murdered during these two nights were mostly
the prominent people in the ghetto, some of the names I can still, remember are
$1 KOHN, Edward JUWILER, BERLINER, HERZ, all doctors, HIRSCHSPRUNG and STEENFSLD,
" lawyers, WARZAGER, BALBTN, NOVOMIAST, MASELSCHEIN, ASCH and ALTER, all Polish
jews -and members of the Jewish Council, and a Polish Jew named MHHLSTEIN who
<j^ )^^®rjj)U'kch€jr. ^png those who carried out the shooting were BETI’IoH, PICHLER,﻿7«	'	Prom this time onwards cases of shooting became a daily
occurrence. Two instances which I remember are the following* I was
living at Krzyzowa 16 where the wire separating the ghetto from the rest
of the town crossed the rodd just next to my house. One day I heard shouting
downstairs and looking out of the window, I saw FUCHS persuing a woman down
the road until he cornered her near the barbed wire. He drew his revolver
and fired three times at the woman who colla.psed immediately and the body
was later put on to a aart and taken away. The woman’s name was ZELAZIttK,
a Poli’sh Jewess. The reason for the shooting was that she had been seen
receiving goods from a Foie through the wire. Another case I saw fron^ my
window was when FUCHS chased two women under rather similar circumstances.
One woitian’s name was FRENKEL, a Polish Jewess, the other one I do not know.
FUCHS shot both of them. The woman whose name I do not know died on the
spot and was taken away on a cart. FRENKEL was taken to the Revier, where
she died a few days later. ' But cases like these were only typical of what
was going on in the ghetto day by day and in very many cases the victims
were children.
8.	In October 1942 signs and rumours were in evidence
pointing to the imminence of selections ("Aussiedelungen"). Information
trickled through from other ghettos about these selections. The trains
loaded with Jews from RADOM ghetto passed "throupb TOMASZOIY and were seen,
the guards were being strengthened1, flood lights wens being installed all
around the camp near the wire. Finally a company of Ukranian soldiers
arrived to further strengthen the guards. I realised that selections would
start in a matter of a day or so now, and making use of my dutyipass which
I have already explained and mentioned, I left the ghetto for one week.
When I returned the greatest part of the selections had been completed and
apart from a few more men v.ho were put into a train which passed from another
ghetto a few days later, there were no more selections for the time being.
I was told by the people who still remained, that during' the selections
hundreds of people had been shot, and that all thfese who were sent away
.went to the extermination camp at THEBLINKE. None of the people who went
there were ever seen or heard of again,
9.	TQEASZOW ceased to exist as a ghetto and became a wfopking
camp, considerably reduced in size. Of 17,000 people once living; in the
ghetto some 800 now remained. Everyone was now forced to work and one of
the tasks was thedearance of the former ghetto. Conditions were very bad,
and food insufficient.
10.	UndeP the pretext that those selected were to go to
Palestine another selection was made on 5th January 1943« Either 186 or
188 people were selected, mainly ..omen and children, among them my sister
in law with her two child en. They were put on horse carts and taken to
UJAZD, about 11km. from T0MASZ0W, where they were loaded on trains and also
sent to TEEBLIHKI. None of these were ever heard of or seen again. These
selections were made under the direction of GRBSE.R, PIGHLER, gEIGHED; PUGHS,
KROPFISCH, and other ghetto officials.	.	,Sc
H,	A month or two later another 82 people were selected by
G-RBSER and PICHLER. Two lorries drew up and the people were loaded on to
them. Later it became known that these men went to an ammunition factory
at PlONKI, near RADQM-j to worfe there. A man by the name of RUHENSKI, a
Polish Jew, who was among these, thinking that this was another transport
for’extermination, took 30 tablets of a sleeping draught in an attempt to
commit suicide. He was taken to hospital in a dangerous condition. Two
or throe days later, RUBINSKI was already a lot better, FUCHS arrived at
the hospital and took RUBINSKI out with him. On the following morning I
saw RUBINSKI's body lying against a mil, he had been shot.
12.	’ At the end of March or beginning of April 1943 a full
parade was called, this was arranged by the Gestapo and I remember that
BETTICH, KEMP, and HUNGER were present. On this parade we were ordered
to bring all valuables and deliver them up to the aforementioned. To
underline the urgency of the demand, KELP selected four men, Menachim
VLGLKOWITZ, FAJMANN, end two others, all Polish Jews, whosenames I cannot
new remember. He drew his revolver and shot each of them, holding his
revolver close to their "neck, just behind t'he ear. tfhe bodies were left
lying there for several Hours before 'being removed to tlie grave-yard.
13
Another incident hich happened about the same time,﻿FURTHER SIIJ-ART OF EXAivIII^ATION OF Binem MERIN (Cont.)
Y/as when PICHLER came into the camp in Ms car and gave the Jewish
Oiderly Service a list of 21 names of people whom he wanted rounded
up immediately. These were mainly the remaining prominent citizens
and their families. They were taken out to the grave-yard, where
they were shot and buried in a mass-grave. Their clothing was returned
to the camp the same day. The names of those who were shot on this
occasion were as follows, A lawyer by the name of BERNSTEIN, his wife and
child. Doctor MORTKOWICZ-j, his daughter, his brother, the brother's wife,
the brother's child, and his woman assistant, KOSCIUSKO,(one of the Jewish
orderlies| his wife, and two children, a man by the name of KOZLOV/SKI, a
woman dentist named HKEIN, her husband and daughter, a doctor named	r,
KENIGHEIT and his'wife, and a young lawyer named RhI&RCDZKI and his wife, Rec-
all of whom were Polish Jews.
14.	A few weeks after this had happened, in May or June,
we were sent to ELYZIN. About 650 went and 30 were left behind as a
rear party to clear up. This was the remainder of the Jewish community
of T0MASZ0W, which once numbered more than 17,000.
15.	Since the end of the war I have re-visited T0MASZ0W,
where I have been to the grave yard. I saw the graves of all the people
whom I have mentioned as having been murdered, and many other graves.
I also saw a mass grave containing, amongst others, the bodies of the persons
who were murdered during the Selections,

where during an identification parade consisting of five men
I picked out the man I know by the name of SEIFERT. I am
now told his full name is Franz SEIFERT.
iji PflsiANiefc In the afternoon of 15th May 1942 all the Jews
of -tho town were told to go to the sports field. On our arrival
there we saw SEIFERT, who was in charge of proceedings, standing
at the entrance. As we entered the field he started hitting
us fiercely with a heavy rubber truncheon. He especially beat
those who did not walk fast enough and I saw several women
collapse under the blows and remain lying where they had dropped.
Many people hit by SEIFERT had blood pouring from their heads.
SEIFERT later followed us to Field One, where the women were told
to leave their children and then pass on to Field two. Many
women, especially those with small children and babies, hesitated
to do so. I saw SEIFERT go up to them hit them over the head
with his truncheon and then get hold of the child and throw it on
the ground.	It	had been	raining heavily and	there were some
;' pool's of wat	r so	that' some of the babies	were	drowned. Some
of the women hit by SEIFERT also collapsed and remained lying,
on Field one. During April 1942 all Jews at PABIANICE had had
a letter stamped on the chest; the letter was ^either A or B^iU &
SEIFERT now ordered all those with the letter B^to remain on ^
Field one whereas the letter A people had to move on to Field two.
„ I was gjnongst the	A. people	and none of us	ever	saw or heard of
^the Bjfpeople	again. Some	weeks later at	LODZ	I was to Id, by
Jews there, that they had all been sent to TREBLINKA for
extermination. When all the A people had assembled on FieM.
two, SEIFERT came across and selected a hundred strong men, who
were tc^ld that they would have to assist toth the liquidation of
a the B^tpeonle and children. They included my three brothers
Meier KAMMELGARN, Leon KAMMEE&ARN, Alter KAMMELGARN and my
nephew Moschek ABRAMCZEK, all of whom were Polish Jews. These
men were taken away and that was the last I ever saw or heard
of them.
4.	SEIFERT then selected.another 150 men including
my husband Abraham KOPIK, who has -olneo' diod. All the A people
were then sent to the Ghetto at LODZ where my husband joined me
about three months later. He told me that two days after we
had left PABIANIGE he and the other 149 Jews kept back, had to
assist with the liquidation of the Jewish hospitals under SEIFERT’s
direction. He described to me how children, men and women were
thrown out of the hospital windows on to trucks outside, many
personally thrown out by SEIFERT himself. My husband told me
that many of the patients were killed on being thrown on to
the trucks and that all those put on first died from suffocation
as others were piled on top of them. Amongst these victims﻿were my sister in law Mira ROSEMSAFP, a Polish Jewess and her
five year old child Mascha ROSENSAFT. They Y/ere never heard Mm
of again.
5'.	I saw SEIFERT again at the Q-hetto in LODZ.
I was working permanently in the saddlers workshop and
SEIFERT often came to inspect the place.	If any Jew
was found in the yard or did not work very hard, SEIFERT hit
him savagely with his rubber truncheon.	I saw many people
illtreated in this manner bleed profusely from the face afid
some collapsed under the brutal blows.

SUMIilASY OP EXAMINATION OP Zofia WAJSKOPF of POLAND duly
sworn states:-
I am 17 years of age of Polish nationality horn at TOMASZOW,
POLAND.	My permanent address is Sw. ANTONIEGO 7, TOMASZOW,
POLAND.	My uresent address is Block 26, Room 20, HOHNE
(BELSEN) Gamp, GERMANY.
1.	I was sent to the Ghetto in TOMASZOW, being a
Jewess, in May 1940. I stayed there until October 1942, when I
was transferred to BLYZIN.	In July 1943 I was sent to
AUSCHWITZ, where I remained until January 1944 when I ?ms taken to
to HINDENBURG Labour Gamp. In Janaury 1945 I was transferred
to BELSEN.where I was liberated on 15th April 1945.
2.	I have been shown a number of photographs and I have
picked out No.2 on Photograph PG/7 as a man I know by the name of
SCHRAMM. I am now told that his full name is Martin SGHRAMM.
3*	When BLYZIN was converted from a Labour Gamp to a
Ooncentration camp, in December 42 or January 43, SGHRAMM arrived
there and became the man in charge of all works. I was working in
the knitting shop myself and several times whilst I was on night-
shift SCHRAMM looked into the shop through one of the windows and
if he saw someone not working to his satisfaction he would fire
his pistol into the shop. I have never seen him hit anybody
myself. Sometimes he came into the shop with his large dog. This
dog was trained to bite people on his orders, and on one occasion
SGHRAMM ordered the dog to attack a man standing close to me.
The dog however attacked me instead and bit me in the foot and
through the hand. I still bear the marks of its teeth. The dog
did not attack people unless motioned to do so by SGHRAMM, and
stopped as soon as he called it back. Othe® SGHRAMM beat with his
whip, the end of which was loaded with lead, until they bled
heavily. When he had finished beating prisoners, he told them
not to attempt to go to the Revier, or to staj^ away from work the
following day, as he himself would then drag them out by their
hair.
r* .
4.	If a prisoner failed to lift his cap when he passed he
beat him brutally, often until the prisoner collapsed. Once, on
roll-call, a little boy aged about ten or eleven from TOMASZOW
whose name I cannot remember, overslept, and was therefore late.
He was beaten brutally by SS men on SCHRAMM’s and GOSBERG’s
orders, both of whom were present.

the shoulder with a whip and tore my three year old boy from me and threw him
to the ground. The child cried "Mama" and then BIEBOW went to it and kicked it
with his boots. The child cried once more faintly and did not move any more.
Then BIEBOW hit me again and ordered another man to take me to the other square.
I myself saw several small children die on the square as a result of BIEBOY/'s

SUMMARY OP EXAMIH AT I OH OP Josef. G-OLDBAND of POML'TD duly
sworn states:-
I am 46 years of age of Polish nationality born at OPOGZHO,
POLAND. My permanent address is MLYHARSKA 8, LODZ, POLALiD.
I am at present living at Bloch 29, Room 5, HOHUE (BELSEH)
0 amp, GERMANY•
1.	In April 1940 the street in which I lived
in LODZ became part of the G-hetto and, being a Jew, I was
fpreed to live there until August 1944. I was then sent
to AUSGlJWtTS for about a week and from there to the KAUFERING-
CqnQentration,Camp near .DAGHAU. On the 25th April 1945
I left KAUFEKIITG- for DAGHAU and was liberated en route by
the Americans on the 2?th April 1945.
g.	On the 1st of January 1946 I was taken to
the BSEBEN Detention Cells where during an identification
parade consisting of 5 men, I picked out the man referred
to in this deposition as SEIFERT.	I remember him from
the Ghetto at”LODZ where, he held an executive position and
together with BIBBOW was responsible for the appalling
conditions that Existed there.
3.	I have been shown a number of photographs
and from these I have picked out the man on Photograph DPS/I
as being a man 1 know by the name of BIEBOW,. who was in
charge of the Ghetto at LODZ and of all Jews living in the
surrounding districts. I am now told his full name is Hans BIEBOW.
4.	During 1942, 1943 and 1944 many transports
left LODZ consisting of persons considered unfit to live.
Hone of thp thousands -of men, women and children, who made
up the^ different transports were seen or heard of again by
me after t!hey had left LODZ. At the end of August 1943
ond of these transports was made up. I was at home when
suddenly there were some shots. We were told to go downstairs
and ws we nassed through the front door SEIFERT hit us as
hard as he"could with a rubber truncheon shouting at us to
get atmove.on and line up in four rows outside the house.
Everybody who lived in the street had to line up in ohis
manner and then SEIFERT, BIEBOW and FUCHS divided us into
three sections and each of them commenced to inspect one
section. I was in the section that was inspected by
SEIFERT. He looked us over very carefully and then struck
all children and some adults of either sex with his rubber
truncheon, which meant they had to move to one side of the
street. if a person who had been selected did not move
quickly enough SEIFERT hit him or her brutally with his
rubber truncheon which was strengthened with wire. I saw
SEIFERT go up to a young woman who vras with a child of
about three years of age and have the child taken away
from her. The woman pleaded with him to save her child.	/
SEIFERT thereupon drew his revolver and fired into the
woman. I was only about 8 metres away from the scene and
saw the woman collapse with blood pouring from her chest,
and she did not move again.	SEIFERT then ordered the
child to be thrown on to a lorry. Everybody selected by
SEIFERT was then loaded on to the trucks that had drama
up in our street. They were taken away and that was the
last we ever saw or heard of them.
5
I was employed as an Overseer in a boot factory﻿at the G-hstto and one day in ihe auiuinn 1943 everybody
worked in our factory received the order to assemble on a
field at MARASGHIN.	When we arrived there vre found
that employees from other factories and workshops had been
made to report as well. We were all told to form a circle
round a gallows that had been erected on the field.
331PERT and 3IE30W then arrived in a car and they handed
a paper to a Jewis h Ghetto policeman and told him to read
che contents to us. He read that a Jew had been found
guilty oi stealing a piece of waste leather and that he
would be hanged publicly as punishment. The man. who was
about 35 years old, was then hung on the gallows. \	/

of Janus.r3r 19Lo-
1.	On ITth Jvlay 1942 I was taken to the Ghetto at LODZ, because I am
a Jewess, and had to live there until August 191-4. I was then sent to AUSCHWITZ
where I remained for two weeks- and was then taken to HELSEN. In October 1944 I
was transferred to SALZWEEtEL Concentration Camp and I was liberated there, by
the Americans, on 14th April 1945•
2,	I have been taken to the HELSMI Detention Cells where during an
identification parsde consisting of five men I picked out the nan I know by the
name of SEIFERT. He was present at the liquidation of the Jewish population of
BRSEZJKX and was one- of the high officials at the LODZ Ghetto. He is the man
to whom,I refer in this deposition,	I have also been shown a number ofm
photographs and I have picked out on® marked DPS/l as bein' the "photograph of
a man I know by the name of 3IEB0W. I am now told that his full name is
Hans BIEBOW.
He is the person to whom I refer in this deposition.

3.	On 14th Lay 194-2 all Jewish women of BRZEZII'IY, who had children up
to 10 years of age had to assemble with them on a square near SWIMTA AMY. A
large number of elderly Jews and Jewesses were also present, and I saw BIEBOW,
SEIFERT, the Gestapo official FUCHS and other Germans whose names I do not
remember. BIEBOW was in charge and sorted us into different groups. We were
then all taken to a large house in the SWINTA AKNY. Round about three o'clock
in the morning of 15th Hay 1942 the Germans arrived and the first thing they did
was to throw empty beer or spirit bottles through the windows. Then they came
inside shouting and gesticulating with pistols and *rubber truncheons. SEIFERT,
B1S30W, and the Gestapo official FUCHS were' amongst them, and I could see that
they were all drunk. SEIFERT started to hit women over the head with the handle
of his heavy whip and I saw many collapse under the vicious blows, bleeding
heavily from the face. The Germans then proceeded to take away our children
who were taken outside and loaded on to trucks. SEIFERT and BIEBOW took an
active part in all this. I did not wish to lose my 2-| year old daughter Hannah
MILLER and tried to hide her. The child was very agitated and*I remember her
crying "Please Mammy do not let them, do it - Daddy is not here".	SEIFERT
must have heard this for he came up to me and hit me in the face brutally with
his rubber truncheon, and I bled heavily. He then tore ry baby away from, me
and she was taken outside with the rest.	I was frantic and asked SEIFERT to
shoot we. He only laughtd and said "You mil die anyway", I then saw ny
friend, a Polish Jewess named Eva FUNT, drop to the ground kissing SEIFERT's boots
and pleading for her five year old child. SEIFERT thereupon hit her savagely
with his rubber truncheon. Ly friend lest consciousness under the inhuman blows
and remained lying on the ground in a pool of blood, BIEBO'.Y behaved like a
madman. He was hitting women and children with a tubh’er truncheon and many
collapsed covered in blood. Some of the women were trying to hang on to their
babies and BIEBOW went up to these, rot hold of the children by their legs and
threw them on to the stone floor. Many babies must have been killed that way
for they remained lyir’g quite still and did not move again. They were carried
out later and put on to the.trucks. My friend Sola LECHTTRAGER, also a Polish
Jewess, refused to part with her child. BIEBOW beat her into a state of
unconsciousness and then"the child was taken outside. My friend remained lying
in a pool of blood and later was also taken outside and thrown on to one of the
trucks. Neither she or the children were ever seen or heard of again. After
the trucks had been driven away the Germans abused us and made crude Jokes
concerning our predicament. ~At 12 o'clock on the 15th May 194-2 we were allowed
to return to our homes.
4.
Round about midday on 17th May 1942 all Jews had to line up in﻿front of'their houses. BISBOW, the Gestapo official FUCHS and RICHTER
were present on this occasion. The women were separated from the men
and were made to mount horse drawn carts. If a woman did not move fast
enough BIEBOW got hold of her and beat her brutally with his rubber
truncheon. Hany women were bleeding heavily fron the blows and I saw
one of them collapse. She was thrown on to one of the carts and I never
saw her again. The carts thhn waved'off in the direction of LODZ and
the men were made to ftarch behiiid us. BIEBOW accompanied the transport
aJjAvj; saw torn beat and kick men who lagged behind. A Polish Jew named
SASZtVSKL was shot through the head by BIEBOW, as he could not walk fast
enough. I saw him collapse and his body thrown on to one of the carts.
I never saw kiisi again. JQr friend named B8RCH0LZ, a Polish Jew, was
also attacked by BIEBOW during the March and beaten so severely that he
collapsed and" bad to be put on to one of the carts. It so happend that-
he was made to share nr* room at the LODZ Ghetto and he died a few days
lathr as a consequence of the illtr•rats’ent by BIEBOW. I was present
when he passed away and his last words were "BIEBOW murdered me".
Another Polish' Jew who fell repeatedly*durinr the march was knocked about
by BIEBC',7 with the butt of a rifle, until fee collapsed and did not move
again. BIEBOW continued to push the rifle butt into the man's chest.
Eventually he was thrown on one of the- carts and I never saw him again<
5,	• I saw both SEIFEET and BIEBOW frequently at the Ghetto in
LODZ.	I was' working at the Tailor's-depot at Tokarzewskiego 18. SEJ.FEHT
often held inspections*there and many women were beaten by him in jay-
presence for no particular reason. BIEBOW always took part in the
frequent selections that took place in. 1942, 1943,	1944,-for transport
He personally selected men, women and children who were then taken away
and never seen or heard of again.

I was
Prisoner by the Germans on 12th September 1939 at ZEGREE, POLAND,
taken to the P. 0.1/4 Camp at MOLNAU from	where I escaped in	early	December
1939* I went home but was re-arrested	by the Germans the	same month	and
taken to AUSCHWITZ. In June 19^h4 I was transferred to BUCHENWALD and in
September 1944 to DORA NORDHAUSEM. In	the second week of	April	1945	I was
sent to RKLSEN where I was liberated on	15th April 1945*
2.	I have been taken to the HELSEN Detention Cells, where
during an identification parsde consisting of five men, I picked out the man
I know by the name of KBMFP. lie was an SS man at DORA NOEDHAUSEN and is
the man referred to in my deposition.
3.	KEMEF v/as responsible for a section of Blocks at DORA
N03DHAUSEN, this included Block 120, the one I lived in. This Block housed
about 450 prisoners of mixed nationalities, but the majority were Poles and
Russians, KEMEF used to come into our Block daily and select prisoners at
random, and then proceed to beat them brutally either with his fists or with
a rubber truncheon. He never stopped illtreating a prisoner before he had
drawn blood and it was a common sight to see prisoners collapse under his blows.
Many of those illtre&ted by KELIFF remained lying on the ground covered in blood
and had to be carried to the Revier afterwards. I myself was beaten by KEMFF
one day in early April 1945 because my bed was not very tidy, KEMEF hit me
savagely in the face with his fists and elbows and I bled from mouth and nose.
Later I found that he had knocked two of my teeth out.
4.	One day in late March or early April 1945, a few day's
before we left DORA NOEDHAUSEN, 50 Russians and Poles were hanged at the Camp,
because they had been overheard talking of the approaching Russian troops,
KEMEF was drunk on this occasion and made our whole Block parade to witness
the hanging. Ulilst this was being carried out he abused us continuously.

Deposition on oath of Mtzi PEEEDMAI1!^, female,, late of 8 Kosciusko ul., ^	#
PETHI.KOV, POLilND, and at present living at Room 34, Biocl?\7, HOHNE (HELSEN)^
Camp, GEffl/LANT, sworn before Captain Duncan ELLIS, East Surrey Regiment,
of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team at HOHNS Camp on	/*?&£
1.	I lived in PETRIKOV and worked in a furniture
factory 'for thd Germans until September 1944* Then the women of our
family -#ere sent to MVINSBSftCK and the male members were sent to
BUCHENWALD because we are Jews. On the 24th March 1945 I was sent to
HELS1N Concentration Camp where I was liberated on 15th April 1945*
2.	,	I have been shown a number^of photographs
and I recognise the wom^^showju as. No. ? ,	Photo graph FC/22 as an
SS woman at RavensbrucSy ^ "l' haVe’*no^ beentold that her name is
Gertrude HEISE,. I also recognise the man shown on Photograph DE/§
as be’ing the man in charge of all work at Ravensbruck. I did not
know his name , but have now been told that it is Fritz SURIN.
3;’	T 'hdvd seen SURIN at selections which he
often carried out with, and yithout, the camp doctor. These selections
took place every Sunday during the last'six weeks at PAVENSBRUCK, because,
owing to the Russian advance, AUSCHWITZ had been evacuated and many
people had been sent from AUSCHWITZ to PAVENSBEUCK.
4.	On these selections he used to beat us terribly,
mostly with his hands or sometimes with a rubber truncheon. when we
paraded for work he. brutally beat the weak people and often I saw
prisoners 'fall to'the 'ground under his blows and kicks and not move
again.' There was a special squad which came around after the parade and
took the bodies away. I must presume that they were dead because any
of the victims who were still alive were led away by their friends
when the. parade marched off. This special squad put the bodies onto e
cart and it was common knowledge in the camp that they were taken away
to be cremated. I never saw an;/ of them again.
5. ....... ’ ' 'Ohe'd^y in February 1945 my mother stood next
to me on the' parade ground. SURIN came along with the SS woman of our
Block 23 and selected women by pointing at them with his finger. He
pointed at‘my mother and the SS woman \ rote down her number. My mother
had to step out of the ranks and join a large group qf people who had
also been selected to be removed from the camp and, as was commonly known,
to be exterminated. When the parade was over we marched off the square,
my group went to the right and straight to work. The group in which my
mother stood had to march to the left towards the youth csjnp. I have never
seen my mother since, nor anyone else of that group, although I stayed
another six weeks in the camp.	I have every reason to believe that
these people were killed and cremated later on because rumours to that
effect were common in the camp.
6.	If any of the women selected were too weak to
go off the parade ground with the SS woman of Block 23, whose name I
do not know, she would grab the prisoner by the leg end drag her off
the square with her head bumping along on the ground. I have witnessed
that scene every day towards the end of our stay at Ravensbruck, as more
and more of the prisoners became weak through undernourishment.
7
This SS woman, together with SURIN, was in﻿charge of all working parties. She was about 33 years old, of medium
height and build, with blond hair hanging down to her shoulders, blue
eye-B. She could be called beautiful' and was .very energetic. Her rank
was Oberaufseherin and her job was Arbeitseinesis. ¥nenever she come -
to the working site she used to beat us terribly in the face with her
* * ~ - e''i’ ' - ^ <1 ' ' ' '
fists,
l > -,■	<•	V	'	c	Cl	d
8,	Hy work together with another woman consisted
of carrying a box with 50 kg of potatoes or coal over a distance of
.8 km, often through deep snow and with only three short rests. When”
this particular SS woman came out, we were not allowed to rest even
once..
9,	I had a baby aged 2^ years and it became ill.
The woman doctor, a prisoner herself, prescribed a medicine three
times and she told me that she chose this particular medicine because
she knew it was available in the camp. Every time I went to the SS
c^ief nurse who had to confirm the prescription, she looked at my
badge which marked me as Jewish and crossed out the prescription. My
baby died on 21st, Marsh 1945•

f. Deposition on oath pf Sala WHtSEOIF, female, late of Antonifcego 7,
TOlviASZOW, POLAND and at present living at Room 20, Block 26, HOME (BELSEN)
Camp, GERMANY, sworn before Captain Duncan'ELLIS, East Surrey Regiment,
of No.l War Crimes Investigation Teas-! at HOME Camp thisb^Wday of ^
January 1946.,
1.	In October 1940 I was living at TOMASZOW and on the orders
of the Gentians I had to ,move to the Ghetto. In May 1943 I was taken
to the BLIZYN Labour Camp, which was converted into a Concentration Camp
in December 1943« In June 1944 I was transferred to AUSCHWITZ and two
days later to? the HINDENBURG Coneontration Camp. In December 1941- I was
taken to BBLSEN, where I was liberated by the British on 15th April 1945.
2•or	On the evening of,27tk April 1942 my father, Michal
WSTSKOEF, a Polish Jew, went to visit the dentist, a Pole named FNIAK who
lived outside the Ghetto at Bartoscho Glowackiego. Jews were not allowed
to leave the Ghetto and to avoid detection ray father had removed the
markings,indicating his Jewish origin, from his clothes. Soon after he
had returned from his visit members of BLEAK's family came to our house
to warn ay father that HAAKE, who was a Gestapo Official and who lived
in the same street almost opposite F LAK'g house, had seen.; him there, that
PNIAK had been arrested by the SD and that they were now trying to trace
Hiy father.
3.	My father remained at home and at about 3 o'clock in the
morning we were woken up by shots in the street. Two Gestapo Officials
came into our house and ordered my father to dress. I went to the front
door and saw HAAKE, accompanied by the SD officials KEMP and BttTTICH,
waiting outside, they were all armed with revolvers. My father was taken
outside and immediately afterwards we heard, a shot. My brother and I
went into the street and we found my father lying in the street with a
bullet wound through his head, my brother extracted the bullet but my
father was dead.
4.	Meanwhile HAAKE, KEMP arid BBTTICH went ..from house to house
and called out different men, women, who were then shot dead on the spot.
Orders were then issued that the dead were to be left lying in the street
.j until 11 o'clock that morning when they were to be taken to a hall tit
Qrl, the Jewish .hospital pn the vV'iecznos^Strasse under the supervision of the
Jewish--doctor named MQPiTCOWICZ. During the morning of the 28th April
- • -1942 I, went to the office of the Jewish Council to enquire whether I could
• — take my father's body into the house. Whilst I was there the Polish
Ghetto Policeman, named D0MBR0SKI, arrived with a list of the Ghetto
inmates who had been murdered the night before. I learned then that the
number of those shot was 92. Theyincluded. nay friends K0SZE0WSEI,
HIRSCHPRIMG, Er.KON, Pr.HERZ, Dr. JUWILER, .ZEHKER BLUM and his wife and
DOMANOWTCZ and his wife, all Polish Jews. We buried 92 bodies in the
TOMASZOW Jewish cemetery, two days later. There were all persons ?»ho
had been shot on the night of 27/28th April 1942.
-V
5.	During the "Aussiedelung" of the Jewish Ghetto in November
1942 when the majoi-ity of the Jewishpopulation was rounded up by the SD
and sent off to extermination camps, all old and weak people and young
children were murdered by the SD personnel. We were confined to our
houses and so I was unable to witness what actually happened, but I heard
much shooting and the Jewish Council announced a few days later that
500 persons had been murdered by the SD on that occasion. I- t„ ok -fwaipt
in -Hnp Kn-.-inl ,vP	»n -j ra—-hhn	PpvnptFr-y. I was told
later by a number of persons who were left behind after the selection.
﻿that they had seen HAAKE take an active part in this wholesale massacre.
One morning in March 1943 the Jewish population of the
TOMASZOW Ghetto was ordered to a semble in the Pajkarsia Strasse.	K>Z'
Vnien we Arrived we had -t© line up and then HAAECK, BBTTIC.d, iCE!'.IP, hL’.iQ^R,
Oberstunafuhrer wlESE, Hauptsturmfidirer/THIELj’ AUGUST, JAiDI.MD of the
SD arrived by car. t The 'Eldest of the Jews* named BERNSTEIN was called
across and when: he returned told us that Jews were no longer allowed
to possess any money or valuables, that such must be surrendered imEied.ia.tely,
and that any person found hiding any valuables would be shot. T>fO
large baskets were then placed in front of the parade and we were told
to file past and throw: our possessions inside. The first ones to .do so
were the Polish Jews Chajifii PLATT, WOLCOWICZ, SAMSLSGN and another man
whose name I cannot remember. As soon as they had put tneir belongings
in the basket I saw KEMP shoot them down at close range; they fell to
the ground and remained lying there,in a pool of blood,without moving
again. "They were buried- in the TOMASZOW Jewish cemetery a few days
later. I also saw HAAKE beat people brutally with ms lasts, he hio
them in the face and I saw : iany men and women bleed from the nose and
mouth as a result of these beatings.

of
Major Prank Peter CAOLA.
Deposition on oath of Major Frank Peter CAOLA, Royal Artillery, of No.l
War Crimes Investigation Team, sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas
Humphrey TILLING, Royal Artillery, No.l War Crimes Investigation Team
at HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY, on	January 1946.
1,	No.l War Crimes Investigation Team has for some time
past bean, engaged In’cdlledting evidence at HOHNE (EELSEN) Camp from ex-
prisoners of various Concentration Camps-
« ' " \
2.	HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp is a large Camp occupied by
approximately 15,000 Displaced Persons of various nationalities, amongst
these are many former prisoners of BELSEN Concentration Camp, and a large
number of ex-prisoners who were formerly in one or more of the other
Concentration Camps set up by the Germans. These persons have been able
to rive valuable evidence regarding the conditions in such Camps.
During the past three months this Team has taken
sworn statements from approximately 200 witnesses at HOHNE Camp and in
cases where a witness has made specific allegations against former personnel
of a. Concentration. Camp it has net always been possible to ootain personal
identification of the accused even then-, th accused is in custody-
This is cMhfly due to the fact that the majority of the accused persons
are located in one or other of the 8 C.I.C's which are spread over the
British Zone and time has not permitted the taking of individual witnesses
to the C.I.C's for the such purpose. In these circumstances the methods
described in the following paragraphs have been used for identifying the
persons referred to in statements taken by personnel of this Team.
4.	Upon contact being made with a witness who wished to
make allegations against a named person, he or she would be shown a large
number of photographs of ex-concentration camp personnel and amongst which
would be a photograph of the person named by the witness. The book now.
produced to me marked FPC/l, was chiefly used for this purpose although in
some instances the witnesses were shown a number of loose photographs
similar to those contained in this book. For the purpose of reference
each photograph was given a serial number. In some cases this serial number
appears on the face of the photograph but otherwise the photographs were
unmarked. The ■■ itness would be asked to select the photograph of the
person named and if such selection was correct this was taxon as sufficient
identification and a statement would then be taken from the witness, and the
serial number of the photograph referred to in the witness' statement would
be the number of the photograph so selected.
In cases where a witness was usable to name a person
but was able to identify a photograph as being that of a person against
whoa he or she wished to give evidence the identification was checked by
asking questions of the witness regarding the nature ox the duties, r&rJc,
former location, the dates on "which the person concerned was alleged to have
been at such location etc. and provided that the witness' answers^agreed
with the history of the person concerned this was accepted as sufficient
identification.,
g.	With regard, to the photographs in series FC/l to
FC/ /&	, inclusive contained in exhibit FPC/l it will be seen that these
photographs each show three persons and for the purpose of witnesses
statements the person shown on the left of such photographs is feferred
to as No.l, the person in the centre No. 2 and the person on the right as﻿%
No*3.	In other cas.es vfhere >:tore than one person.appears on a
photograph the persons shown are numbered from left to right starting
with the nunber 1#

Aren JAKUBOTOCZ
Deposition on oath of Aren JAKUBOWICZ, male, late of
liX-Mickew'/za 8, LODZ, POLAND and at present living at Block 27,
Room 15, HOME (BELSEN) CAMP, sworn before Captain Myles LERNER,
Royal Artillery, of No.l War Crimes Investigation Team at HOHNE
Camp this day of January 1946.
1.	In September 1939 I was drafted into the Polish
Army as a Tank Driver. In early November 1939, when things
looked quit® hopeless for the Poles I deserted near KUTNA and
returned to my home at LODZ. In March 1940 German officials
appointed ®e their Driver and I had to live at Brunnerstrasse 19
WARTA, near LODZ. At the end of August 1942 I had to return to
my home at the LODZ Ghetto and lived there until August 1944,
when I was transferred to the BRIEDLAND Labour Camp near BRESLAU
where the Russians liberated me on 9th May 1945.
2.	I have been taken t© BELSEN DETENTION CELLS where
during an identification parade consisting of five men I picked
out the man I know by the name of SEIFERT. I have also been
shown a number of photographs and from these have picked out
the man on photograph DPS/l as being the man I know by the name
BIEBOW. Both are the men referred to in my deposition.
3.	In March 1940 I was detailed to become a Driver
for BIEBOW, SEIFERT and RICHTER! I had to move to WARTA and
from that time until the end of August 1942 frequently had to
drive these three officials at LODZ and to different ghettos
in the vicinity. I never accompanied them into the LODZ
ghetto as BIEBOW always drove himself on such occasions.
During 1940 I had to drive BIEBOW, SEIFERT and RICHTER to the
Jewish Communities in the different towns and villages
surrounding LODZ, where they arranged the formation of ghettos
and ordered all Jews to wear the star of David as a distinguish-
ing mark. They also made up working parties at the different
places and I often saw BIEBOW whip Jews and Jewesses brutally
on such occasions for no reason whatever. In July 1940
BIEBOW ordered a motor road to be built across the Jewish
Cemetery at PLASZKA! I myself saw how, on BIEBOW's orders
the grave stones were removed by Polish workers and how the
bodies of the dead were dug up and thrown about. In the same
month BIEBOW ordered the destruction of the Jewish cemetery
and the synagog at WARTA. The latter was dynamited and
gallows were errected on the spot.
4.	In March 1941 BIEBOW, SEIFERT, RICHTER and SCHWIND
paid a visit to the German Police station at WARTA. I went
inside with them as an orderly and after they^a^Jpeen drinking
for quite some time SEIFERT sent for the R&bba^and a Polish
photographer. The Rabbi had to uncover his sex organs on
BIEBOW’s order, and the Polish photographer then had to pull
out the hair in that region. He then had to take a
photograph of the Rabbi. SEIFERT then asked him whether he
wanted a shave. He pulled out a sharp knife and cut off the
Rabbi!s whiskers on one side together with the flesh underneath.
The Rabbi, who bled profusely, was then sent away.
6.	In March 1942 I was ordered by BIEBOW to pick
up 9 Jewish people at WARTA, who some weeks earlier had been
absent from the ghetto there for a fortnight. They included
my father-in-law Abraham HERZBERG, ay mother-in-law Hannah﻿PAGE TWO OP DEPOSITION OP Aren JAKUBOWICZ
HERZBERG, her sisters Machla and Bluma HER2BESG, all Polish
Jews. BIEBOW, RICHTER and'the Gestapo official TRETTENBACH
came with us and I had to drive the party to a wood at 'PIHAL!
There the nine had to dismount and stand near a newly dug
grave. They were shot down with automatic revolvers by the
three Germany, who then photographed them as they were lying
on the ground.	Several were still alive and I could see
them move but they were thrown into the grave,together with
the others, which was then filled up. I had to drive the
Germans back to WARTA and was told there that meanwhile SEIFERT
had ordered the hanging of a 16 year old Polish Jew named
HEPHER and that he had been present when this was carried out.
I myself was present at the banging.
6.	I was present during the 'Aussiedelung' of the
WARTA ghetto in August 1942. BIEBOW, SEIFERT and RICHTER
were in charge. The Jewish population^of the ghetto had to
assemble on a square near thi^iw^m^. ah workers
were then segregated and the remainder, some 700 people, were
taken into thJ’^cTiurch. I saw how they were given injections
by German nursing sisters, on BIEBOW's orders. At first
the injections did not seem to have any effect, but some hours
later when the people were made to mount lorries which had
drawn up outside,many of them were unable to do so and had to
be thrown on by the Polish drivers. The lorries drove off
with the 700 Jewish sen, women and children and on their
return the Polish drivers hold me that they had all been taken
to the crematorium at CHELM some 80 kilometres away and killed
there. The workers were taken to the LODZ ghetto. I
witnessed the following incident outside- the Polish Church.
BIEB0Y/ sheuted an order to a 75 year old Jewess named HOLTON!
The woman was quite deaf and did not hear. BIEBOW and SEIFERT
then pounced on her and both beat her brutally with short
heavy sticks. The woman collapsed and remained lying
motionless on the ground covered in blood. When I passed
the spot again some time later her body had been removed and
I never saw her again.
7.	On the day of the Aussiedelung^a number of
prominent ghetto citiyens, including the Rabbi and members
of the Council, were hanged on BIEBOW's orders. I had to
witness the hanging, which took place on the square where
the synagoge used to be and saw that BIEBOW, SEIFERT, and
RICHTER were present.
8.	I was then ordered to accompany a party of Germans
commanded by BIEBOW and SEIFERT, who went from house to house
to make certain that none of the ghetto population had stayed
behind. At the house of HIRSCHKOWICZ in the Backerstrasse
we found a woman and a newly born child hidden in a bed under
a blanket. One of the Germans went outside and reported this
to BIEBOW and SEIFERT. I had remained in the room with the
woman and saw SEIFERT come in. He lifted the blanket and
fired a shot into the woman's chest. We all left then but
■che German police and I returned a few minutes later and found
the woman still alive. One of the Germans went outside again
and returned this time with BIEBOW. BIEBOW was swearing as
he came in and I saw him lift the blanket and shoot the woman
through her sex organs. He then picked up the newly born
child and threw it on the floor where it reaiained lying quite
still.
9.	Our party then proceeded along the Chelsestrasse.
Near the Police station ther we saw the Polish Jew FRIEDE
run from one house to another.	SEIFERT called him across
and made him bend down. I then saw him shoot FRIEDE through﻿PAGE THREE OE I'EPOSITIOH OF Aren JAKUBOWICZ!

the back of the neck ith a revolver. PRIEEE collapsed
and remained lying on the ground in a pool of blood. I and
two other en were detailed, by SEIFERT, to bury his at the'v>•^vs,
Jewish Cejaetery.
10. -L	The next day I had to move into the LODZ ghetto,
Ov-Mickewsza 8. BIEBOW arranged for me to be employed as a
tram d'river in the ghetto and in addition I had to maintain
SEIEERT's car. A few days after my arrival at LODZ, the
first Aussiedelung there took place. Everybody had to
remain indoors for a week. One day during that week I
looked out of the window of my house and saw^ a man lean
out of a window of the third floor of Mickewsza t§, SEIFERT
was walking along the street and I saw hia draw his revolver
take aim and then fire at the man. He must have hit hi®
because I saw the man hurtle down into the street below, where
he remained lying quite still. If SEIFERT's shot had not
killed him outright then the fall from the third floor on
to the street most certainly did.

3.	At DORA NORDHAUSEN, KEMPF was in charge of a number of Blocks,
including Block 138, the one I lived at. There were some 450 men in my
Block, mostly Poles and Russians and KELPF often used to come in and beat
prisoners at random with his fists, elbows or, more frequently, with a
heavy rubber truncheon. He never ceased hitting a prisoner before he bled
profusely and had collapsed. Men who had been illtreated by KEMPS' were
usually left lying,in a pool of blood,on the ground and had to be carried
to the Revier later. Many of these did not return and I never saw them
again.
4*	Every day during Appell KEMPS' stood behind our ranks and if
any prisoner spoke or moved he pounced on him and hit him savagely with
his heavy rubber truncheon. He usually hit prisoners over the head
making them bleed heavily. Prisoners often collapsed under the brutal
blows and had to be carried to the Revier. Many of them did not come back
and were never seen again.
5*	One day in November or December 1944 I was working in the
Camp and KEMEF was with our party. A Russian, who was living in my Block,
picked up a turnip. KEMPF saw this and I saw him attack the Russian
hitting him savagely over the head with his rubber truncheon. The Russian
collapsed, bleeding heavily from the head and face, KEMEF then kicked the
man with his heavy boots and he did not move again. Two prisoners were
detailed later by a Capo to take the Russian to the Revier. In the evening
I was told by a friend of the man, another Russian who lived in our Stock,
that he had been to the Revier to visit his friend and had been taken
to his dead body.

X.	When the war broke out I was living at SRZSZINY. I as
a Jew and as such was compelled to J.ive in the part of BEZEZIMY which had
Wn converted into a ghetto. On 17th May 1942 I was moved to the Ghetto
at LODZ, Zawisza 38. In August 1944 I was sent to AUSCHWITZ and three
days later to the GLEIWIT2 Labour Camp. In January 1945 I was transferred

The first time I saw BISBOU was in the
IZINY and ordered the Jewish Council to

be sent array in the near future. A list
containing the names of some 1500 elderly Jews was compiled and about two

EBOU’s directions, the men were loaded on

people and take them to the gate c
present at the gate when, under BI---- -
to trucks and driven away. None of them were ever seen or heard of again.
1U
;+>	in July 19^i-l a written order signed by BIE.B0W was receiv'd
b*r the Jewish Council stating that 130 men had to report to the ArALDBHLEDLh
Labour Camp, about 25 kilometres from LODZ. I was put in charge of the
transport and remained-with the men as their chief. At WALDFEIEDEN we wave
employed on cutting turf and the produce of our labours were supplied to
BIEBON and the Landrat of the LODZ District, whose name I have forgotten;
they used to sell the turf as fuel# It v/as corunou kncrrledge that the uhole
scheme 'n.d been originated by BIEBOff and that he was responsible for the
caap. Conditions there were terrible. The food we received, a small
quantity of bread daily, was quite insufficient as ’■Ye had to work extremely
hard. The German guards ff-rom. the LODZ Chet-te used to ill treat us
frequently and I have seen a. number of men shot by the.1, for no panticula^
reason." ^ HIE30W often visited WALDFRIEDEN and was aware of what went on.
After three months, 80 men from the on inal 130 had diedt-or<^^hg^^fa
nurdered.	BISBOW then approached the Jewish Council at BJTidZINy e&d
.'^fe^Tto return'the remaining fifty -len for the sum of 50,000 marks, and
two golden watches. The price was paid and what was left of the
V/ALDFSIEDEN transport returned to BRZEZINY in October 1941. he were m a
terrible state due to undernourishment and sickness and within two weeks of
our return 25 of the fifty had also died.
5,	in March 1942 the Jewish Council gave large quantities
of £0ld and jewels to 3IEB0W personally in exchange for his promise to leave
the Ghetto undisturbed. At the beginning of May 1942 BIEBON paid us
another visit and informed the Jewish Council that the Ghetto would oe
liquidated within the next few days. On 10th Lay 1942 3IEB0N cane again
and infomed us that all mothers, who had children up to ion years of age
would be exterminated together with then and that tne same fate would﻿EAGE 'TWO OF ESFOSITIOr: OF Gedalie FICIS,

befall all those over 35 years of e&e and those unable to work. On 14th
May 1942 we found the Ghetto surrounded by arriefi sentries. At 3.30 p.o.
HBGKEEj the BEZEZIWY; Gestapo Official cane inside with a written order
signed by EIEBOW that by 5 p.n. all mothers with their children up to
ten years of age and all those over 35 years of age had to assemble on a
neutral stretch of land between the Ghetto and the town. The order
stated that if thjis was not complied with several hundred Jews would be
shot at oner.. The Jewish Police under my directions proceeded then to
Around up those asked for and by five o'clock some 600 children and 1400
adults were present at the place specified.	When I arrived at the
scene I saw SEE BOW, SEIFERT, the Gestapo official	and^il^HTER.
THe Jews were then made to line upend I had to aeeorapony HEIiSOW- ■a.sTae
the ;;ood looking -.omen to one side
and all those who did not look so well and the elderly people to the
other. We, that is the Jewish Police, were then ordered to take the
children from the good looking worsen over to the other side. Then
together with the Germans we Had to take everybody into a building, Swinta
Anny 14, which was then locked up.
6.	Towards the end of the selection si"saw a woman named
LEHN2H, a Polish Jewess, sneak away with her six week old baby. She
went down the basement steps of a nearby house, evidently trying to hide.
SEIFFIT, who had been inactive so far, must have seen her : et away for he
took two of my policemen and together they went down to the basement.
They came back wit’ the woman and her child and marched her to a point
about 20 metres from where I was standing. SBIFEET then drew his revolver
and fired one shot into the child and then two rounds into the woman's
chest at close range. They fell to the ground and remained lying there
quite still, covered in blood. I heard SEIFEET then tell the Jewish
policemen that they must not mention the incident to anyone in the Ghetto.
7.	y/e, that is the Jewish Police, then received orders to
report outside 14 Swinta Anny at three a.m. the following morning. Wien
we'arrived I saw that Many lorries had drawn up outside the building. BIEBOh,
SEIFERT, SICHTEIi and the Gestapo Official FUCHS were present. BIEBOW was
in charge of a. number of Germans who I subsequently learned cane from the
LCBZ Ghetto. JIEBGF told us that we had ten minutes during which to load
the people in the house on to the waiting; trucks and the Germans and
ourselves went inside under the leaver sain of SETFi.-dT* I remember SEIFnJT
well. He wore a brown leather coat and carried a heavy leather whip.
Ye first of all went into the part of the house where the goodlooking
women, with their children, had been put. The Germans,, who appeared to
be drunk, hit the women savagely with rifle butts and truncheons so that
many collapsed covered in blood and the children were torn away from them
and thrown on to the waiting trucks.	SEIFERT behaved like a xi&dnan.
He hit women indiscrinately with either the butt of his revolver or the
handle of his whip. I saw him beat the Polish Jewess named SCHIJLMAIT, who
collapsed under the vicious blows inflicted on her head, SEIFERT kicked
her as she was lying on the ground and I a» sure he would have killed her
had I not pulled her away into a corner by her hair. SEIFERT then beat up
the Polish Jewess named BE.RCH0LZ until she collapsed and remained, lying
on the floor in a pool of blood. She had refused to part with her.child.
As she was lying on the ground crying in agony, SEIFEET kicked her viciously
in the stomach wit his heavy boots. After the children of the goodlooking;
women, and some of the women who had collapsed, had been put on to the
trucks, we had tc load up all the not so good looking ones with their
fVU children, and all elderly people. I, together with W of ay policeman,.
were then ordered to accompany the transport to the GALEU'IIK railway station.
We arrived there at about 5 a. •„	Soon afterwards BIEB0V;, SEIFER? ,the
Gestapo official FUCHS,and RICHTER, arrived by car.	3IEB0W was
flU accompanied by about half a dozen Gersan^somen. He ordered the drivers
of the lorries to draw up about 10 metres from the railway trucks. The
Jewish police were then told by BIEB0W to throw the children mto the trucks*
We were*not allowed to carry them but had to throw them the distance of more﻿PAGE THEBE OP DEPOSITION OP Gedalie PUKS.
I ,	"V^So to	...	.
I• L-' than Jm\ netre-s into the trucks, I tried to ignore the oraer and
proceeded to carry a four week old baby towards one of the railway trucks,
BTEBOd rushed across and hit the'baby over the lead with the handle of his
whip. The child's head split wide open and its blood and brains splashed
about. I let it drop and BIEBCSW -then gave me three savage blows across
the face with his whip, Ny ear split open and blood poured from the wound.
After this incident we tried to threw the children into the trucks but
after a short while we tired, and could not throw that far any mere. Some
of the children therefore dropped on the hard ground between us and the
trucks and I say/ the heads of a number of these split open from the impact.
3IIB0W and the German women with him were highly amused when this
happened and they roared with laughter. The Germans now joined in throwing
the children across to the trucks but soon that became Monotonous for
them and I saw them then anus® themselves by getting hold of some of
the younger children by their legs and tear them apart before throwing
them into the trucks. The German women, encouraged by BIEBOW also joined
in; they got hold of children, carried them across to the truck and smashed
their heads in before throwing them inside, lieahwhile	^n^agother
party of Germans unloaded tie women and elderly people’ and^maSe tnew mount
the train. Those who did not rim across fast enough or .ere somewhat
slow in mounting were thrown into, small pools of water and the Germans
kicked and trampled them to death. Those still alive after the illtreatrnent
were shot dead. SEIFEST took an active part in all this and I saw him
shoot a number of people who never moved again. There were about 50 dead
adults lying abo t after the others had been loaded up and we had to throw
them into the trucks. Then we were made to pick up some 40 or more
children, who were lying on the ground cither dead or with broken limbs.
They were all thrown into the trucks which were then sealed. Nothing
more was ever heard or seen of these people again. The Germans now
started to beat us,	SEIFEHT played a prominent part in $^tandJ^aw

one of ny men had sane ribs broken and we all bled from some wound inflicted
by the Germans, The Germans then made us do 'sports'. We had to
mount and dismount the lorries, drop on the ground and then get up in
quick succession. Then we were taken back to the Ghetto. We arrived
there between 10,00 and11.00 a.m.

again and BIEBOW, 'SEIFERT, RICHTER and the Gestapo official FUCHS oaae in-

After we had left BRZEZINY all elderly people had to dismount
and march behind the carts, whilst the younger people were allowed to ride.
Whoever fell behind was shot dead by the Germans on the spot and the elderly
people were beaten up continuously. I saw two old Jews thrown down a water
well by the Germans,	BIEBOv.1, SEIFrRT, RiCHTRR and the Gestapo official
PUGHS did not accompany the carts but arrived by car soon after we had
reached GATJCTT.yTK station. BIE30W ordered everyone to line up. In-order
to avoid incidents I went up to him and asked whether I, together with'V
-jwssSe, could do the sorting out. BIEBOW agreed and we then aade all
•workers move to one side. Whilst this was going on the Germans started
to beat up elderly Jews and Jewesses and SEIFERT took an active part in
this. He was the first to draw his revolver and I saw him fire into a
group of Jews. He then beat women brutally with his heavy whip, mostly
beating their chests. Many collapsed and SEIFERT then kicked them with
his heavy boots. He started to beat my mother, a Polish’Jewess named
Refka FUKS, but let go of her after I had intervened. After everybody
had been loaded on to the train I counted 16 dead lying about^i poglg^of

and after a few hours people, especially woraen, began to collapse. The train
remained at GALKIE/IK station for lr- hours. A number of people went and
bey,, ed the Germans guarding us to shoot than. The next day we arrived at
LODZ. BIEBOW was at the station when we detrained, I saw that many men and
woraen had died during the journey and their dead bodies were thrown on the
platform. Those still alive -were taken to a special camp. On 19th.May 1942

qt	At the LODZ Ghetto I again became a member of the Jewish
Police and as such, often encountered BIEBQV7,-GlilFEBT, the Gestapo official
FUCHS, HICHTSR and other Ghetto officials. Since the curfew imposed during
the times when different transports were made up for exteyAination did not
appl,r to the Jewish police, I was able to see what ViappeWi at LODZ and also
several murders committed by BISBOW. There were many 'Aussiedelungen', that

10.	During the ’Aussiedelung1 of September 1942 BIEBOW, had
given the .en in charge of their respective houses permission to remain at home
whilst the others were being sorted. I, and other Jewish policemen, accompanied
BIEBOW and the Gestapo official FUCHS, along the KLINARSKA. In the yard of
No.20 we saw an man, obviously the man in charge of the house, sweeping up
the yard. BIEBOW drew his revolver and fired at the man, who fell to the.
ground. I saw that he had hit his arm. BIEBOW then told one of the Jewish
policemen to go up to the old man and enquire whether he had hit him properly.
The policeman did so and reported that the ran had said 'Yes' , ana that ne^was
still alive. BIEBOU and FUCHS then went up to the man and both fired several
rounds into his head and body.
H.	w« then walked towards CZAE1\TICM'KIEG0 where some selections
were taking place. Near there was a horsedrawn cart filled with Jews, already
selected for extermination. Two young Jewish firemen evidently did not see
our party approach and were helping some aJclnriy-people to fake their escape.
BIEBGU called then; across and both he and FUCHS fired taeir pistols ac the.-.! snd
also at the Jews on the cart. There were about a dozen shots and I counted
afterward 6 or 7 bodies, including the two firemen lying in the street. They
were all covered in blood and did not move again.
12,	During one of the 'Aussiedelungen' in 1943, when 1000 people
had to assemble at CZAHMICEI-JEGO for extermination, only 950 were present. ^ In

Deposition on oath of Jan PASIEOZHY, male, late of Zdzwiattow, POLAHD. and
at ore sent living at Block 15, Room 27, HOUNE (BPLSM) CAvP, GiMMY, sworn
befifire Captain Myles LESttBR, Royal Artillery of No.l War Crimes Investigation
Team at KOHME (bHLSEN) CAP this -jv* day of January 1946.
1.	I lived at ZDZWIARTOW until 11th November 1942 when I was
arrested by the Gestapo because I had been working with the resistance
movement. ^ I was taken to the prison at ZAMOSZ for six months and in 1943
was taken to the prison at LUBLIN where I stayed until May 1943 • I was
then sent to the Concentration Camp at KAIDANEK where I stayed until the
end of July 1943. I arrived at BUCHENWALD in August 1943 and stayed there
one month. X was transferred to DORA NORDHAUSEN on ^8th August 1944 and
remained there until I v/as taken to BEL SEN on 7 th April 1943* a was liberated
at BET.SEN on Ipth April 1945.
2.	On January- 21st 1946 I was taken to PINEWOOD GAOL and shown
four men. I picked out one whom I uuew ab a Blockleader at DORA CAMP. I am
now told his fame is Yfilhelm KS.iPB’.
3,	KH.PP was a SS Blbcfeie-ader at	CAMP. I saw him on the
working site and every evening on roll call. He was the worst of all the SS
men X knew at DORA. \7hen KEMPF saw a prisoner who in his opinion worlc©d
too slowly he called the man aside and gave him still heavier work to do.
Yfhen the prisoner could not cope with it, he started beating him. The man
had to stand to attention while KEMPF hit him in the stomach and when the
man fell forward he-hi ; him with his fist in the face. He did this until
the prisoner fell to the ground. Then KEiPP continued to kick him with
his boots. The victim was then taken away to the sickoay.	I was in the
punishment squad for a year and I saw things like that happen every day,
especially to the weaker men who could not work so fast. The victims were
of different nationalities, but especially Poles, Russians, Belgians, French
Dutch and Czechs.
4.	A clerk was attached to the Punishment Squad . He was
Frenchman who spoke several languages and his job was to compile lists and
do all Sorts of clerical work. One day in Spring 1944 KEMPF came to the
site and saw this clerk sitting there. He said to the Frenchman 'You are
a Jew. Get up and go to work.’ The Frenchman said 'I am a clerk and have to
writ?’these lists'. KSMPF said 'You are a Jew and you have.to work too'.
\ He gave the man a wheelbarrow and detailed four men to load it with gravel.
Th^e Frenchman had to wheel the barrow at the double up a^hill anti tip it
there. There was no reason for this work as we a'cttuaj.ly nad uo lay rails
and this work was only meant to torture that Frenchman. KELPF ran along
behind his victim and beat him with a stick whilst the man ran. s/nen he
came back KEMEF made the man lie down and then get up continuously whilst the
four men refilled the barrow and then he sent him up the hill again. That
went on for a long time until the clerk did not have the strength to carry
on any more. Then KEMPF hit him in the storaach with his fist and when
the man collapsed kicked his body with his boots until he was covered in
blood and had to be taken away to the sickbay where he had to stay for one
and a half months.
3#	Whenever KELPF caught a prisoner with a potato or turnip in
his pocket he called the man aside, hit him with the fist in.the stomach
and in the face and then ordered a Capo to hold the man, head downwards.
He hit him with a spade handle on the buttocks ana reported the man s
number on return from work so that he received another punishment of 25
strokes in camp. That was an occurrence in the punishment squad which I
sa happen daily.﻿We had to lay rails-, and the order of ifche German
civilian for- man was that 9 men should carry each rail. KEMEF
said that six men were sufficient for that and tool: three men away.
The civilian foreman protested but KiiiPF said that he as an SS
man had.to give the orders. The six men struggled with the heavy /
load'and. staggered under'the 16 meter long rails but could not
carry ft far. When the rail dropped to the ground several , .en
were hurt and had their feet crushed and had to be taken to the
sickbay.
7.	I remember that at that time 45 men were in the -
punishment squad. After two weeks work there were only 12 men
left -through the terrible treatment received by the prisoners
off KEMPF. The remainder war* in the re ier and I do not know how
many died there.

Camp this hay of January 1946*
1.	I lived at LUBLIN until 1939 when I was called up for
the Polish Army. I served in the campaiyn until I was taken prisoner on
29th September 1939> in WARSAW. I was in various German Prisoner of War
camps and escaped in March 1944. In May 1944 I was recapturei ; ur 1
tsicen to DOHA Concentration Camp where I had to stay for two weeks. After
DORA had got in touch with my last Prisoner of War Camp at NEU BHANDENBUEG,
I was sent back there and stayed there until the liberation by the British
on 1st May 1945•
2.	On 16th January 1946 I saw a German man in the office of
the Polish Defence Cojnpany at HOME CAMP and I recognised him as being
an SS Blockleader from DORA Concentration Gamp. I am now told that
his full name is Wilhelm KEMFF.
3.	During the time I was at DORA I saw this SS Blockleader
cruelly beating prisoners, consisting of Poles, Russians,Frenchmen, on
various occasions. On one occasion especially, I saw him grab a prisoner
by the coat lapel and him in the stomach and the man collapsed. On
other occasions I saw him kick prisoners with his hoots.
4.	One da;/when 30 Poles and Russians had been hanged KEMP]?
said to me and others of my squad "Do you see these Polish swine hang? You
will hang soon too:.

January 194-6.
1,	l lived at RADOM until November 1942 when I was arrested
by the Gestapo because I was a Polish Reserve officer and suspected of
underground activities. Two months I was kept in the prison at RADOM
and in January 1943 was taken to MAIDANBK Concentration Camp. I stayed
there until July 1943 and was then sent to BUCH3N, AID. On September 4th
1943 I was sett to DORA Concentration Camp. After 18 months at DORA I
was taken to BELBEN Concentration Camp on 4th April 1945 and I was liberated
there on 15th April 1945*
2.	I was in the office of the Defence Coy. at HOME Camp when on
January l6th 1946 a German was brought in by two Polish civilians. I
recognised him immediately as an SS Blockleadsr from DOM whom I had seen
daily there for 18 months. In DORA I knew only his first name Willi, now
I have been told that his fully name is Wilhelm KEMPF.
3,	KEMPF held the rank of Rottenfuhrer and his position in the
Camp was Block leader. He spoke Polish very well■and therefore listened
to our conversation and reported us often. In that respect he was much worse
than all the other German guards. Many prisoners were put into the cells
through him. I have often seen him search men and if he found any small
article, like potatoes or other food, he beat them with a stick, kicked them,
or forced there to do exercises until they were completely exhausted. Whenever
he met men on the road or saw them at work he would beat them indiscriminately
with the stick which he always carried with him,
4.	i was working in a tunnel in the camp. Our daily wBkktthere
lasted 12 - 16 hours and on our return we had to erect huts in the Camp, KSMPF
would be there continually abusiiv and beating us.
felt it for about
5
three weeks afterwards and at first thought that my bones nad been broken.
I have often seen sick or weakened prisoners who could not work
6
fast enough for him, beaten and kicked by him until they collapsed unconscious.
It was one of his cruel habits to beat them when they used the latrines or to
push them in the latrine buckets.

1. It is oonfirKaad that the witncuaes umdei' reference are

(a)	Capt. Georg V/iskidenshy is witii the Hungaid n
Troops in Belsen;
(b)	kiui/Lt. Desso Bacaujlaici ht^s deserted frora tlie
Il-ongarian. Troops in Belsen.
2. In this connection it is once -.ore subratted tlint in
the particular light of the continued desertion of wanted
personnel, especially officers, from the ranks of the
Hungarians in Belson, sonic degree of action should bo taken
in the light of tills Unit’s letters addressed to D. J. .G.,
ref; SC/Vll dated 13 Jun 45 and 9 Jul 45 & TC/B/17 dated
21 Jul 45. The situation as previously set out in the
letters referred to remains virtually unchanged, although tliis
Unit has reason to believe that orders ameliorating matters
vrere in fact issued some time in July by 30 Goi'ps.
3« There is every reason to believe that unless action
be taken further deselrtionsKill occur. It is believed that
appnd&Jftately 15;.'' of tlia Hungarian personnel have now so
deserted and tJssre is little doubt that among these an
appreciable proportion were War Gririnals.

8 Dec 45•
Dear

I am, to put it mildly, somewhat disturbed, with regard to
Hungarian cases which appear to be coming up for trial. This Week two of
Lieuts. PATO & UJVARY,were tried by a Military Court at Celle on charges
of murder and both acquitted,,
the
them.
With regard to PATO, we only had two witnesses who_were
Hungarian soldiers and these were called in person by the _prosecution but
acoarently were tied in knots by the defending oliicer, with the result .
as mentioned above that PATO was acquitted. This was a possibility in this
case which we had foreseen.
With regard to UJVARY, however, the case is most alarming_
with regard to the other cases coming on in the future. I want to emphasize
that the information I am giving you about this case is not entirely first
hand; it wag gaftared by Staff Serjeant Woodcock of tins Team who was ceiled
as a witness in this case and who, therefore, was not in the court.throughout
the proceedings, but he was able to gather quite a lot of information from
the court orderly. From our records the following witnesses seemed to be
essential for the prosecution to call: -
J. NAG-Y
G. PORCIS
V.FRBUHDLICH
A. SOLYOM
L. HETEHYI
A. HODOR
In fact according to the copy of instructions for the
bringing to the court of witnesses, the following list shows the witnesses
for the prosecution who were asked for:-
G. PORGIS
Oapt. WISKIDHI'ISKY
J. TQMSCMYI
M. SULI
L. HETMYI
J. FORGACH
The following comments are made with regard mo
this:-
Staff Serjeant Yfoodcook assures me that, to the oest oj. his
knowledge, the only evidence offered by the prosecution v/ag:	an
Affidavit YriTich was read of Tilma Freundlich, (2) Evidence by Woodcock
himself, apparently with regard to identification, and, (3) Captain
Georg Wiskidensky. Captain Wiskidensky appears in our records as a
witness for the defence of UWTARY and it is, therefore, not understood
why he should be called for the prosecution. With regard to the rest of the
witnesses that the prosecution asked for, PORCIS was in court but never
called, TOMSANYI and SULI were, in my opinion, completely unnecessary
and in fact were also not called. HETENYI was also in court but not
called; FORGACH against whom evidence exists as to War Grimes vas also
court but not called.
I have ascertained that KAGY, SOLYCM and HODOR ^ at this
moment. available in Belsen and could quite easily have been called y
prosecution.
Apparently the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence.
I do not know who "was responsible for deciding on how the prosecution was
to be presented and I hesitate, with only scrappy information at my disposal,
to say the case was presented wrongly. However, the fact.retrains. v,na<>
the above it is obvious that,unless some unknown explanation^ exists as ^,o I
the reason for the prosecution adducing such meagre evidence wherf plentxfuJr ■>
evidence exists, the affair lias been mismanaged at some leve L. 4 DEC 194*
-1-﻿-2-
sending you this information because if this is a sample of what may happen
in the future I think that serious consideration ought to be given as to
whether the remainder of the Hungarians should be tried*
The local effect here has been enormous. My contacts with
the Hungarian soldiers state that their attitude may be summed up in the
words *' This is too easy, the English obviously can1t do anything about
us at alii“ Although I have no proof I fear that this will have the most
serious effect on the procuring of evidence Yd.th regard to Concentration
Camp Guards. The unwillingness of witnesses to come forward for various
reasons had at last been partially overcome but I anticipate that this
may result in a couplete drying up of all further evidence from witnesses
here.
A further alarming side to the matter is that PATS) at least
is known to have been allowed to return to this Camp. I have arranged that
he shall be imprisoned here for his own protection as I understand he v/as
looking last night for the two -witnesses who gave evidence against him.
Is it possible in the future, if a Hungarian is acquitted, for him to
be removed as far as possible from this Camp and not permitted to return ?
I suggest most strongly that, if it is possible, the ideal -would be for any
such persons to be repatriated to Hungary at once.
Incidentally, 22 witnesses were called for the defence
including the Hungarian Padre, who is believed to have said in court
that this Team had imprisoned these Hungarians, had refused to allow anyone
to see them, and had prevented them fran finding o$fc what the charges were
against them. This in substance is true as the Hungarians have been
considered by this Team as being on ’all fours' with the S3 guards at
BELSEN, none of whom, of course, were formally charged, but only interrogated
if' it was thought that any useful purpose could be served by so doing.
Another aspect of the aase, of course, is the possibility
that at future Hungarian trials, no Hungarian soldier witnesses will come
forward to give evidence for two reasons: firstly, the idea that it will
be useless to do so because every Hungarian will be acquitted, and,
secondly, the understandable fear that the acquitted person ’will be
enabled to return here and. avenge himself if* he so wishes.
I do not know on what charges, UJYARY and PATO stood trial!.
It might be that UJVARY was only charged with one case of murder. If this
be so, I do not know whether it is worth sending him for trial on the
other incidents which are alleged in the depositions against him.
For your information the Numbers of the depositions which
we considered were useful against UJVARY axe:-
227	Janos NAGY
228	Gyula PBRCIS
230 Yilma PKEUNDLIOH
239 Aladax SDDYCM
243 Laszlo HETENYI
283 Antal HODOE
Exhibits 227 , 228 and 23O were forwarded to you under cover
of WC/B/8 dated 14 July 1945 , Exhibits 239 and 243 under ref YC/B/ dated
17 July 1945 and 283 was sent to you on 18 Aug 45 under Ref WC/B/8.
I would appreciate
your ideas on this whole matter in
take in the future.

With reference to ra^ telephone conversation to-day, Rhine
Array are trying a Hungarian officer for the killing of a I^snanian
at Belsen on or about the date when Belsen was liberated, naMly
15th A Til, 1945. It has been alleged that Rumania was at that
tine a co-belligerent and consequently that the Ruraanian subject
was an allied national. I should say that the person accused
wms a member of the 1st Hungarian Tank Regiment, which Regiment
was acting as guard at Belaen under carders of the v'ehrnmcht.
Gould you please vsrite direct to 1XTAG, Rhine Assay, on behalf
of the Foreign Office, stating on what date Ttumnia became a
co-belligorent, so that this letter can be produced in court.
As the trial is to take place next week, the natter is of
3arse urgency.

8th December
S.W.l.
, 1945.

I etn directed by Mr. Secretary Bevin to inform yen
that the office of the Judge Advocate General at
the war Office have requested that an official
statement should be furnished to you by this
department regarding the status of Roumania. It is
understood that this question is material to the
trial of a Hungarian officer for the killing of a
Roumanian at Belsen and that it has been suggested
that Roumania was at that time a co-belligerent and
the Roumanian in consequence an allied' national.
2. I am to state that on or about the 23rd
August, 1944, the Roumanian Government issued an
order to the Roumanian forces that they were henceforth
to engage in hostilities against Germany and
Hungary and to co-operate with the Allied forces,
and that this order was duly carried out; and also
that under the subsequent Armistice terms, signed
on the 12th September,1944, a specified number of
Roumanian missions were to be placed at the disposal
of the Allied High Command.
3. I am to add however that the above mentioned
order of the Roumanian Government was regarded as
constituting a purely unilateral action on their
part which, while it might affect the position as
between Roumania and Germany and Hungary, did not in
any way alter the status vis-a-vis the Allies or
affect/
The Deputy Judge Advocate General,
B.A.G.R.﻿* /
affect her position of an enemy state in
relation to them. Similarly nothing
in the Armistice terms was held to affect
Roumania's status as an enemy.
4.	The position therefore is that, pending
the conclusion of a final peace treaty or other
action equivalent thereto, Roumania is, and
always has been, an enemy state and Roumanian
subjects enemy nationals. At no time has
Roumania had Allied status or Roumanian subjects
been regarded as Allied nationals.
5,	Fur-thermore, in view of the; fact that
Roumania's original engagement in hostilities
against her former allies -Was regarded as
concerning herself and them alone, and that her
obligation under the Armistice terms to furnish
troops for the use of the Allied High Command
was in the nature of a corvee imposed on her as
a condition of the grant of an Armistice,
Roumania has never been accepted by the Allies
as a co-belligerent in any sense which would
alter her status in relation to them.

JJI"	ed
1.	I have instructed Capt Evelyn, who aci/as prosecutor in the
case of the above-named alleged war criminals, to forward you a
report in this case.
2.	’in view of the criticism of Lt.Col Tilling I ffOuld bring to your
notice the following matters in relation to the trial which I
observed as Legal Member of the court
(a)	To the best of my knowledge Lt.Col Tilling did not attend at
the trial.	It is, therefore, a little difficult to understand
how he canes to be in a position to criticise the conduct of
the prosecution.
(b)	With regard to the trial of Lt BATO the defence succeeded in
cross-examination in discrediting the prosecution witnesses,
who were Hungarian soldiers, to such an extent that it became
apparent that no one could possibly be convicted of any
offence upon their evidence. In addition the defence proved
that the Hungarian Army were in a mutinous state at the time
when these witnesses made their original statements and were
prepared to say more or less anything against their officers
if by that means they would get rid of them.
(c)	With regard to the trial of Lt UJVARY it appeared from
enquiries made by the prosecutor before trial that one of the
main prosecution witnesses was referring to an entirely^
different incident, and upon my advice the prosecutor did not
call this witness. Apart from evidence in relation to﻿-2-
oertain oraers" ^bich upon the defenbe set'up ^:ere.
irrelevant, the case now depended upon an affide^w
and the identification of the accused by the witness
who swor'e the affidavit, which was carried out in an
unsatisfactory manner.
<> *
3. It would appear that certain of the matters set out in
para 2(b) and (c) above might without great difficulty have
been ascertained when the case was first investigated, and
that it was most unfortunate that they were not disclosed
before the trial.

BACK,
28 geo 45.
Dear
The Group Captain, as you know., is now on leave and I have arrived in this
office during his absence. I have seen your letter to him under reference
VJC/B/17 of 8 Deo 45 regarding the trials of PATO and UJV/iHy.
The report of the prosecuting Officer has now been received.
With regard to PATO, it appears that your two Hungarian udtneases, aged 17
and 18, were cross examined at very great length, four and Ss hours respectively.
The Prosecuting Officer observes that on the conclusion not only had they contradicted
each other on veiy material points but also themselves. I see free your latter
that you had foreseen this posibility and therefore were not surprised at the result
of this oase.
With regard to TSTVAHT , I have locked at your depositions and see that the
evidence of the witnesses nominated by you are divided into two categories.
Pirst, there are four witnesses, as to shooting, MAGY, POHJIS, MSTJHLliIOH and HODGR.
The other witnesses, SQLYOIi, 1ISTENYI, T01SGAHYI, SIM and P0BGM3H, do not mention
the shooting but give evidence only as to the issue of certain’ ciders to sentries.
Of the first four it appears tliat the depositions relate to four different incidents;
atany rate, their evidence does not appear sufficiently precise about relevant details
of the crime to substantiate corroboration. I set out the details below
as follows;-
NAGY - mentions "On the second day that we were on guard .....
at this time there was a big crowd of prisoners around the cook-house. When
Lieut. Ujvary saw this, he took out his pistol and fired into the crowd until his
magazine of seven bullets was ersply. I saw several people fall to the ground
but was sent away by Lieut. TJjvary into the kitchen before I could see whether ary
had been killed or wounded ....... A Hungarian woman prisoner asked me -shy the
Lieutenant had shot at them. She became very excited aid. allowed me a bullet wound
in her left leg
POHCIS - mentions "About two or tiireo days before the English came to
Belsen I was working in the office....... when one of the soldiers cams to me and
said that there was seme shooting in No. 2 Gang)......... I went to No. 2 Gamp
to see what was happening and I saw there Lieut. Ujvazy of the Hungarian Aruy
shoot two women prisoners who were mar the wire that surrounds the camp..........
The two women fell to the ground and lay still."
PEE'DriDLICH -jr mentions "About noon on 14 April 1945, the day before the
English arrived, ny cousin Bella and I were among a party of prisoners going to
collect carrots for themselves....... Between Kitchen 1 and Kitchen 2 was a large
pile of carrots, mostly rotten, and we were taking these and hiding them in our
clothes for taking away. I v/as just bending down to pick seme up when I heard a
shot, and ry cousin, who was meet to m, collapsed. I looked tip and saw a Hungarian
officer with two stars........1 also ran away and hid behind the bread store
about 200 yards away."
HCEDGR - mentions "A day or so before the liberation I was on guard duty
in No. 1 Camp|and ry post was outside the wire surround. I was speaking to a
Hungarian woman who was inside the wire, when Lieut. Ujvary came up and ordered me
to aond the wosasn away......He then shot at Ihe woman and went away. The woman
fell down; she was covered with blood anasjpeared to be injured in the thigh."
KfiCIb was	by the Prosecuting Officer before the trial to see whether
■Sic incident he was referring to was the same as that mentioned by EHEUKDLIGII.
The irisoaecuting Officer states it was quite apparent that they were not 1iie same
incidents,, as the two women that POBDIS had seen shot wore at least 70 metres
from ary building and there were no piles of rottirg vegetables anywhere in the
vicinity. Therefore he quite rightly refrained from calling PGRCIB for the
prosecution/﻿—
prosecution. KEMMXJCH could not be found and tlssrefcre cmild not give
evidenoe in person. Her evidence, accordingly, bad to be given in the form of an
affidavit. A further difficulty too arose from the fact that the court had to be
asked to infer that Bella KISUKDiLItSf was a Rumanian by virtue of the fact that her
cousin was one. Further she could not, as a Rumanian, be considered' an Allied
national.
With regard to the remaining witnesses, in view of ihe fact that the
cook-house 'here HgEUTOTLICH states that her cousin was shot was nowhere near the
perimeter wire,easd(^terefore^thereT waS^little point in calling evidence as to orders
issued by the Hungarians regarding the shooting of persons approaching the wire,
If you will let me liave any further observations you have to make on this
I will put them before the Group Captain on his return from leave.

HMLHRUMN walked out of the hut in which we lived in order to go to the
toilet. Shortly afterwards a girl, whose name I do not know, ran into
the hut and told me that my sister had just been shot by a Hungarian soldier
and that an Hungarian officer was present. 1 ran out of the hut to get ny
sister but she was being carried back by some other girls who had already
picked her up. We brought her into the hut and laid her on the bed.
She was bleeding profusely and within the hour she died. The bullet had
pierced the lung and come out through her back.

li	I am 22 years of age and I joined the Hungarian Amy in September 1944*
I was first posted to the infantry and later to ny present regiment which was at
Belsen.
2,	About two or three days before the English came to ’Belsen, No.4 Compary
was ordered to jSarade for guard duty at lo.l Camp. This was due to the fact that
son© of the S.S. guards were leaving. On parade the Lieutenant of the Company,
Lieutenant UJVARY, ordered' us to shoot' any prisonei-s who attempted to escape or
who come within 10 metres of the ware. He further stated that any soldiers who
failed to carry out this order would be shot. Guards were then posted around the
wire, on the outside, about 100 metres apart.
3.	On the second day that we were on guard Lieutenant OTVAKY came about
nddr-day to inspect the guard. At this time there was a big crowd of prisoners
around the cook-house. When Lieutenant D3VARY saw this he took out his pistol
and fired into the crowd until his magazine, of seven bullets, was enpty.
I saw several people fall to the ground but was sent away by Lieutenant UJVAUI
into the kitchen before I could see whether ary had been killed or wounded.
About half an hour later I came out of the kitchen and I saw that a lot of
women prisoners were crying. I also saw that several of the men prisoners were
carrying bodies away to the huts. I do not know whether these people were
dead or just injured. A Hungarian woman prisoner asked me why the Lieutenant
had shot at them. She became very excited and showed me a bullet wound in her
left leg which she said she had received as a result of this shooting. I
do not know this women' a name. Lieutenant UJVASY is a very strict officer and in
view of this I did not hang about and ask questions as to whether any had been
killed or injured.

DEPOSITION OP Dezso BAGSIULAKI (male) late of Tokol, Hungary, sworn before me.
Captain Alexander Mackinloy Forbes, R.A., Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes
Investigation Team,
1.	I was been at Tokol in Hungary in 1926 and voluntarily entered the
Arny Cadet School in 1940. I am at present a Second Lieutenant serving in
No.4 Company, 1st. Battalion, 1st. Hungarian Tank Regiment, stationed at
*
Belsen Camp.
2.	No.4 Company, commanded by Lieutenant BJVAKX, took over guard duties
in No.l Gamp at Belsen from the SS on Friday, 13th. April 1945, two days
before the liberation of Belsen. I was second in command of the second
platoon. Lieutenant UJVAHT addressed the Counany on a parade that morning
and gave us the following orders:- (l) guards were to shoot any internees
coming nearer than 10 metres to the wire; (2) guards must take care not to
shoot into the crowds (3) Guards were not to speak to internees; (4) failure
to cany out these orders would involve punishment by the Germans.
3.	’ During that afternoon X heard guards shooting, but did not see ix ary one
was hurt. These shots were fired by the other half of the guard, not by
mine. I do not know if there were any shootings after the liberation.
4.	During that afternoon Captain VI2KIDEN3KI, who was Commandant of the
Hungarian Guard, gave us fresh orders - that the 3S orders no longer applied,
and guards were only to shoot internees if they were crossing the wire. This
{n-fis *-“■
was the last order given-until, the British took over: We were then told
to keep the internees inside the wire because of typhus, and not to shoot any
of them, but if there was no other means of keeping them in, to fire into the
air. The Hungarian officers then told the guards not to load their weapons.
5.	Lieutenant HJVAET was sever; in his treatment of the soldiers. J have
never seen or heard of him shooting/any internees; I have only seen him
striking Hungarian soldiers, and cannot say whether they deserved this or not,
6.	Second Lieutenant MOLNAR belonged to another Company. All I know about
him is that he is now absent. I have never heard of a Cadet HAMDHI

1#	I am 25 years old, a Snnoanian and uniaarried. I used to work as a clerk
in an Ironmonger^ shop. * I was arrested in Budapest in September 1944 by the
Hungarian Police as a Jewess. After 6 days at Dachau I was sent to Belsen where
X found nr/ cousin Bella Freundlich was also a prisoner *
2.	About noon on/the day before the English arrived,By cousin Bella and
I were among a part of prisoners who were going to collect carrots for themselves.
V,e had had no food for two days, and the Camp was quite in disorder. Between
Kitchen 1 and Kitchen 2 was a large pile of carrots, mostly rotten: we were
taking these and hiding them in our. clothes for taking away. I was just bending
down to pick some up when I heard a shot, and my cousin, who was next to me,
collapsed. I looked up and saw a Hungarian Officer with two stars on his
collar holding a smoking pistol, in his hand. The crowd imediately dispersed,
leaving ny cousin behind. I also ran away and laid behind the bread store,
about 200 yards away, waiting to see what happened. About an hour later
this officer and the soldiers who were supposed to be guarding the carrots ,
but had not done anything about it, all went away. I then went back to see
what had happened to *y cousin Bella. There were some men internees standing
around her body. Ha-head was ccered in blood and I could not beare to look for
the wound. The men helped ire to take her body to a pile of corpses several
hundred yards away.
2.	In ooujaw S/76690SO Serjeant Stanley Soodooek, a.A.S.0., Juice

DEPOSITION OF FERENC HOLZHAUSER (Male) sworn before Captain ALEXANDER
MACKENLAI FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War Crimes Investigation
4	i
Team.
I am a Hungarian and 1? years old. I was compelled by the
1
Germans to join the Levente, a youth organization, and as a member of that
came to Braunschweig. On 25th February 1945 I was called up for the S.S. but
escaped to Belsen where I reported to the Hungarian unit and became a soldier
in the Hungarian Army. I had ordinary duties at first and later was put on
on guard on one corner of the place in front of the cook-house for men
internees. Another soldier named SOKVARI was on guard on another comer.
As the first British car came into Belsen Camp I saw 20 or 25 Polish internees
come out of their block and go into the cellar of the kitchen. A Hungarian
officer named PAID saw this and told two of the guards named SIPOS and _
BRAUNITZER, to go down into the cellar and shoot the Poles. They refused
to do so. PATO thereupon took a guard’s rifle and himself went down into the
cellar. I next heard three or four shots inside the cellar.	PATO then came
up out of the cellar and said * I have shot two of the Poles’.	He went' away
then and inspected other guards.
About 7 o’clock that evening I saw other internees carrying
two dead Poles out of that cellar. I saw for myself that they were dead: they
had bullet wounds near the heart,
BRAUNITZER and SIPOS were later punished for disobeying
this order. They have escaped now arid I think are back in Hungary.
5,	On 10th July 1945, accompanied by No. S/259166? Staff-
serjeant ERNEST STANLEY COMING, Royal Anty Service Corps, Judge Advocate
General’s Branch, attached to No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Team, I saw a
Hungarian officer whom I immediately identified as PATO. I saw him when
he was walking along the road from Bergen to Belsen in the company of another
Hungarian officer named TJJTAHf and two British soldiers.﻿A. >

THE DEFENCE OF LIEUTENANT UJ7ASY
i
D E P 0 S I T I 0 N of CAPTAIN CEORC WISKIPMSKY, Hungarian, at
present serving as Adjutant of the Central School, Hungarian Tank Regimait,
stationed at BELSHN Camp, sworn before Captain Alexander Macldnlay FORBES,
Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, Ho 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I first met LIEUTSfAHT Ujmi on the 13th April 1945,
wiien I was sent up to Ho 1 Camp at BELSi© to replace Captain HBALY, who
was in charge of the Hungarian Guard there, and who had. gone sick. I
arrived there about four o'clock in the afternoon and found LIEUTiiKAHT
UJVARY on duty. He told me that his orders from the Germans were
that the guards were to shoot any of the internees who came too close
to the wire, as they were criminals and sick with Typhus. I was sur-
prised at this, because it is not like & Hungarian to use his arms in
such a case, and issued fresh orders that the Htfigarian guards were
not to shoot the internees.	I sent these orders round the Hungarian
guards by messenger on a bicycle. UJVARY and, I alien went round
»
inspecting all the Hungarian guards, and the conditions I saw behind the
wire 'confirmed, my opinion that my order not to shoot the internees was
the correct order; there was no one trying to escape. As we went round
TJJVARY in my presence told each Hungarian guard that he was not to
shoot the internees. I then held an Officers' Conference at which I
ordered that no guards were to shoot the internees, but also that they
were not to talk to them or have dealings with them.
2.	'	I know that UJVARY carried out my orders. It is
possible, however, that he acted contrary to them without my' knowledge;
in that event I should expect to see him punished for disobedience. I
have not seen him shoot or ill treat any of the internees. A few days
after the 13tb April 1945 I heard soldiers and internees saying that
UJYMY had given orders for internees to be shot. I thereupon ordered
a parade of my troops and called on any men to come for war a who had shot
internees in consequence of this order. No one came forward. I mentioned﻿1
this to iJJ’/ARY, who said that possibly some soldier or some internee
from his home was trying to make trouble for him.
3*	I remained in charge of the guard for about three
t
weeks. In that time UJVARY and I became good friends. He was a good
soldier and a gentleman but his men did not like him because he was severe.

Yes.
Have you a Cadet Hamory in this Camp?
Wo, but there is an officer cadet, ZAMOEY.
Is he in the Camp?
He is still in the Camp. Officer Cadet Zamoiy, with two other
Cadets, was taken on my orders to Headquarters, Belsen, to
be sent to a German Prisoners' Camp.
Why?
They sold their pistols for money.
When were they put under arrest?
I do not know exactly: yesterday or to-day.

The British Military Police reported it to me.
How many of your officers are absent frora the Regiment?
Six.
Do you mean six, including Lieutenant Molnar?
Yes, including him.
Why are the other five absent?
I do not know exactly why. They simply went. Two hundred
of the men have also deserted.
mien did the five officers desert?
At the beginning of May.
Did yoU take any steps to have thou arrested?
I could take no steps.
Could you not have re orted it to the English Commander who
could have given the neeessaxy orders to the British troops
The five officers who went were reported to the British
authorities.
What is the total strength of the Regiment?
I do not know exactly - about 2,200 all ranks, which includes
160 officers.
Did any Company do duty at Ho. 1 Concentration Camp, except
Ho. 4 Company?
1 do not know.
Do you appreciate that as the officer cotsaanding 1^®
Hungarian troops it would seem that you are responsible
for what those troops did?

If you are not responsible, who is responsible?
The German Camaander of the Concentration Camp.
But they were your troops being used, not his troops?
I had nothing to do with my troops as they were under Geratan
command.
Frankly, Colonel, I do not understand your answers. As a
British officer, I cannot see how you can avoid the
responsibility for your own troops. Do you wish to make any
further explanation about this? x
The Hungarian troops who were on duly received orders from the
German Commanding Officer and not from me.
But you have told me that you received orders to supply the
troops.
Yes.
Did you not knew/ on the 12th April that the Geimns had been
responsible for atrocities at the Concentration Camp."5
Yes.
In the circumstances, did you not. consider that it was necessary
to stop your troops being used for the same purposes?
I have no idea what happened in Ho. 1 Camp.
But you have just told me that you knew on-the 12th April that
the Germans had been committing atrocities xn Ho. 1 amp.
I have never been in the Concentration Camp and did not know
what had happened.
But surely you could not have lived for three months within a
mile of the Camp without having some idea of what ms going
on and what the Germans were doing?
I had no idea.
Did you not know the general reputation of the Germans in their
Concentration Camps?
No.
Were you a member of the Hungarian Nasi Party?
1 have never been anything except a soldier.
Did you know that your troops were going to be used for
guarding women and children among other people?
Yes. I knew there must have been some women and children
in the camp.
Did you not think it necessary for you to give orders to
your troops where women and(children were concerned?
I could not imagine what could happen in such a Concentration
Camp; therefore, I gave no orders.
, You now know that 26,000 people - the majority of them women
and including many children - have been murdered?
No.
/ Q. 70.﻿Q. 70. Are you telling me that you do not knew that the British
found 13,000 dead corpses in the Cariip?
A* *70# Xcs#
Q. 71, Are you telling me that you do not know that 13,000 other
people have died despite all the aid we could give since
we came?
A, 71. Yes, I was told a lot of people died from typhus.
Q, 72. Are you now happy that your troops were used for three days
before the British came to guard these people in the
Concentration Gamp?
A. 72. No. Now I am not happy about it.

What do you now ca-tand?
The Tank School fieeinmt.
ifegiment
Is that a differed from that conBaanded by Colonel BALO?
I a® in cora'aand of the Begiment and Colonel BALO is in
oaMaand of the School. Colonel Balo is ray superior officer.
I am not clear. Are there here a Hungarian Tank Begimeat,
and also a Hungarian Tank School?
Yes, To the Tank School belonged a Tank Eegkaent and an
Infantry Begimmt, wliich is no laager here.
When did the Infantry Regiment leave?
The Infantry Reglownt was in part carried off by the Germans
in batches because the soldiers were given work digging
ditches, and so on.
Were there ary of the Infantry Regiment still here on the
12th April?
The Infantry Regiment was never here at Bergen but at a Camp
at Muaster, only it ms under the cewraand of that School*
What was the number and name of the Infantry Regiment?
No number. The name in Hungarian was; loversa Kik&pso
Eared (An Infantry Musketry Training School).
11mt was the number and name of the Tank Regiment here.
Tank School Regiment: it bad no number.
When did you arrive at iselsen?
On the 5th December, 1944.
Colonel Bale 1ms told me that he arrived on the 11th or 12th
December, 1944, and tint on his arrival lie (Colonel Bale)
oommanded the Panser shooting School.
Colonel Balo arrived about the middle of December. Before

ALTOBJAX ■was not here then. He only oarae In Fehruary,
and then Colonel ALTORJAX oonr^nded both me and Colonel Bale,
being siiperior to both of us*
Colonel Balo told me that he was in coniaand^cf the Hungarian
liegiment and was responsible for its discipline and the
carrying out of any orders received.
yes. He ms responsible for the discipline and the carrying
out of orders in both of the Regiments.
But as 1 understand it, you were the Colonel who was immediately
asramnding the Tank Regiment?
Tea.
Were you in that position on the 12th April, 1945?
I was in command of the Regiment only until the end of 'March,
1945. Then the Germans created an authority for maintaining
order; and then Colonel Balo took over the cossand of the
Regiment. I was only charged with the administration of the
Regiment.
Were orders received ty your Regiment to supply a Guard for the
Concentration Qmsg on the 12 th April?
Authority for keeping order, which I mentioned before, was
ordered on the 10th April to provide the Concentration Cau?p
her© with Guards. The only men taken out of ay Regiment
were those who were provided with rifles, but about 500 men
without rifles remained under tay eosaaand. Colonel Bale,
who was charged with keeping order, was in charge of providing
the Concentration Camp with Guards, which he did.
Shis is the order I received then (letter produced by
Colonel Bercsdnyi).
fh&t were the orders mentioned therein which you had not been
able to carry out?
I could not carry out any orders because 1 had not the men
necessary for it. and I did not receive ary orders. It was
not ny fault and only by mistake that I received the order.
What were the orders dated the 10th April to which this letter
refers?
M$r Companies and smaller units were taken away in batches from
‘®e so I remained only with one officer and his adjutant and
all the orders were Issued directly to those units taken away.
That is the reason I applied to say superior to let me know
'the orders because I could not carry out any orders if I did
not know ■them.
Hav© you now received a copy of the orders of the 10th April?
I never received any copy of the orders.
Have you any other documents which you wish me to see?
In connection with this question, only this document which
I have already produced. If possible I sh°^ to k
the document returned to me as I may be in need of it.
We need this original document, but we will simply y°u wi'fcl:L

and will need it*

Tli® original will be jsertdreS" in the hands of the British
authorities but it will be available to you if you require
it for your mm purposes. Fhat is tl® other doottnent
you liav® in your hand?
It ia a copy of the original document, but I ahouM like to
have a co y confined by the British authorities.
I will let you have it. What responsibility did you have
in respect of supplying the Guard Company for the
Ccnoeri* ration Capp?
1 had no resr.cnsibility.
Were ou responsible for issuing aisnunition?
Ho. It was not rry duty and I was not responsible. 1
submitted the letter- to prove that I Imd no Icnowledge of
tlie issue of the orders. I was ordered to visit the Allied
lines and to agree upon surrender on the 11th April. It
was on the 11th and 12th April •» then I was with tiie
English. There were sane English and Canadian pilots
who wore shot down and 1 guarded them and took them with me
when I went to the British lines as an emissary. Afterwards
the Hungarian CcesaaM knew of it and they approved of it
fifterworda because' I had succeeded in ty mission* .
When did you return to Belsen?
About 6 or 7.30 p.s. m Hie 12th April, together with a
British General who proceeded back to his troops. I
remained here.
As the officer in charge of administration, are you in charge
of the Regimental dociaxr.ts?
Yes. I was responsible for the administration and for
keeping Hi® orders and documents, but before the arrival
of Hie Allied troops all records were destroyed.
Ifow were they destroyed?
All Hie pap ers and records were burned.
Ga whose orders was this done?
to German orders which 1 received'Httou# Colonel Halo.,
jtive you still got th» written order which Colonel Altor^qy
give to Colonel lialo on Hi© 12th Apri?. In regird to Hi®
guards at th® Conoentraticm Carp?
Of this order 1 had no knowledge, because,it was issued
directly, and I knew noHiing of it. T. erefore 1 made
the report when 1 heard of it afterwards* Tte soldiers
of rey Hegiiaent were dispersed in vori,ous spots, and so,
being detached fer vorious duties, some of the soldiers
fomed the Guard, and those units received the orders
directly and I had no toowledge of the order, and only
afterwards did 1 know of it. Here is the co y of another
report which I submitted m the 24th April to Hie Hungarian
Garrison Coranander at Bergen on th© 24Hi A ril. I have
no knowledge of the order issued an the 10th April, and
therefore I could not. carry it out. I asked to be told
of the order.

I learned it affterrawLs about the 17th April when I went
around to control units. Then I. spoke with two officers,
one named VISKIBINSKI and UJVARI: Ujvari was in ccwnand
of Ifo. 4 q^Qssgoany* ’?hei1 1 asked what they were doing there,
and they said they were in charge of the Guard. I asked
whether they were well fed. The British Guards were there
' and 1 was not permitted to enter the Camp at all.
As I understand it, you say that you were responsible only for
administration and not for any action taken by any of the
Companies.
Yes, I was responsible for administration only end for no
actions. i supplied the units with food and medical
supplies, and was in charge of the sick.
fas Ujvari a Captain or a Lieutenant?
First Lieutenant.
What did Captain KIRALY caraaend?
Captain Kiraly, being a sick man, was in omaand of the unit
for only four or five tours. He was then replaced by
Captain VlSKIMfSKl,
Before the 12th April tod you been in the Concentration Camp?
I did not know of -Site existence of the Concentratlor^amp before.
Is it not very strange that .you were here for over three months
within a mile of the Camp and did not too?/ it existed?
It is strange, but I was not allowed to pass 0. certain point.
Sometimes I saw bread transported from the Bakery to somewhere
where it was said there was a Camp. I saw Russian
prisoners in green suits and I tow/ that there was a Camp
tore, but I did not too// what kind of Camp, Imaedistely
before I started to go to the British Troops, then I was
informed by the Geimaa Commander HAJtSUE of the existence
of the Concentration Gamp, because I was told that in
addition to the Russian prisoners there were approximately
65,000 people who have fallen ill with typhus.
When you found you were not permitted beyond a certain point
were you not suspicious as to what was happening?
I was told that there was a Caisp with sick people, but I afedi
1 was not such interested in what was there.
Bid vou guess that the sick people were in fact civilian
prisoners?
I had no knowledge of it and I did not ask, but once in
conversation it transpired that I was told that there was a
Oaiap for convicted German soldiers there.
Mm I right in saying that it ms general toowiedge that the
Gersnns had for many years been committing atroc-ties in
their Concentration Canips?
I do not know whether it was a general opinion, but I tod no
knowledge of it. I tom that there .were Concentration
Camps to Hungary, too, but I believed they existed onDy
for guarding those people but without any atrocities.
Bo you seriously wish me to believe that you tod no knowledge
end tod heard no information that the Germans had for years
been comitting atrocities in their Concentration Camps?
/Q. 40.
Q* 40.﻿- 5 -
A» 40. I heard about the existence of Concentration Coops in general,
but X did not know what it aeant and the life in then.
Q. 41. Are you aware that the whole world knew except yourself?
A. 41. caly cm 17th April when I afterwards had a look at the
liberated Concentration Cf-ffitp was it that I became aware of
tiic jaeaning of it. before, 1 suppoeedthat Concentration
Csusps were only for guarding those people whom the authorities
wanted to detain. In Hungary the pr®3® was under control
and the preor. could never write about such matters as
Concentration Ossips.
t. 42. What was your opinion when .you went into the Concentration Camp
on tiie l?th April?
A. 42 It was horrible. I cent potatoes while the Oerraana tier© here*
on every vehicle available, to the Concentration Can®),

It is his duty.
I am putting these questions to you as if you were a CcJLonel
^o^nSng a Regiment and Imd sent a Company to the Camp.
The first duty of the Com under of a Rftgi^it ftftudB a Company
to a Concmtrrttion Caap is to cxitrol the Ca.-Eany.
ould you oensider that an order to shoot prisoners vliilst still
within the Camp ms a proper order to give?
1 was' not aware of th© dromstances in the Omcsntn^tion Camp*
and therefor© I cannot give a direct answer
B’or instance, if t!ic guard ^ ci-e attacked by til© jjrijan-ers I
would Issue an older to shoot, but not without necessity*
Would you consider it neeessasy for guards to
outside the wire at prisoners who approached within ten
metres of the, inside of. the wire?
1 would not regard it as being neoesswy. As a soldier I
oarnot undeSmd wly a guard should shoot at a dist^ioe
of ten metres wlien barbed wire is bcte,-ecn. I cannot under-
stand it.
fiould you be surprised to hear that those v/ere tlie orders
revived md car ded out by Htoenrion troops7.
Pram whesa did th© Hungarian soldiers receive such an order?
/ y. ..........﻿Q. 50
The order was issued hy the German Commander and passed on
by Hungarian officers.
A. 50. If such an order were received from the Germans then the
German commander is responsible for issuing the order,
as the Hungarian troops were under German command.
Q. 51. Do you consider that there is no responsibility attaching
to the Hungarians for obeying such orders?
A. 51. No, because they are soldiers .
Q. 52. Is it your opinion that if a soldier receives an order to do
an illegal act he should obey the order?
A. 52. According to the Hungarian Regulations, a soldier must carry
out ary order received from his superiors apart from the
question of whether they were legal or not, and the superior
only is responsible for the carrying out^this order.
Q. 55. fculd the answer apply if the order were to murder somebody?
A. 53.	If I were ordered to comniit murder I would not carry it out.
Q. 54,	Supposing Hungarian troops were ordered to ecsnmit murders,
according to your previous answers that would be doing
their duty in carrying out those orders.
A. 54. There is a difference between murdering and carrying out the
duties of a guard.
Q. 55. Would you please answer the question?
A. 55. I do not know that it is explicitly stated in Hungarian
Military Regulations, but it is my opinion that if somebody
gets an order to commit murder he has to reports it to his
•	superiors before carrying it out. But it is quite another
thing if I have to kill somebody whilst carrying out my
duties as a guard. E’er instance; if a prisoner tries
to escape.
Q. 56.	Would that also apply to a woman prisoner?
A. 56.	A woman or man! it is all the same. The Guard has to shoot
if somebody is trying to escape.
Q. 57. Does that apply to a child prisoner?
A. 57. In my opinion, if a child tried to escape there would be no
necessity to shoot him because a. child could be prevented
from escaping in Other ways. One has to act according to
common sense.
Q. 58.	Is it the usual conduct of the Hungarian Army to shoot women?
A. 58.	No. Such events in the Hungarian Army have not been known.
Q. 59.	When did you first know that Hungarian troops had ccsnmitted
murders in the Concentration Camp?
A. 59.
Q. 60.
A. 60,
I never heard of it until now.
DC you not know that two of your officers are under arrest
for murder?
Yes. I know that two Hungarian officers are under arrest
because one allegedly‘shot thirty and the other four
prisoners, but I was never before told of it.

no more shameful duty could be given to the Hungarian
troops.
Q. 84. Have you any explanation vijy Hungarian troops carried out
ouch a shameful duty?
A. 84. I regarded it as shameful only when I saw afterwards, on
the 17th April, tut when the duty fltwi to fee
liHigardan troops they did not ham what duly it was.
They knar/ only that it was to guard the Concentration Camp.
q. 85. Was it not obvious upon the arrival of the Hungarian guards
feat the duty assi£fied to then was shameful?
A. 83. On fee l/fe April, when I learned in what way the Hiaagarim
troops hud been used I regarded it as though the Gexraans
bad wanted to make them ashamed. That was uy opinion
afterwards.

IN THE MATTER OP WAR CRIMES
AND
ATROCITIES AT DELS®.
DEPOSITION OP ALEXANDER ENGEL (Male) late of Marasiaros sziget, Rumania, sworn
<6
before Captain ALEXANDER ^lACKCNLAY FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
1,	I am a Rumanian and 21 years of age.	civilian occupation was
carpenter. I was arrested as a Jew on 11th April 1944.	1 1i7as Auschwitz,
and then another camp in Silesia, and arrived at No. 1 Camp in Belsen on 8th
April 194-5 where I lived in Block 12.
2.	I remember the morning of 15th April 194-5, the day of our
liberation.	We had had no food for two days, and found our task of burying
the corpses very hard. Capos were pressing us on, While we were employed in
•t-.h-s r task we passed a pile of turnip peelings. Some of us went to take peelings
off the pile. There was a Hungarian soldier posted about 20 metres away:
without any warning he fired at ny friend Doctor SCHGNSTEIN, who fell down
thereupon. The Hungarian soldier then approached, and when he saw that
SCHQNSTEEN was still alive, fired two more shots into his body. I tried to
run away with the others, but an S.S. man and a Capo called me back vdth a man
MOSES and another man, and ordered us to carry 3CH0^'^3TEIN, s body away
and place it on a pile of corpses.
X saw the Hungarian soldier fire at SCHQNSTEXN and I saw three
bullet wounds in SCHOIiSTEIN‘ s tody - one in the head, one in the stomach and
kx&A?t,
the third in the-gp©#®*
i do not know the names of the Hungarian soldier, the S.S. man or
the Capo, and cannot now remember what they looked like. I believe uhat MDSES
went to Sweden about 9th or 10th fcjSk 1945. He was aged about 32 - 35 years,
a very tall, thin man with brown hair brushed back, two teeth missing in front,
and blue eyes: he came from Kolozsvar and was recently living in Block W. 6.
The other man who helped us to carry SCHONSTEIN’s body went to Gzechoslovakia
on 8th July 194-5. He was a small man with short brown hair, blue eyes and a
short, small moustache. He was a cobbler by trade and wanted to go back to
Ruthenla (P.K.R.) He used to live in Block 17.

V ith roferenco to the ceoential imrt of your report,
aooortMng to the insts^stioEa in force (para* 11, tossy egulations)
1 asto the following r«mrks:*
Aocarding to toe inatraotletis dated 10 April, 1945, the
of the Shooting rohool is by this ostler in charge of a special
unit responsible for maintaining order, s© that since that tine all
&ttaoied units are direotly 'imder his oatamand.
It follow;’ t!-at the Tmdc ?x>.&amt GcmmxAer was not
responsible for any natters rel&tiag to tlie raiatmanoe of order.
This sawas that toe Tank ll&gimnt feoeived ordars of which it had no
knowledge.
/% s^alu ******﻿fco tills irreg-alari^, anti 1 objected to It one® before.
The Aregr Beguiatieas, 1‘dxt I g 71/4 ostlers that If a
I again c®31 the attention of the Itegkaont&l 0
subordinate CosmsMer receivoa any order <llreot fra.i sammam who is not
his iame&Ute inferior he oust report it to his imedkite surierior.
I find til:it according to your report m thin subject the above umtionM
instruction lias not yet b©m put Into effect in the Begiasnfc, aithou^i
I haw alresudtor ancse before oaliod your attenti<a to it. It is -the duty
of th Eegteimtai Ganiasaler t© put an end to &acfo irregularities. I do
nc-fc saoerpt your statement iBiat an order was given direct to subordinate
units because of urgency or because no one oould be foiasd at ttie
.hegiiaeatal Coanand, and tlius it w&b not possible to oontrol the order*
The Scgtaatal Cixxmx&er should have considered it .Important
in' vieii--' of say fesnaar rmasfe, and if lie ted directed his aiuberdlmtes to
abide by the regulation there would haw been no heed to refer to
irregularities eaused. by ttie Eegiiaental OOHEaaMer'e &vm. osissians as he
did in his report.
Yota? attention is salted to the necessity for being ..ore
objective for the sate of the Servio®,
I therefore order you in tlis fbti're to rut m end to these
irregularities. Should a O^Ksmander's superior issue oidere tonediately
to his subordinates-ty reason of urgency these orders should, be carried
out luBediutely but n report should be r.ade to intessediate superiars.
X;ur attention is also called to the necessity of adhering
to tli© chain of conaand( and if this is not done in the future you sill
b© answerable to ess.

senior Lieutenant in ay canpanyo
£o in the morning of the 13th April 1945 No?4 Company took up guar-i duties
at gOo1 Camp at Belsen. I was ITjvary* s first officer in that company*
Captain KiraXy was in charge of the whol.e guard, but was succeeded that
afternoon by captain Wlsk&denaky, we took our first orders from the German
G-uarcl ccmmander, captain Baiaagarten* .3: acted as interpreter between him and
njvary and remember that we were told1 the guards were to shoot any internees
who came nearer than ten metres to the wire, that they were not to let the
internees form s. crowd or gather .round the kitchens* These orders were
giv&n tc the whole. company on parade by uivary I do not remember if I was
present at this parade. The guard towers ware manned by German troops*
Between the towers there were two Hungarian guards outside the wire, and inside
the Gamp there were two Hungarian guards by each of the three kitchens and
two more by the food store*'
5* That afternoon captain Wiskidensky gave, ua fresh orders* Guards were
only to shoot intJKpes if they, had got over the wire and there was no.-ether
.means of preventing their escape, Those were the last orders we received
before the liberation,
4« I did not myself see any guards shoot the internees*' sometimes at night
3 heard shots? but I never found anyone who had been hurt* On changing guard
I several times found the ammunition was deficient? on my making enquiries
the Hungarian soldiers said that they had shot into the air* X never saw
anyone with bullet wounds*
5*	1 have never seen or heard of Ujvary shooting an internee, on duty he
was always with somebody, usually myself, and so we must have known if he hade
further, the guards wars only 50 metres .apart and if he had shot anyone they
must have seen it*
Olivary and 1 worked closely together but off duty we each had our own
friends and did not sae a great deal of. each other* in matters of discipline
he was severe, but in private life he is a gentleman? well educated, kind,
pleasant manners* I wopld certainly, believe bis word,

DEPOSITION OP MIHALY SOLI (Male) late of Szeged, Hungary, sworn before
Captain ALEXANDER MACKINLAY FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1
War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am a Hungarian and 22 years old. My civilian occupation
Tjfas a travelling merchant in flour, salt, etc. On 29th August 1944 I
was conscripted into the Hungarian Army and on 11th December 1944
arrived at Belsen Camp where I joined 4th Company, 1st Hungarian Tank
Regiment.	I have been a clerk in the office for the last 2g- weeks.
2.	I first saw Exhibit "A" now produced and shown torame on 11th
July 1945. At 0700 hours on that date 2/Lieut. BIBO handed it to me
in the office and told me to enter it in the register as having been
received on 15th April 1945. He said that this was necessary because
Lieut. UJVARY was being accused of giving orders to shoot internees.
There was no one else present at that time. I did not want to do this,
and put it aside after I had shown it to another clerk, TOMDSANYI, who
came in a little later. It was later registered in ny presence by
Serjeany PORGACS, who was in charge of the office. I recognise Exhibit
"B" now produced and shown to me as the register of confidential orders.
It was in this book that I saw him make the entry which appears at the
top of the third page. I recognise Exhibit "C" now produced and shown
to me as a note which I read in the office on the morning of 15th July
1945. His servant HAISX told us that 2/Lt BIBO read it and tore it up
because he was so excited. HAISZ gave the pieces to TOMCSANYI in my
presence.

Dear Group Captain,
I ain, to put it mildly, Goraavrhat dioturhed, with regard to the
Hungarian oases which appear to be coming up for trial. This week two of them,
Lieuts. PATO & tJJVMY were tried by a Military Court at Celle on oharges
of murder and both acquitted.
With regard to PATO, we only had two witnesses who were Hungarian
soldiers and these ware called in parson by the prosecution but apparently
were tied in knots by the defending officer, with the result as mentioned
above that PATO was acquitted. This was a possibility in this case
which we had foreseen.
With regard to IKNJMSL, however, the oase is most alarming
with regard to the other cases earring on in the future. I want to emphasise
that the information I am giving you about this case is not entirely first haul;
it was gathered by Staff Serjeant Woodcock of this Team who was called as a
witness in this case and who, therefore, was not in the court throughout
the proceedings, but he was able to gather quite a lot of information from
the court orderly. From our records the following witnesses seemed to be
essential for the prosecution to call;-
J. NAGY
G. BOH22S
V. FBMELSGH
A. SGLYOK
L.	HSTHNYI
A.-HGDOE
In fact according to the copy of instructions for 'die bringing
to the court of the witnesses, the following list shows the witnesses for
the prosecution who were asked fors-
G. P0B1IS
Capt. raOTMOr
J. TCXSCANYI
M.	SULI
L. HSWU
j. mmm.
The following e aments are made with regard to this: -
Staff-Serjeant Woodcock assures me that, to the best of his knowledge,
the only evidence offered by the prosecution was:	(1) an Affidavit which
was read of Vilma FTOTDMGH, (2) Evidence by Woodcok himself, apparently
with regard to identification, and, (3) Captain Georg Wiskidensky.
Captain WiJkiGensJsy appears in our records as a witness for the defence
of UJYiffil, and it is, therefore, not understood why he should be called for ilia
nysifpcution. With regard to the rest of the witnesses that the prosecution
asked for, P05SBX8 was in court but never called, ICM3ANYI and SHLI were,
in sy opinion, completely imnecessary and in fact were also not called.
KSTahYI was also in cota^t but not called; FQ3&JCR against wiiom evidence
exists as to War Crimes was also in court but not called.
I have ascertained that NAGY, 3GLYCH and HODOE are at this
K.<*aeat available in Belsen and could quite easily have been called by the
prosecution.
Apparently the case was dismissed for insufficient evidence,
co not know who was responsible for deciding on how Hie prosecution was
We presented and I hesitate, with only scrappy information at ny disposal,
ssy the case was presented wrongly. However, the fact remains that from
t af-fcwrs? it is obvious that, unless some unknown explanation exists as to
j reason for the prosecution adducing such meagre evidence then plentiful
icieace exists, the affair has been mismanaged at some 1 vel, I am only﻿i
-2
sending you this information beoausa if this is a sarrrole of what may happen
ivthe future I think that serious oonsideration ought to be given as to
«khsr "liiQ resaainder of the Hungarians should be tried.
The local effect here has been enorjnous. My contacts with the
Hungarian soldier® state that their attitude xasy be susaaed up in the
words "This is too easy, the English obviously can't do anything; about
us at all." Although I have no proof I fear that this will have the most
serious effect on the procuring of evidence with regard to Concentration
Camp Guards. The unwillingness of witnesses to come forward for various
reasons had at last been partially overcome but X anticipate that this
may result in a ccerplete drying up of all further evidence frcsa witnesses
here.
A further alarraing side to the matter is that PATO at least is known to
have been allowed to return to this Camp. X have arranged that he shall be
imprisoned here for his own rjrotection as X understand he was looking
last night for the two witnesses who gave evidence against him, Xa it possible
in the future, if a Hungarian is acquitted, for him to be removed as far as possible
from tMo Camp and not permitted to return? I suggest most strongly that,
if it is possible, the ideal would be for ary such persons to be repatriated
to Hungary at once.
Incidentally, 22 witnesses were called for the defence including the
Hungarian Padre, who is believed to have said in court that this Team had
imprisoned these Hungarians, had refused to allow anyone to see them, and had
prevented them from finding out what the charge® were against them. This
in substance is true as the Hungarians have been considered by tlds Team
as being on ’all fours* with the SS guards at BELSSI, none of whom, of course
were formally charged, but only interrogated if it was thought that ary riseful
purpose could be served by so doing.
Another aspect of the case, of course, is the possibility that at future
Hungarian trials, no Hungarian soldier witnesses will come forward, to give evidence
for two reasons; firstly, the idea that it will be useless to da so because
every Hungarian will be acquitted, and, secondly, the understandable fear that
the acquitted person will be enabled to return here and avenge himself if he so
wishes.
I do not know on what charges IJJVAHX and PATO stood trial. It right be
that UJVAHX was only charged with one cose of murder. If this be so, I do not
know whether it is worth sending him for trial on the other incidents which are
alleged in the depositions against him.
For your information the Nurhers of t lie depositions which we considered
were useful, against OTVAHX are;-
227	Janos MASSt
228	Gyula P023CXS
230 Vilma EHiiUmLIGE

283 was sent to you on 13 Aug 45 under ref v'G/b/8.

whole matter in order to know what is the best line to take in the .future.

DEPOSITION OF KAROLY MONEK (male) late of Szentgotihard, Hungary, sworn before
Captain Alexander Mackinlay Forbes, R.A., Legal Staff, No.l War Crimes
Investigation Team,
1,	I was bom at Zsida, Hungary in 1919 and was conscripted into the Hungarian
Army on 2nd, December 1940. I am at present a serjeant in No.4 Company, 1st,
Battalion, 1st. Hungarian Tank Regiment, stationed '^at Belsen Camp.
2,	ly Cojnpany took over guard duties at No.l Camp, Belsen, on Friday, 13th.
> Vi *s 3,,
Apiil 1945. ’When the .whole. Company wad bn parade that morning Lieutenant TJJVAHY
gave the Oder that guards were to shoot any internee who came nearer than ten
metres to the wire. Two or three days later Captain VTSKIDENSKI said that
guards were only to shoot at internees if they were outside the wire or climbing
over it, and they were to aim so.as to hit the escaping internee and no one else.
I passed this order on to the guards who were on duty.
3,	Several times I was N.C.O. of the guard on duty. Once I heard firing and
on ™Vi rig inquiries was told by one guard that he had fired at someone trying
to escape. I did not see that anyone was hurt or apycne hear the wire. I
heard quite a lot of firing that Friday evening, but did not see that anyone was
hurt and the guards said they had been firing into the air.
4,	When the British came we received orders not to shoot or hit the internees
but if they were trying to get throu# the wire we were only to explain why
they were not allowed outside.
5,	Lieutenant UJVARY was disliked by the whole Company because he treated the
soldiers badly. I do not know of him ill-treating any of the prisoners: He
u.
was afraid ‘because his men also disliked him5 and always went about with sanebody
else, Sxkx
6. I know that MCSLNAR was a Second Lieutenant, but do not know anything about
him. I have never heard of a Cadet HAMOHI.

DEPOSITION of 2/Lleutenant Dezso BIBO, sworn befor# Captain
ALEXANDIR MACKINLAI FORBES, Royal Artillery, Legal Staff, No. 1 War '
Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am Hungarian and at present commanding No. 4 Company of the
1st Hungarian TarJj Regiment stationed at Belsen Camp. I went to the
Soldiers’ School at the age of 10 and was commissioned in November, 1944*
I arrived at Belsen Gamp on the 5th December, 1944, when I was a Platoon
Commander in No* 5 Compary. Ujvary arrived at about the end of December
and became the senior Lieutenant in my Company.
2.
In the raoming of the 13th April,'1945, Ho, % Company took
I was Ujvaxy’s first officer^'
up guard duties at No. 1 Camp at Belsen.
feaJ' C0w>|9ak*j -
Captain Kiraly was in charge of the whole guard, but was succeeded that
afternoon by Captain Wiskidensly. We took our first orders from the
German Guard Commander, Captain Baumgarten. I acted as interpreter
between him and Ujvary and remember that we were told the guards were to
shoot any internees who came nearer than ten metres to the wire, that
they were not to let the internees form a crowd or gather round the kitchens.
These orders were given to the whole Company on parade by Ujvaryj I do hot
remember if I was present at this parade. The guard towers were manned
by German troops. Between the towers there were Wo Hungarian guards
<*) *
outside the wire, and inside the Camp there were two Hungarian guards by
each of the three kitchens and two more by the food store.
3.	That afternoon Captain -Wiskidensly gave us fresh orders.
Guards were only to shoot internees if they had got over the wire and
there was no other means of preventing their escape. ''Those were*, the last .
orders we received before the liberation.
4,	I did not myself see ary guards shoot the internees.
Sometimes at night I heard shots; but I never found anyone who had been
hurt. On changing guard I several times found the ammunition was
deficient; on ny making enquiries the Hungarian soldiers said that they
/bad.......﻿had shot into the air. I never saw anyone with bullet wounds.
i have never seen or heard of Ujvaxy shooting an internee.
On duly he was always with somebody, usually myself, and so we must have
known if he had. Further, the guards were only 50 metros apart and if
he had shot anyone they must have seen it.
Ujvary and I worked closely together but off duty we eaoh had
6.
our own friends and did not see a great deal of each other. In matters
of discipline he was severe, but in private life he is a gentleman: well
educated, kind, pleasant manners. I would certainly believe his word.

1.	Information has been received in this office that the
SS-manWIIMSCHEN, who is one of the 47 accused, was recently taken
to hospital from CELLE Jail and died two days later. The
information appears reliable but is being confirmed and you will
be informed definitely one way or the other as soon as possible.
2.	It is understood from Lt-Col. Genn that at his recent
conversation with Major Murton-Neale in London on the question of
the Belsen trials, it was decided that the Hungarian guards
against whom allegations of War Crimes were made, should be tried
. jointly with the German accusedj On the other hand, when
Ubl. Halse spoke to me on the telephone the other day he stated
that the trials would probably be separate. Would you please
let us know the final decision upon this point.

Reference your 21 A Gp/15228/11/9/JAG dated 23 July 1945.
1	It is noted that SS-man WILMSCHEN has, according to information
which you have received, died.
2	With regard to para 2 of your minute it has been decided in
this office that the"trial of any Hungarian against whom there may
be a prima faoie case of ill-treatment should be separate and apart
from the members of the SS guard and KAPOS at Belsen.
3	It is felt that this course should be adopted since the majority
of the concentration camp guards were members of the 33 and further
it was only at a later stage, some witnesses say only a day or two
before the camp was overrun, that the Hungarian unit took over
guard duties. " It is true they were in the vicinity for some
considerable time but presuraably they were doing external guard duties
or may even have been doing training at the Tank Training School in
the neighbourhood.	s<

and ‘thea another camp in Silesia, and arrived at No* 1 Ga^? in Belsco on 8th
April 1945 viaere I lived in Block 12.
2,	I reoen&er the morning of 15th April 1945, the day of oxx
liberation*	We imd had no food for two days, and found our task of burying
the corpses very hard. Capos mre pressing us on. While we were employed in
this task we passed a pile of tumip peelings. Some of us went to take peelinf^s
off the pile. There was a Hungarian soldier posted about 20 metres amy:
without any warning lie fired at ay friend Doctor SCBCNSTEIIiS, who fell down
thereupon. The Hungarian soldier then approached, and when, he saw that
SCHdtSTEIN ms still alive, fired tco more shots into his ]x>dy. I tried to
run away with the others, but an S.S. rsm\ and a Capo called me back with a man
named i$0SES and another man, and ordered uo to carry SCHCUSTEBI* s body away
and place it on a pile of corpses.
5.	I saw the Hungarian soldier tire at XHCNSTUN and I saw three
bullet wounds in SCHOHSTTiHT* s body - one te the head, one in the stoiaaoh aid

the third in the^ssete*
i do not knovr the n nes of the Hungarian soldier, the 8.3, man or

On the 15th April 194-5 the accused shot two Polish internees at Belsen Camp.
\
PARTICULARS OF ALLEGED CRIME
About 2 p.m. on the 15th April 1945 a number of Polish internees came out of
their block in Belsen Camp and went into the cellar of the kitchen. The accused
gave orders to two Hungarians namely SIPOS and BRAUNITZER to go down into the cellar
and shoot the Poles. The two soldiers refused and the accused then took one of the
guards rifles and himself went down into the cellar. Three or four shots were
heard to be fired and the accused then emerged from the cellar and announced that
he had shot two of the Poles. Two dead Poles with bullet wounds near their hearts
were brought out of the cellar by other internees about 7 o’clock in the evening
of the same day.

PARTICULARS OF EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT
Contained in the affidavits of Ferenc HOLZHAUSSR AND Jozsef SZANTO
(copies of which are attached).

NOTES ON THE CASE
The case is complete.
The two Hungarian soldiers who disobeyed the order to shoot the Poles
were apparently later punished for disobeying this order. They have both deserted
from the Hungarian Army and have been reported to CROWCASS as being wanted for
interrogation.

14th April 1945 the accused murdered Bella Freundlieh an inmate of Belsen
Concentration Camp.
PARTICULARS OP ALLEGED CRIME
On the 14th April 1945 Bella Freundlich was with her cousin Vilma Freundlich
near a large pile of canrots beside one of the Kitchens at Belsen Concentration Camp.
She was picking up carrots to take away as food when she was shot by the accused in
cold blood. *	,

./NOTES﻿NOTES OR THE CASE
The case is complete.	W*
The probable defence will be that Bella Preundlich was within the prohibit^
distance from the wire and that the accused shot her in accordance with the orders
received by him from the Germans when the Hungarian company took over guard duty.
This defence would appear to be without substance because according to Gyula PORCIS
the accused did not call upon Bella Preundlich to stop before shooting nor is there
any evidence that she was in fact near the wire. Having regard to the evidence about
the substitution of less severe orders to the guards relating to the shooting of
internees it would appear that the accused's own conscience is not very clear.﻿27 July 194-5

I note that no British subject is involved in these

It is possible that the filing of such cases may raise
questions by other National Offices as to the right of the
British to deal with these cases in view of the Moscow
Declaration. It would assist us if we could be informed
of the arrangements which resulted in the Belsen cases being
undertaken by your department, and the authority behind them.
Possibly this matter will come up for discussion at
the meeting at Hobart House this afternoon.

SUBJECT:- War Crimes - BELSEN
Ref your MD/jAG/FS/l2/l(D) dated 1 Aug
1. With regard to Jozef FORGACH referred to in the	paragraph of
your letter, information has now reached this Branch that he is involved
in the massacre of a Jugoslav village. A search of his belongings produced
two swastika badges and a considerable amount of Nazi literature, and in view
of this, he has been taken into custody and the matter is being investigated
by the Jugoslavian War Crimes Team. He will not be handed over, however,
as long as he is required as a witness of the Hungarian activities at BEL&SN.
2. With reference to your second paragraph, it is agreed that no charge
is possible regarding the shooting of Esther HEILBRUNM and Doctor SGHONSTEIN,
unless further evidence is forthcoming.
3. Finally, with regard to the three Hungarian Colonels, no allegation
is made against Colonel BERGSENYI, who is still at liberty.
If. With regard to the other two Colonels, it is agreed that no charge
of war crime can be made against them, at any rate for the present, but as
it was abundantly clear that the activities of these two officers were
greatly prejudicing investigations and preventing possible witnesses from
coming forward, they have been taken into custody.

the papers in, this case have been forwarded to you for regis-

convene courts for the trials of war criminals regardless of the
nationality of the victim.
2. In view, however, of your representative’s observations
at the meeting with iiajor-Gen. Bridgeman on 2 August 1945 it
would appear that the British National Office does not wish to
receive cases where British subjects are not involved nor does
the United Nations Wax Crimes Commission wish to have any know-

REPORT BY PROSECUTOR IN WAR CRIMES TRIALS OP
Lieutenant PATO and Lieutenant UJVARI.
Lieutenant PATO.
The trial of this Yfar Criminal started at CELLE on 3 Bee 45 and finished
on 6 Dec 45. He was charged with killing two unknown Allied Nationals at
HSLSEN on 15 Apr 45, and found not guilty. There were only two witnesses
for the prosecution, and both of them were private soldiers in the Hungarian
Army - one aged 17, the other 18 - who at the relevant time Yrere in the
Platoon commanded by the accused officer. Their evidence was substantially
the same as that contained in the statements they made in July, and both of
them were cross-examined at very great length (4 and hours respectively).
On conclusion of this cross-examination, not only had they completely contradicted
each other on very material points, but also themselves 'with complete ingenuousness.
In brief each showed himself unworthy of credence and hopelessly unhat'wwn|
The accused himself gave evidence on oath and denied the allegations without
being shaken by subsequent questioning. A great number of witnesses ’were also
called by the defence to show that the relations between officers and men in
the Hungarian Army since the British occupation had approached a state of open
insubordination, and that the men had been incited to bring charges against
their officers, be they true or false. Furthermore, it was significant that
neither of the two prosecution witnesses had seen fit to report the incidentals
and apparently none of the internees who Wire alleged to have witnessed it had
reported the matter either.

Short of the accused convicting himself out of his own mouth, it was
difficult to see how the court could reach any other verdict on conclusion of
the case for the prosecution.
2. Lieutenant UJVARI.
The trial of this war criminal started at GELLE on 6 Dec 45 a^d finished on
7 Dec 45. He was charged with killing a certain Bella EPEUNDLICH, who was
alleged to be an Allied National, at BELSEN on 14 Apr 45, and was found not guilty.
There wese only two witnesses of the actual shooting, and it appeared extremely
doubtful from the abstract of evidence whether in fact these two were ad idem.
One of them was the deceased's cousin, Vilma PREUNDLICH, and she described in her
affidavit how Bella was shot by the accused officer when they were both collecting
carrots from a pile of rotten vegetables between two kitchens at about noon on
14 Apr 45. The other witness, a Hungarian soldier1 named PORKIS, described in
his affidavit how two or three days before the English arrived (15 Apr 45) he
saw the accused shoot two women who were approaching the wire perimeter of the ce
I spoke to this witness before the trial, and it was quite clear that he was, in
(j fact, referring to a different occasion, and the two women he saw shot were at
least 70 metres from any buildings, and that there were not any piles of,rotten
vegetables anywhere in the vicinity. In these circumstances I did not call
PORKIS, and the case for the prosecution virtually rested on the affidavit of
Vilma EREUNDLICH, who had not'been foundmd could not, therefore, give evidence in
person. Four other witnesses, whose affidavits were part of the abstract, were
also not called. Each of these gave evidence of certain guard orders covering
the duties of sentries in preventing internees escaping through the wire. In
view of the fact that there was no suggestion that Bella FREUNDLICH was trying to
escape when shot, and that the defence was that no shooting in fact took place,
the evidence of these four seemed quite irrelevant.
The accused himself gave evidence on oath and accounted for his movements on
the day in question, and various witnesses were called to support him. Although
his answers under cross-examination were at times unconvincing, the case for the
prosecution was still nothing more than the affidavit of an unseen Rumanian woman,
and the verdict of the court could hardly ever have been in doubt.
A further difficulty in this w;ise was that the court had to be asked to infer
that Bella FREUNDLIOH was a Rumanian by virtue of the fact that her cousin was one.
Although the particulars of the charge alleged her to be an Allied National, at
'ti the best Bella FKSUNDLICH was a co-belligerent.	j ^ :	(

We have received an enquiry from the Legation
at Budapest asking for information about an alleged
Hungarian war criminal called Ujvary. I wonder if
you would be kind enough, to tell me whether this man
has been tried before a British Military Court in
Germany or Austria, and if so whether he is at pre-
sent serving a sentence. The Hungarians want him
to be charged with the murder of a Dr. Schoenstein in
the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 12th April
1945.
As you no doubt know His Majesty’s Government does
not recognise the right of the Hungarian Government
to request extradition to Hungary from territory
under British control. It is however thought that we
ought to tell the Hungarians whether Ujvary has or has
nofe>been dealt with by our Courts. He may not of

NOTES ON THE USE OF BRANCH MEMORANDA
(See paragraphs 160—165 Office Instructions, 1943)
1.	The existence and movements of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NOT recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a) ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.v simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
(i) INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ’’ records or discussions within a direc-
torate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or may
not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c) COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways
(a) By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
{b) By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.
4.	The branch originating a B.M. must be informed, if the B.M. is registered, or inserted in
a registered file, by another branch.

Osdst Offioer QESAl
aid Serjeant KISS
of the IsUiigarian Forces.
I am instructed by the Judge Advocate general of the Forces to return
this case which , as referred here by the B»J.A.G. at your Headquarters.
1.	The Judge Advocate General has instructed me to convey to you the
following advice with regard to the case s
2.	As no British Nationals are involved in this ease it has not been
submitted to the British National ffice. It is not at present dear that
the internees referred to In the charges were in fact Allied Nationals
although this may well be so. It is essential to prove at the trial that
some at least of them were Allied Nationals (otherwise no Far Crime has been
committed) and a witness or witnesses mat be called to give evidence to
this effect.
3. Subject to paragraph 2 above in opinion the evidence justifies the
trial by Military Court under the Foyal Warrant of the above-named Cadet
Officer OKSAY on the following charge :~
Charge?	C0i#IIITING A WM CHIME
in that he
at Belsen in Oeri-aany on	or	©bait 29	April 1%5	in violation of the laws and
usages of war did shoot	at	a number	of unarmed	civilian internees Allied
Nationals.
4« I *» further of opiniesi that Serjeant KISS shaild be tried upon the
following charge s~
Charge;	OarlTTIHG A WAP, CHIME
in that he
*
at Belsen in Germany on	or	about 13	April 1%5	in violation .of the laws aid
usages of war did shoot	at	a number	of unarmed	civilian internees Allied
Nationals wounding one thereof.
5. In each case the accused stolid be attached to a unit md the
Commanding Officer should slfyi the Charge Sheet as such in accordance with
paragraph 4 of the l egulatione for the Trial of War Orirainals as set ait
in Army Order 81 of 1945,
6. In the heeding of the Charge Sheet in each case the accused should be
described as "of the Hungarian Axsqt in charge of.....(unit)..." pursuant to
/F egulati on

i

﻿- 2 -
Regulation 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of ‘.far Griuiinala.
7.	Yiith regard to the evidence In the case of Cadet Officer CESAI the
following witnesses should he called to give evidence :-
(i) Gulyas Pal, who should give evidence in accordance with hi* affidavit
omitting the fact that the Hungarian soldier who was
wounded later died of typhus;
(ii) Major Lasalo, who should give evidence In accordance with his
affidavit cualtting the feet that the Hungarian soldier
mho was wounded later died of typhus,
8.	With regard to the evidence in the case of Serjeant HISS the following vdt~
nesses should be celled to give evidence at the trial s-
(I) Oren Ferenc, who should give evidence in acoordano® vi th Ids affidavitJ
(ii) Juhasis L-J'-Szlo, who should give evidence in accordance with his affidavit.
9.	The Judge Advocate General has further instructed m to say that he does not
consider these are cases in which ho should depute a judge advocate to advise th®
court. Nor does he consider that a judge advocate is necessary. In these circuju-
stanccs one of the members of th® court should have legal qualifications in accord-
ance with I ule of Procedure 93(B). You will dbubtlsss make application to D.J.A.G.
at your Headquarters for the appointment of such an officer. SirsHarly, it is con-
sidered that the prosecution should b© conducted by an officer with legal qi&Lifica-
tions, and application should be made to D.J.A.G-, for th© appointment of arch an
officer.
10.	In each case, in iqy opinion, all witnesses should give svLdenoe orally at
the trial, but if any of the witnesses are not available the affidavits made by
them can be put in by rosecution.
11.	In my opinion these accused should be offered the services of an officer
with legal qualifications to defend theta at their trials. I think that the
accused should be supplied with a copy of the affidavits referred to in paragraphs
7 and 8 above. At the sera® time they should be offered the services of an
interpreter if they so desire. One copy of the charge sheet and abstract o€
evidence in each case will be required for the use of the prosecutor.
12.	I enclose the original affidavits of the witnesses referred to above.
13.	An impartial person competent to act as interpreter in the Hungarian
language should be available at the trial of Cadet Officer Gksay and impartial
persons ccrapeteilt to act as interpreters in the Hungarian and l omaaniaa
languages should b© available at the trial of Serjeant Kiss.

Reference jropr 3A0R/15228/2/C.Ilf6 dated
4 September 1945.
1.	I rhave to-day forwarded to,the cp'gfflander-in-Chief
final advice in the case of Cadet Officer Yajna.
2.	With regard to'the cassi'against Lieut.S-oinbos
in the absence of any evidence that there was no other
means open to that officer to prevent the escape of the
internee referred to in the Affidavit of Jozef Borsos
than to order the soldier Borsos to shoot at the internee
I cannot advise that any"charge be ’preferred against'
Lieut. Gombos.	I understand that-after the liberation
of Belsen camp steps were taken to prevent the escape of
internees dn order to avoid the spreading of disease in
the surrounding neighbourhood. Whilst Lieut.Gombos'a
action in ordering the guard to shoot at the escaping
internee-may have been somewhat" drastic it Vfould be open
to him to justify this action on the grounds that there
was no other-means of•preventing the escape of the internee
in question.﻿As the shooting took place after the liberation
of' the camp this incident could not in my opinion be made
the subject of a charge of committing a war crime.

1.	It is considered that it would he undesirable to hold
at BERG-M BELSEN itself the tria]s of BELSEW staff still in
custody. The presence of large nuiiibers of DPs in the immediate
neighbourhood is a potential threat to good order in the event
of any of these trials ending in acquittal, or sentences which
are considered too light by DP public opinion.
2,,	This Branch will therefore recommend to 30 Corps District
that these trials should be held at CELLE.
3.	If these cases are all dealt with individually there will
be inevitable delay In their completion. It is considered that:-
(a)	Cases should only be tried individually when an
individual is charged with a specific crime NOT
in conjunction with another accused.
(b)	When persons are concerned in the same crime they
should be tried jointly in groups of five or
thereabouts if more than nine persons are involved.

1. You will by now have had an opportunity of discussing with Major SfS®4Sf
the proposal that the second BSiSS? trial should be tried at mmm itself where
they are all in custody and that they should bo tried individually by a court
sitting flora day to day.
2* I inforrsefi A(l3S,4) that X proposed to put this suggestion to you when the
ease being prepared here is finally sub atted and they have coi.saunicated their
view as fbllowsj-
'It is considered that it would be undesirable to hold at fflSXSBS HBISffii
itself the trials of BESS? staff still In custody. Tire presaao© of
large massbers of Dl's in the imodiate neighourhood is a potential threat
to good order in the event of ar\y of these tilals ending in acquittal,
or sentences which are considered too light by DP pi*lie opinion.
This Brandi will therefore recosmend to 3<> Corps District tlmt these
trials should be held at GBSmM>
If these cases ar® all dealt with individually there will be inevitable
delay in their completion. It is considered that?-
'	(a) Oases should only be tried individually when an
individual is charged with a specific crime Jut-X
in conjunction wito another accused.
(b) When persons are concerned in the same crime they
should be tried Jointly in groups of five or
thereabouts if aore than nine persons ar© involved.
It is requested that you will bear this in mind when preparing these cases.
3.	As to the holding of the trial at M£S® itself, that is a natter ot Adm
ooOTonieBc©; th® accused all lod^o	and th© taan wiilch 1b dsaHtig ^/ith th@
case is also quartered there. Incidentally, the 00 of that Team gave me to
understand that the local authorities welcome the idea that any further trial should
be held there.
4.	With regard to the Joining of the accused, I do not agree with A(iS.4) and
I believe that the simpler and most speedy process would be to tiy them individually.
There are no cases that I aia aware of in which two Kapos together Joined in a
beating. The affidavits at present are against Kayos for beating in-mateo A, B,
0 and D ©t;o*
I pro ose to have these affidavits brotoen down so that each affidavit shows
a distinct crime agaimt on® accused.	Naturally, if there ms evidence
implicating two persons in one crime, we should Join thaa together,
5.	It should be borne in mind that A(E3.4) have never seen any of these
affidavits and do not really appreciate the difference between toying X	for
concerting together in the killing of A B and G, each of whom has aade affidavits
involving X with ABO, Y with ABGanda w%%hkKG	^Jd/or
evidence so that a clear-cut case is shown against X with evidence oi A anq^or

Affidavits of two witnesses - no witnesses present in pevaon.
w V /
4. Kt-JAdCMS FOR ACQUITTAL: Both affidavits lacked any identifioa;,ion of the accused,
for although he was mentioned by name there was no indication that the man named was
the accused, apart from the identity of names. The Court, therefore, on a submission
of the defence, found that no case had been made out against the accused, and acquitted
him.
5. pomes ARI'dINQ CUT OP THE THIhh;
(a)	In the absence of witnesses in person, the finding of the Court v/as inevitable
on account of the lack of proper identification of the accused. The deponents when
swearing the affidavits should have Identified the accused by a photograph which could
have been attached to the affidavit, and the prosecution would then have had a case.
(b)	Even had the case gone further than it did a conviction would have been equally
remote, for the defence had six witnesses attending the Court in person, and no Court
would have been willing to convict on two affidavits which contained discrepancies
against six living witnesses who it appears were prepared to swear that they had been
with the accused on the day in question and had never seen him shoot at anything.
(c) The discrepancy in the affidavits comisted in the deponents stating in the
one case that the accused had used a rifle, in the other case that he had used a pistol
- a material discrepancy which made the case weak in itself apart from the lack of
identification.

1* I am a Polish Jew and 35 years of age. I ms arrested on 27th. August
n
19A3 in Bendsburg and ms brought to Auschwitz. I ms^j^wedcs in Auschwitz
then transferred to a camp nearby at Lagisa. I ms 1here about 6*r months
when I escaped about the end of May 1944-. I ms recaptured in July 1944 and
held in solitary confinement at Auschwitz until December 1944* I ms then
taken to a camp in the middle of Germany called LangatSalze where I was in a
punishment company. I was there two months until the beginning of February 1945
fee**. rv.feu^.fewv to tc. C*^y\aJ , iCiu-s.
when I was transferred to Boloont I came direct to C&nrp2. and at that time
the Hungarian soMSars were living in Camp 3*
2. Some days before the British came the Hungarians took over the guarding
of the camp* They were working with the SS. I was living in Block 87
and between Block 87 and Block 86 there was a kitchen. Outside the kitchen
there were hjna in which the refuse of food was put* The Hungarians were all
/4vv%a£7
round the kitchen and there was also a^patrol walking round the camp.
The internees who were ravenously hungry were trying to get food out of the
teu^U	o
refuse bins-and also potatoes fpesaythe kitchen cellar^ /^he Hungarians were
^	with rifles and pistols
shooting at the internees around the swill bins and the cellas/. Many pepple
gell and the others ran away. I, with some other of the internees, were
detailed to remove the bodies of those who were dead and put th$n in a ditch
near the kitchen. Those who were still alive were taken to the hospital •
I know the names of two who were killed. These are, Slama Wolfowicz and
shooting
Popowicz. The body of Wolfowicz I myself placed in the ditch. This/bent on
spasmodically throughout the 13£h, 14> and 15th. •Febsuany 1945, whenever the
internees tried to get food from the swill bins or the kitchen cellar.
There were 77 killed in the three days and they all came from Blocks 86 to 91.
I was careful to make a check of the figures of those killed because I thought
the information might be useful as evidence if I ever got free:

STATEMENT
•by Pfce Julius Thot, bom the 11.8.1925 in Nova Straze
now in the Hungarian Army in Belsen.
After being cautioned to tell only the truth, he made
the following statement;-
I am now here 8 months as a soldier of the Hungarian Amy.
I know, Lt GUMBOS who was also in Hungary with my platoon.
After the British Troops arrived, my friends complained to
me that they are forced to do guard/m the concentration camp
Belsen and that Lt C&BOS gave them the strict order to shoot
at the prisoners, who would try to leave the camp and to Kill
them. He also added, that he would have them_ (the Hungarian
soldiers) shot, if they would not kill the prisoners, who were
trying to get out of the camp. I heard it from MORAS,Istvan,
BOESOS Josef, OKEN Ferenc, all here with Troop Nr 5. ^egt Nr ^
Hungarian Amy in Belsen.
(Sgd) Julius TOTH,﻿8.8.1945
STATEMENT
"by Julius Ivanic, bom the 28.4.1921 in Bela.
After being cautioned to tell only the truth he made
the following statement:
I am now 8 months stationed in Belsen as soldier of
the Hungarian Amy. I know Lt GUMBOS from flungary where I
was serving in his platoon.
After the arrival of the British Troops, I was also
on guard duty at the concentration carap Belsen - camp Ho.2.
I remember quite well, being on guard duty with my comrade, one
evening, that GflMBOS came round riding on a bicycle and gave
us the strict order to shoot immediately at the prisoners in
case they should try to leave the block or if they should approach
us nearer than 20m. I answered that B feel unable to shoot
them because I regard them as the same human beings as myself.
CtSMBOS said, If you wont shoot, 1 will shoot you myself."
(Sgd) Julius IVMIC﻿10.8.45
by OEM, Frantisek, bom 23.6.1922 in Velke Vsi
stationed now with the Hungarian Amy in Belsen.
Approximately the 13th April 1945, two days before British troops
arrived, we received orders to guard the prisoners of this
concentration camp. We were warned to treat the prisoners in the
most cruel way. The order was given by Lt G-OMBOS, O.C. Troop.
We were posted near the cookhouse round camp Nr.2. We had special
orders to break up all groups, besides that, we vrere told to
shoot immediately at the people in case they should assemble in
gx’oups over 40 persons. We were watcued by Lt GOMBOb and the other
officers. Those were armed with pistols. Lach of the guards had a
rifle, 40 rounds of ammunition and 2 hand grenades. We warned the
prisoners not to approach us in the presence of officers.
(Sgd) Frantisek OEESN﻿f
STATEfelMT
HORAE Istvan, bom 22. 8.1911 in Earaucs-N©wgorod
At the guard mounting in the Gamp of Belsen, we
received orders from the Hungarian Colonel (i iergot his name)
who before spoke with the SS Officer POKGRATZ? not to allow
any prisoners to approach us nearer than 6 metres and should
it happen, to shoot immediately. He said that they were thieves
murderers and bandits from all over the world. He said
further to aim well and kill them. The troop was later taken
over by Lt GUMBOS, who changed the order not to allow the
prisoners to approach us nearer than 6 metres, but should they,
come nearer than 15 metres to shoot immediately, tfe also received
orders to shoot even if the prisoners were farther away.m case
they should walk in the direction of the entrance of the camp.
This order was given before the British troops arrived and
stayed in force even after that. This order was repeated at
evexy guard mounting. After the British arrived, some of the
prisoners escaped to the Russian Camp and were shot at by
GUMBOS with his pistol. He walked be.tween the guards and went
even in the Russian Camp shooting all the time.
I have seen him itself, shooting at people. G&BOS shoot
was, at this occasion, shouting at us: "Shoot on my responsibility/
the British gave the order".
(Sgd) MORAR, Istvan﻿10.8.1945
STATEMENT
by B0RS0S Josef, bom 26.2.1918 in Solnok.
X have observed cases of shooting between Block MB 90
and the Russian part of the cainp. X saw how G-OMBOS entered
a house in the so called Russian Zone of Gamp Nr. 2, drove
the Jews out, then he entered the block and started shooting
in the rooms. He was also shooting on the main road before
Block MB 78. There he gave the order "Shoot, or I will shoot
you".﻿

in ordering the guard to shoot at the escaping internes may have
been somewhat drastic it would be open to him to justify this

1.	Bef your letter BnOR715228/2/0 1197/3AG of the 12. Peb 46
regarding the a/n. The wording of the	is as follows :-
"Unauthorised use of a Firearm contrary to
Ordinance 1., Art. 1, Sec 10.
Bor that he at Belsen on or about the 15. April 45
did fire a revolver at Allied Nationals."
2.	The evidence obtained is conflicting dates varying and
will be "Sworn Statements” as 5 of the 4 witnesses are repatriated
to Hungary.
5..	Our difficulty is that being an undischarged Member of the
Hungarian Army we know of HO directive under which we can proceed.
It is knovm Ord.I. was not posted.
4.	This case was being dealt with as a "War Crime” but since
the offence is alleged to have occurred the "day” after the
occupation, the onus of trying the Case was placed on Mil Gov.
5.	Lt Col. Tilling informed me personally this man was also

2.	In view of the matter disclosed therein I have made some
i vestigations into the reasons for this man's detemio and
the follfflwgng appears to be the position ;-
a)	He	was first arrested on 31 July	45 by Sgt. 13118612
H.	AITCHISON of No. 1 War Crimes	Investigation Team.	The
War Crimes Arrest Report gives no indicatio of the
reaso ; for his arrest, merely stating "War Crimi al".
b)	He	was transferred to E3TERWEGEN	CIC on 8 Sep. 45.
c)	On	7 Novr. 45 he was sent back to the local Priso: .
d)	On	16 Jan. 46 he was handed over	to Col. BEKCSINGI, O.C.
of the Hungarian Camp WOLESBURG.
e)	He was brought back to prison here on 7 Eeb.46.
3.	Apparently GOMBOS was a Lt. in the Hungarian Army and the
prison Authorities are of the opinion that he is wanted by either
the Hungarian or Czech War Crimes Commission.
4.	Authority for his release or transfer to a CIC is urgently
requested.

Ref your letter of the 4 S’eb 46 WC/fe/1 ^ r egarding the appearance at
Court of the above named War Criminal, a Eungarlali Officer.
Ref your para 2 (a)
COMBOS appeared before the Summary Court at CELLS about 22nd Dec 45
when the charge was reed over him and reminded until the 2nd Jan 46, so that
a whole day could be given to the case. During the interval arrangements were
made through H#Q* 43 Biv. Celle for the man to be defended. He chose a Brlti. h
Officer, then Lt, How Gapt Eli S, 7 Hants Regt.
On the 2 Jan 46, before the court was about to sit it v/a^ realised that
GOLDOS, being a Hungarian Officer and not discharged, placed the Court in
difficulty as to the correct procedure to adopt at his trial. Nothing could
be found whereby a liil Gov could try him for the offence. Ref was made to
Legal Branch, Hannover, 30 Corps and latfer to Legal, LUneburg.
Capt CLARE, Legal Branch, Ltineburg, saw the Case records and state-
ments. One feature which case to light was that no proof could be obtain®!
whether or not OrdiaaiKse ho, 1, had been posted in the Camp, Also, that
it has been rejected as a bar Crime. He gave the decision to drop the case,
43 Biv, H#Qtr# were informed, '.'her© were 3 witnesses for irosecution and 22
for Defence.
GCL-dOS was held ere for a further 14 days and then transferred to the
Hungarian Cmp at Holfsburg for safe custody. Instructions were given to hold.
The same day instructions were received from Lt Col Tilling that Signal had
been received stating GCHBOS was required by Csedio-Slovalda as a War Criminal.
Immediate instruct! ns were given to the Camp Cotniaandant, Wolfsburg, to hold
pending escort and transfer to CELLE Prison.
GCMBOS held in CELLE • risen until instructions are received from higher
authority as to procedure and final disposal.

and :ut in prison. After three vrooks I was tr nsferred to Ausohwits whe -e I
regained until the beginning of July 1944 and was tlien sent to Buohenwald*
1 only remained at this oas^o for a few d^ys and I w s then moved to teo cam s
near Leipzig, first to Seits -nd then to g-ergoelster, I was then trinsferred
back to Bucheravrld in Kovtsdber 1944 Jad arrived at Belsen on 21st, January 1943.

Investigation feay, 1 visited Belsen Detention Cells and there recognised a man
whoa I knew as ISA &• I era now told that his full name is Id .:4 JUHLEH.^si.
He was a Capo in ilo.l Czazg at Belsen.
3s	I Uvea in the same Block as JCDfilBSSKT at Belsen, this was Block
Ko.2, and he was the Deputy Blockleuder and Capo of the sleeping u rters. He
pretended not to be a Jot and was extremely brutal in his treatment of the Jewisli
prisoners. X have seen Mm beating sick and half starved prisoners with the
buckle part of his belt or a wooden board token from^ie bed itsexf.
Ehese beatings wore so serious that in ay opinion they must h ve caused numerous
deaths,
Before and after marling Appel he would go round the slee ing
quarters and ba% the sick people who werelying in their bunks unable to got up.
He vrauld beat then with tte buckle part of his bolt and ,-.hilst beating them
he would drag them to the floor and continue to beat them. In many oases
I have seen them left in an unconscious st te on the fl&or. She hut ordcrlhs
would pick up the victims and put them back on the bed. Borne days, when an
internee doctor ms present, he would examine the victims and, if still living,
would put them back into their bunks or, if dead, have their bodies removed.
,	x xwzmfoer an occasion when I was present at the beating of one
of these prisoners which mused his death. About the riddle of Jfcrch I saw
-1-﻿JIIO Lj./jSS enter t3i© sleeping eunrtens an . he went to a sick prisoner on the

on the mouth and f/.<oe and the prisoner lent down from the bed and colic.; >sed
unconscious on the floor. JlB&hBKSff contimod to beat him with the belt
for about 1§ minutes and also kicked him with Ms boots. After he had loft the ro<
I and several of ngr oomre es went to fetch the internee doctor. Dr. Konig, who has

DEPOSITION OF MIKLOS HIRSCH (male) late of Antes, near Des, Rumania,
sworn before ^ajor Thomas Humphrey Tilling, Royal Artillery, Legal
ataff. No.1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1.	I am 21 years of age and a Rumanian. I was arrested in
May 1944 and taken to the Ghetto at Des. I was transferred to Auschwitz
on 26th May 1944 and left there for Buchenwald at the beginning of June
1944. After spending 4 days at Buchenwald, I was sent to Zeitz and
Bergoelster Labour Camps, both of which are near Leipzig. I was sent
back to Buchenwald in November 1944 and arrived at Belsen at 21st
January 1945.
2.	On 22nd August 1945, in company with Lieutenant H.H. Alexander,
Pioneer Corps, 21 Army Group Interpreters Pool, attached to No.l “ar
'-'rimes Investigation Team, I visited Belsen Detention Cells and there
recognised a man whom I knew as ISAAK. I am now told that his full name
is ISAAK JUDALEWSKY. He was a Capo in No.l Camp at Belsen.
3.	At Belsen I lived in Block No. 2 and JUDALEWSKY was Deputy
Blockleader and Capo of the sleeping quarters in this Block, "s I was
in the Block all day long x had ample opportunity of watching JUDALEWSKY.
I have seen him daily beating and ill-treating sick prisoners and a
number of his victims collapsed under the blows and had to be taken to
their bunks. In my opinion these beatings helped to shorten the lives
of the half-starved and sick people.
4.	I remember one particular occasion after the morning ^ppel when]
JUDALEWSKY entered the block and found a sick man in his bunk. He then
proceeded to beat this man with a wooden board and the sick man jumped
down from his bed, JUDALEWSKY then continued to beat him. I left the
hut whilst the beating was in progress but after a while I- was called
back to collect a dead corpse from the floor. I had to carry the body
to the shed near Block 2 where the dead were collected. lam convinced
that this was the body of the sick man as the hut had been cleared of allj
the dead poeple shortly before JUDALEWSKY entered the quarters. When 1
returned to the quarters this was the only corpse there.
5#	I have often seen prisoners taken into JUDALEWSKY’s room﻿adjoining the sleeping quarters and 1 have heard their screams. After
a while they would leave the room with blood over their faces or with
bruises.

You are charged with the foil.owing offences;"
(i) At Belsen, about the middle of March 1 945-, murder by beating
a fellow internee until.he died.
(ii) Beating fellow internees at various dates at Belsen. ■
Do you understand the charges made against you?
REPLY	Yes.
CAUTIONED. You need not say anything, but if you do want to make a statement
I will write it down, get you to signe it, and it may be usea in
evidence at your trial.
Do you wich to make a statement?
REPLY	Yes.
STATEMENT	About the nan I have killed and the people I haveJbeaten.
"	i would like to know the name of the person whom i have killed
as I do not know anything about having killed anyone.
I have beaten people, I agree, but only because it was
necessary to keep the block clean when people refused to do i^«
Por instance I saw a prisoner cone in with dirty boo-cs and he
was going to bed in his boots. I asked him to take his boots
off and I said "The block must be kept clean and you must take
off your bjots". He refused to do this so I had to beat him#
Ydien the people made the block dirty by rex using uo g^ uo
the lavatory I was woken up to restore order in the Block.^ Hie
prisoners themselves asked me to restore order and I was afrain.
some 33 Blockleaders would cone and see it so I hau. to punish
people like that. On another occasion one of the prisoners^ _
stole bread from another prisoner and I was asked to punish him
because I was responsible for order in the block. I was always
asked by the Blockleader to keep order and I was responsible
for such order to the Blockleo.der and to the 33 guards.
v have never beaten people because I am a saaist or because
I liked it, but because I had to do it,
I would like you to help me and to let me free.
Would you like to call any witnesses in your defence?
reply	There were only Russian and Polish people in the block and they
are not here now-, I would like to call the Block leader of
Block 2 in my defence, but I only know that his name is FRANEK -
that is his Christian name — e.nd he was a Slovakian. I do not
know the names of anyone else.

DEPOSITION OF HAROLD OSMOND Le DKUILLBEEC
1.	I, HAROLD OSMOND Lo DRUIDLENEC, at present at Horton Hospital,
Epsom, Surrey, with permanent address at No 7 Trinity Road, St. Helier,
Jersey, schoolmaster, make oath and say as follows
2.	On 3 June 1944 I was arrested by the Germans at St . Helier and taken
to the JACQUE CARTIER Prison near RHEIMS, Prance. I stayed there about
a week when I was taken with other prisoners to BELFORT._ I stayed
thepe about fourteen days. From there I was sent to NEUERGAMME
Concentration Camp, arriving there about the beginning of September. CE
was next taken to WILHELMSHAVEN where I stayed until the 2nd April 194B.
On that day I and several hundred other prisoners were sent to BELSEN
Concentration Camp, arriving there after a few days journey.
3.	On arriving at BELSEN we were offered some soup in exchange for
either bread or cigarettes and only those prisoners who could give up
some broad or cigarettes 'were able to obtain^ soup. we were taken, to
our blocks. I was in block 12. The v/hole camp was grossly^ overcrowded
and at night six hundred of us were locked in a nut which might have
qccommodated one hundred. There was not sufficient room to lie down
and vice had to spend the night sitting up and jammed up against each others
At least eight or nine prisoners died each night. A11 the^internees
in my block were men, mostly Russians and Poles with some trench and
a mixture of other European races.
4.	At 3-30 a.m. we had to get up and go on Appel-parade-where we
had to stand to attention until 8 a.m,	were then formed into parties
of .five and started dragging corpses to the burial pits. There were
thousands of corpses lying in hepps almost all over the camp.
5.	The German SS personnel - guards and others - were brutal.to all
prisoners. Every guar4 carried a stick or a piece of wood with which
they continually beat internees on the head for no reason at all. I
myself was beaten many times by the camp staff but I cannot say the
names of any of the guards as I never knew their names.
6.	Prisoners were shot out of hand indiscriminately, again for no
reason at all, and all day shots could be heard all over the camp.
Prisoners who were shot or beaten to death were left lying on the^ground
until some time later when their bodies were taken off to the burial pits .
7.	During my first four days at BELSEN I received, in all not more
than one pint of watery swede soup and one mug of water. During my
last five days before the British troops entered the camp I had nothing
to eat and nothing to drink.
8.	Whilst dragging corpses to tho burial pits I noticed that in
many cases a piece of flesh had been cut off the body, generally from
the back of the thigh and I was told that the flesh had been^cut off
and eaten. I myself saw on several occasions internees cutting flesh
off corpses and stuffing it into their mouths, eating it like animals.
9.	I cannot say the names or .nationalities of any of the
internees whom I saw killed or beaten as we did not know each others
names or nationality. Nor can I identify any of the guards who beat
and killed internees. I can only say that all the guards and officials
habitually ill treated all internees in this way.

DEPOSITION OP BRIGADIER BD'GH' LLEWELLYN GLYN HUGHES , G .B .E .',D ,S .0 , ,M, G.,
Deputy Director of Medical Services, Second. Array, sworn before Lieuten-
ant Colonel Leopold. John Oenn, Royal Artillery, Goramariding No.l War
Criines Investigation Team.
1.	I have made ;a full and detailed report of the conditions pertaining
in BELSEN Gamp, a copy of which is in the- hands of all relevant author-
ities and as to which I swore an Affidavit before Judge Advocate General,
v'ar Office, on 15th June 1945.
2.	On 15th ^pril 1945, in the early afternoon, I entered BELSEN Gamp
under the terms of the Truce of that day's date, in my capacity as Deputy
Director of Medical Services, Second, -^rmy,
3.	At approximately 1800 hours on the afternoon of 15th 'April 1945 I
was interrogating JOSEF KRaMER, Commandant of BELSEN 'Gamp, in company .
with Lieutenant-colonel Richard Taylor,D .3.0 . , Royal Artillery, Command-
ing 63rd Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery, a Buttery of which Regt
provided the first British troops to do duty in BELSEN Gamp.
4.	At about this time a runner came to report shooting by S3 Guards
at the Western end of'the Men’s' Gamp, X. proceeded immediately to the
spot in company with Lieutenant-colonel Taylor, taking JOSEF KRAMER
with us.
5.	At the Western end of the Men's Gamp, some thirty yards due East
of the Gate leading thence to the crematorium, I found a stack of straw
covered potato plants, A number of male internees of the Gamp were
foraging in the stack for food. Surrounding them were three or four
individual members of the SS Guards of the Camp armed with automatic
weapons of Sten Gun type, "s I approached the spot I saw and, heard them
firing single shots at the aforesaid internees and they made no attempt
to cease firing when I came up to them,JOSEF KaRMER made no attempt to
prevent them or to interfere.
6.	Such firing was indiscriminate and gave the impression of being
a customary paiime. Several dead and dying internees were lying on
and around the potato stack, I saw one or two fall as a result of the
firing as I approached, I am unable to identify the SS Guards respons-
ible -for the firing but have been shown photographs of the S3 Guards
now In our custody and. No.3 on photograph 24, whose name I am informed
is STEPHAN KONRAD, appears to me* to resemble strongly one of the Guards
involved.
7.	We gave immediate orders to KRAMER that all shooting at internees
was to cease immediately, and.that any further case reported to us
would, result in one SS Guard being shot for every interee killed, I
also directed that the dead and wounded be removed for burial and
medical attention respectively, "t least one of the dead was carried
away on ray orders by JOSEF KRAMER, who showed, the utmost, reluctance to
comply with the order.
8.	Despite my orders single shots were to be heard around the
perimeter of the Gamp, some of which may have come from the Guard
towers, during the next 16 to 18 hours.
9.	I formed the strongest impression that such shooting at internees
was a popular sport among the Guards for no adequate reason since I am
convinced that no attempts to escape were made after the British
occupation commenced, A further repetition of orders to shoot one for
one was necessary before this could finally be stopped.
cont﻿51.

- 2 -
the, 16th -^prll 1945 it was reported to me that some of the
Hungarian soldiers employed as guards by the SS had broken into and
looted the food stores. It was further reported that food sent by
charitable organisations, principally Jewish, for the use of
internees, was custoraarily regarded as the perquisite of the guards.
I issued stringent orders to the Hungarians'in this regard and no
further such looting was reported.
11. In regard to the generally deplorable condition of the Gamp
and my report above referred to, it is my considered opinion that
such conditions were the result of gross negligence and criminal
lack of care on the part of the Gamp staff over a period certainly
not less than twelve weeks. In my opinion it is inconceivable
that the state oi aifairs existing on IStli Jipril 1945 could have
been attained in any less time.

GENERAL SURVEY OF BELShN CONGLNTRi-iTION CAMP.
— / ' '	' '...'
This Concentration Camp consists of two areas, one (Camp 1) a hutted
camp made up of 5 Main Compounds, divided by wire, and an enclosure
containing administrative huts, all enclosed, in a wired-in perimeter. In
addition to this a certain portion of the neighbouring barracks area had '
quite recently been taken over as Camp 2 for the reception of 16,000
male persons who had arrived from other camps. Owing to the better
accommodation and facilities, and their recent arrival, these prisoners
were in much better condition that those in Camp.1.
Camp 1, For plan of Camp, 1, see Appendix''B'.
Living accommodation . This Camp consists of 5 Compounds, 3 for men
and two for women.
The total number of prisoners was given to me on 16 2ipr 45 as
Viiomen	-	28,185
Men	-	12,000 (.approx).
The sizes of these Compounds varies considerably; In the case of the
men, containing from approx 1,500 to 8,000 and the two women’s enclosures
(No.l) 23,000 and (No.2) approx. 5,000. In the former was one enclosure
said, to hold approx 500 children. In both men's and women's compounds
conditions in the huts varied considerably, some being bunked with 2-3
tiered bunks,whilst in others the prisoners just lay crowded, together
on the floor. Except in men's compound No.3, there were certain huts
sot aside for use as hospital huts,but,except in one of the men's
compounds and. in the large women's enclosure, these were quite
inadequate. ihey were not even all bunked, as the following figures will
show.	-	'	o o
/
Women's Compounds. Number of prisoners acutely ill suffering from
. definite diseases exclusive of malnutrition was approx 2,000 and
for these there were only 474 bunks. In consequence each was occupied
by 2 or 3 women, the remainder, including practically all typhus
patients, just lying ohthe bare boards. In Compound. No.2 there was
one hut only set aside, as a hospital hut, and this was Without any beds.
In- this compound typhus patients were not segregated..
lien' s Compound , Hospital conditions in those compounds were not
as good as those in the Women's compounds, although there were
rather more bunks. 1959 for 2242 acutely ill. In compound. No .3 no
huts at all had been set aside.
Up to the time of their liberation it Is understood that all
personnel had been_ strictly confined to .their particular compound ■
and there was no mixing at all.'
- Cookhouses. There were 5 cookhouses within the precincts of Gamp
No.l. Two for men, two for women and. one mixed, cookhouse. Their
sizes varied, but in the majority of cases 2 to 3 cookings had to
be done for each meal.
The number of meals varied, from 2 to 3 per diem and
consisted only of a soup of vegetables, mainly carrots, dried
cabbage and potatoes, thickened, wit^t meal. Very occasionally small
amounts of fneat were added.
Water.	-‘•here were two or three small concrete ponds within
the camp #rom which prisoners could draw water, but as practically
all supplies, were dependent upon'electrical pumping there had been
no water at all for several days owing to the cables being cut.
Crematorium At the bottom end of the camp was a crematorium
consisting of one ouen which apparently had not been used for some﻿4
56
time as the number of deaths had been increasing'!. ' at too rapid a
rate. In the neighbourhood of this building judging by the earth
recently turned over had obviously been several graves of the mass
pit variety and this was confirmed by the Commandant. On the
South side of the Camp was a large pit approx 25 yds x 8 yds x 4 yds
in which were a considerable number of blackened corpses.
Prison Cells, One building was set aside, consisting of bare
prison cells .
Administrative a-rea outside the Main Prison Compounds. This
consisted of a main Office building'and living' huts around for
Guards and. administrative- personnel. In addition was a small build-
. ing with a few ablutioh benches and a larger containing 4 big
disinfestation chambers, each capable of doing 60 sets of clothing
in l| hours. In this latter building were 15 shower baths.
Latrines. These were practically non-existent and where there
were any consisted of a bare pole over a pit, without any screen-
ing whatsoever.
Gamp No .2 , This had only very recently bum formed (about a week) by
taking over a portion of the Barrack area. Accommodation here was
naturally very much better but all the buildings were grossly overcrowd-
ed and had of course got already in a filthy condition. However, the
majority of the inmates were in moderately good condition, and there was^
no record of any cases of Typhus. The prisoners were divided into
barrack blocks by nationalities which made supervision considerably
easier. One block had been set aside as a Hospital.
Barrack area. Adjoining these 2 Camps and a continuation
of Camp No.2. was a most magnificent barrack area with every possible
facility - good canteens, cookhouses, excellent garages and stabling,
a cinema, good married quarters and a beautiful Officers' Mess.
In this barrack block area were 8 hospital
blocks housing at the time they were seen G04 German Military-patients,
whilst in beautiful surroundings just beyond the officers' mess
was an excellently.appointed ’Military Hospital of 500 beds.
4* INVESTIGATIONS CARRIKD OUT.
15th April 45.
JOSEPH KRAMER(Commandant) was interviewed by Lt.Col Taylor,
DSO (Allied Military Commander) and myself and whilst this was being
carried out there was the sound of Intermittent small arms fire but
no indication that this was within the . camp area. However, a runner
arrived to say that there was rioting at the Central Cookhouse.
On arrival there everything seemed .quiet, but one 3S man stated
that there had been stealing of soup. There was no evidence of
this. Rifle fire continued to be heard, this time nearest hand,
and - on proceeding through the camp, SS Guards were found to -be
shooting prisoners who in their hungry condition were endeavouring
to remove potatoes from a pile near the cookhouse.
Commandant KRAMER made no attempt to stop his men and it
was only on a threat to shoot the SS personnel immediately, ona
basis of one for one, should any further killing take place that
the situation became quiet. Neither Commandant KRaMER nob any oi
his personel made any attempt to succour the^wounded and dying,
nor to remove the dead. An order was given to this effect and
the Commandant'himself made to assist.
There' was naturally considerable excitement amongst
the prisoners who were thronging the Central road outside their
Compounds. Their welcome was exuberant, but at that time
absolutely orderly, and although It was extremely difficult to
Induce them to return within their compounds, this was eventually
done.	.	... r,
A detachment was left within the camp to maintain order
and tanks positioned near the main food store. Instructions were
p-iven also to all enemy guards that unless there was an,y mass
attempt to escape' outside the perimeter of the camp all firing﻿- 5 -	gy
should be high.
. D^rinS the night there was intermittent disturbance and both
single shots and automatic weapons had to be-used by British
troops firing high to discourage looters. There were no
casuaities of any kind during the night and everything was orderly
at first light,	J
n addition to the Commandant I saw the Senior German SS Medical
Uilicer KLBIW who confessed complete ignorance of the position
stating that he had only been there a few days. I consider this an
evasion as although he may only have been in charge for a few days
1 was informed by many prisoners that he had been at the Camp for
several^months. He was the only SS Medical Officer in Camp.l.
him and also the Somor -Administrative tiedical Officer
(STABLER) for the area, I gave a questionnaire which was to be
completed by the following morning (16th). This questiomaire
covered the following points
1.	nominal roll of the Medical Staff, Male and Female
T^ith any special appointments held,
2.	Number of Hospitals.
3.	Bed state in each Hospital.
4.	Diseases by types and numbers in each.
5.	Medical stores available, to include vaccines.
6.	aood position, including special food for the seriously
ill.
7.	Dlsinfesters available, number and capacity.
8.	Bathing facilities,
9.	Laundry facilities.
10.	Disinfectants available.
11.	Protective clothing, if used, and the amounts available.
12.	Clothing for prisoners available,
13.	Laboratory facilities.
During the attempt to-peacefully persuade the inmates to return to
their compounds it was' abundantlyobvious that conditions were
appalling. Numerous dead bodies were seen which could not have
resulted, from the recent shooting, one inmate reported that the
nuts too contained large numbers of corpses sharina the accomm-
odation with the living.
. Ma^7 the inmates talked to were obviously well bred, and
intelligent, iheir condition was pitiable in the extreme and
although many stories of their hardships were told it in no ¥/ay
prepared one for the indescribable horrors seen on the following
- day.	&
k£vi},- At 0830 hrs a rapid tour of the whole area of both Camo 1
,	tamp 2^war arranged and during this a prepared statement was
broadcast in four languages to all prisoners, announcing that
’em an control of the Camp was at an end and had been taken over
by the British forces. The inmates were promised help of all kinds
and exhorted to remain quiet so that the efforts of the troops to
aid them could be facilitated.
The Commandant KRAMER, in a Jeep and guarded by CMP's, was
instructed to lead the way to the Crematorium and asked whether
there were any open graves. He without shame led the way to the
pit referred to above, which contained large numbers of blackened
corpses and on the way two large piles of naked corpses, all mere
skeletons were passed. Each pile must have contained well over a
100 bodies of meh who must have died within the last few days.
It was found that these inmates had only recently been moved to
BELSEN and to accommodate them certain of the barrack Blocks
had been taken over.	\	- ■﻿-6-	58,
On completion of this tour and following a conference, a more
detailed inspection of Gamp "No.l was commenced, a large proportion
of the ordinary living huts and all so called 'Hospital acemmodation was
inspected in detail.
Although conditions were touch the same in all compounds there were
certain general points arising in each.
Mens 1 Compounds,
No.l. Typhus was on the wane and reached its peak in March. It is
understood that it commenced early in February.
No.2. This was the largest men's compound, and contained approx
8,000. Typhus had commenced here at a!later date than in
Compound. 1 and had now reached its peak. There were 266
cases and new cases were still occurring, but the medical
members considered that the worst was over. It was in this
Compound that the story of cannibalism was reported to me
by one of the doctors.
There had. been none for the last 2 days but before that
there had been many cases .
No.3. There were many fewer inmates in' this compound and no hut
set asid.e as a hospital*
Conditions in many of the huts were indescribable, several
dead bodies could be seen, in some cases moved up to the
ends, in others left just as they lay. Only by entering
the huts could the cases of extreme emaciation be seen,
so many obviously past any help however skilled.
The gutters outside the huts contained living and dead. There
was no attempt at sanitation whatsoever, the men just
squatting anywhere.
Women ' s Compound s .
No.l. This was a very large compound containing approximately
23,000. Conditions here weremuch the same as in the men's
compounds except that in a greater proportion there had
been attempts to preserve order and. some semblance of
cleanliness. Theredicl seem however to. me more cases of
extreme emaciation amongst the women than the men and in
hut 208 conditions were appalling. Practically every inmate
was so weak that they could hardly raise themselves and
the passage was equally crowded with both living and deads
Not so many dead bodies were left for any length of time
In the huts or surroundings but in' the middle of the
compound and practically adjoining the children's area
was a vary large area of naked women piled high. It must
have contained many hundreds .
The hospital block in this compound was a paradise
compared to any others and I can't speak too highly of
the efforts of certain of the women doctors. One woman
Gynaecologist was conducting all the obstetric cases,
averaging 5 to 7 per day, and for some days without any
water supply available.
The care that had been taken of the children was- also
most noticeable.
In this compound.,however, the number of bunks available
for Hospital cases was grossly inadequate. 474 for a total
of approx 2,000 acutely ill. In many cases there were 3
In each bunk and the condition In the Typhus ward where
there were no bunks at all was indescribable. The same
applied to the men's compound, The typhus in this compound
was well segregated, and was definitely on the wane. There
were approx 250 cases here. Out of the 23,000 inmates of
the compound, medical personnel estimated that there were
not more than 5,000 well.﻿59
•t.
No,2,	In this compound tli©*1®"wore 4,500 women. Only one hut
WJ-S set aside as a Hospital and. this had no bunks in it.
.There was no segregation of typhus, of which there were
300 cases .
Medical Supplies . These were supplied from a central store in the
administrative block. The medical personnel said that
drugs and dressings were available but very frequently
not those most necessary. Dressings had been very short.'
No vaccines were available nor any form of anti-louse
powder for the control of typhus. No disinfectants were
available.
When the Medical Stores were inspected' certain Red
Gross boxes were found containing tinned milk,meats, etc.
It was explained, that these were part of a very large
stock sent by Jewish Societies for Jews. These had. been
stolen by the German Guards -and none issued., except
very occasionally a .small Issue of sweets to the
children.
Clothing;.
Food.
water.
Control.
Only in those who had obviously been in a short time
was clothing adequeate. Large number.s were in German
Hospital clothing. The fact that all corpses were placed
In piles nukes, was, I think,due to the fact that bodies
were stripped to see if any better articles of clothing
could be obtained.
The meals consisted entirely of soup made with meal
or flour and vegetables, mainly-carrots, dried cabbage,
potatoes, turnips j etc. with a very o ccaslonal and. scanty
sprinkling of small cubes of meat. The method of
distribution was by galvanised containers carried from
the kitchens to the various blocks by the prisoners
themselves. It is obvious therefore that no equality of
distributiophould even be organised, ahd the moment anyone
became too weak to fend for himself the chance of obtain-
ing any food became more and more remote.
There had.beeh none for days owing to the failure of
the electricity. It was pitiable to see both men and
women standing naked in their compounds endeavouring to
keep themselves clean from a teacupful of water.
In this camp there could, be no shame and no sex.
There were certain individuals, one per block, appointed
as block leaders. They were, I supposed, to keep order and organise
the general administration Including feeding arrangements for their
respective blocks. All signals were made by whistle.

By the afternoon of the first day (16th) 27 watbrcarts were
provided^by 8 Corps, and a supply of food in tins for the evening meal.
11 initial supplies had obviously to be carefully guarded and issue
supervised.
The psychological effect of this provision was amaxing, and each
day the atmosphere in the camp has improved, changing from one of
extreme apathy through the gradual appearance of a spark of vitality
to real joy and an interest in life. The magnitude of the Medical
problem in the supervision of special feeding' and supervision of
feeding for those cases of starvation cannot"be over-estimated. Steps
have already been taken to provide .a special gastric diet for these^
cases and an attempt to mobilise helpers to ensure that the weakest are
Ud, until such time as they can be moved to a new hospital area.
G-eneral Policy.
(a)	The complete evacuation of Camp 1 and I hope its destruction
by fire.
(b)	The ^ establishment of a transit area in the present
administrative building which includes the present bath-
house- and disinfestors . Through this will be passed, all
inmates who are well, and. they will be dusted with AL 63
plus bathing where possible.
('O Camp 2 will be evacuated, immediatoly of all fit oef sonne-1
who will be removed, either to D ,P, Camps or accommodation
in the Barrack area. There have been no cases of Typhus in this
O) the fit and well in Camp 1 will be bathed, dusted and. Issued
with new clothing where necessary and evacuated to the far
end of the Barrack area.
(U An nrea of the barrack blocks (8 of which contained German
Military wounded) has been evacuated, either to neighbouring
German Hospitals or in the case of the Hungarian Guard to
other accommodation:; this will be set aside as a hospital
area and all acutely ill removed immediately to this
location, passing through a reception area en route. The'
cases of malnutrition and starvation will also be passed
through a reception area where they can be carefully examined,
and passed to the appropriate destination. The German
Officers’ Mess has been taken over for - the reception of
the worst cases of starvation not suffering from communicable
infectious disease. These will be nursed by British
Nursing Officers.
Nursing in the main hospital area will be carried out tti-uer
the supervision of British male personnel by Prisoner
Medical Officers and- nurses assisted by Herman Nurses mobilised
for the purpose. Large numbers can be made available.
Special Measures.

Welfare facilities to Toe pift in train
including provision of Postal'facilities.
Papers to be •ready as soon as required..
Help from UNNRA teams if possible of
varied nationalities and Red Cross teams.
Visit of Members of Typhus Commission.
(c)	Large stores of captured German drugs and dressings
will be made available.
(d)	All forms of clothing and ordnance stores v^ere
demanded and where possible will be provided from
captured German stock. Large quantities are already
on^the way. Women's clothing will probably have to
be demanded from German civilian sources.
(e)	All food of a luxury nature and suitable for the
special feeding of these patients was impounded from
the local Hosp stores and: arrangements will be made
for resupply of eggs, milk and butter from the
surrounding districts.

1.	It is unnecessary to enlarge on the horrors of the
.Concentration Camp. Nothing like it has ever been seen by anyone who has
yet visited the Camp, and the photographs attached as nppx 'C1 fail to
reproduce the worst horrors which could only be appreciated by seeing
the inside of the worst huts.
2.	The Game No.1 will be evacuated completely, priority being
•riven to the acutely^ ill and the fit and well whose removal can^proceed
simultaneously. Next will leave those suffering iron malnutrition
with a reasonable expectation of survival, ana finally the whole
community. During this period, supervised feeding will take, place ox all
those in Camp 1 awaiting removal. It is considered that this will
rive the greatest chance and expectation of life to the greatest number.
3,	All protective measures are being taken and extra help_ _
demanded. Typhus inoculation will be carried out on all those requiring
it and the necessary period of quarantine imposed.
Should Bacteriological examination prove.the presence of
Typhoid to any extent inoculation by TAB will be considered if supplies
are available.
4.	The original■estimate of the number of cases of Typhus
1,500 was probably too ligh. The actual figure Is probably between
900 - 1,000.
This comprises a preliminary report on the^ conditions
existing at the time of liberation and is based on continuous
observation throughout the first 4 days . further report will be
rendered when more accurate statistics' should be available.

* I4y neca^ is *1S^K JSSSEW^ST and I am 21 years of age, I am a
Polish. Jew. I was takes to the Ghetto at Malistok is 19ijl and
remained there until 1942, when I was transferred to Lublin	,
Canc^atration Csas> I have also been in Blisyn, Plasov, Gross
Rosen snd Btsiierwald Gonoontration Camps* I eerived at Belsen
" in Fobruary 1945, and Z became a Caj>o in Block Ho. 2
You are charged with the followirig offences :»
(i)At Bclsen, about the middle of l&rch 1945, aairder by beating
a fellow internee inrbil he died*
(ii)Beating fellow internees at various dates at Belsen,
Bo you tmderstand the charges nc-de against you ?
Yes.
You need not say anything, but if you do want to make a statement
I sill write it down, get you to sign it, and it may be used in
evidence at your trial.
Bo you wish to make a atate;\ ent ?
Yes.
About the «gvn I have killed and the people I have beaten,
I would 1 i>c to know the nave of Hie verson «fecm I liave killed
as I do not know anything about having killed anyone.
I have beaten people, I agree, but only because it was rocessrry
to keep ihe block ckeaa when people refused to do it. For instance
I saw a prisoner coae in with dirty boots and lie m£ going to bed
in his boots. I asked him to take his boots off and I said ” i1he
block must be kept clean and you oast take off your boots'*. He
Refused to do this so I had to beat him.
Shea the ueqple mde t'ne block dirty by refusing to go to ihe
lavatory I ms wcken tse? to restore order in the Block, fh©
iirisoners themselves osked me to restore oru.er n3. I was afraid
sat® cS Blocklsaders would come and see it so I had to .vanish peop..<.a^
like that . On another occasion one of the prisoners stole
bread from another prisoner and X was asked to punish him because X
was responsible for order in fee block. I was always askedJy the
Blocldeader to keen ox-dex’ and I %ms responsible for such order
to fee Blockleader and to the dS guards.
X have never beaten people because I a® a sadist or because 1
liked*but because I had to do it.
’l would like you to help ;vc and to let ae free.
Woidd you like to call any witnesses in your defence ?
There were only Russian and Polish people in the block and they
are act her© now. X would like to call fee Block leader of Block
2 is ry defence, but X only 1mm that his name xs m&m. - that xs
his Christian name - and lie was a Blcvakitui, I cto xa>«. knew "*e

Ms name is ISAAK JBDiiLSWSiOf,
3,	At Belsen I livsd first in Block Bo.l and later, at the beginning of
April, in Block Ho,2 Whilst I was in Block Bo.l I was able to see what wes
happening in the courtyard of Block Bo, 2, as only a wire separated the two
adjoining courts. I have seen JHD, LSBKI practically evexy clay beating
prisoners with a wooden board or Ms belt and in many instances the prisoners
were sick and weak through hunger. ilany of these beatings occuEed on parades,
such as the distribution of food .
I remember one occasion , whilst we were standing on Appel, then I sav|
JBDSLS^KI getting the prisoners of the adjoining Block Bo.2 on Appel.
He was beating a prisoner with his belt, stJSdlng hi® across the face and body,
until eventually the laan fell to the ground screaming. He was then carried
by his ooizro-des to tlie first row of the asscehled parade, where he was put down
on the ground and remained sitting through the whole of the parade because he
was unable to stand up.
4.	When I was moved into Block Bo. 2 I did not attend the morning Appels,
However I often saw JHDAIW3KI beating the prisoners at the daily distribution
of food. On these occasions he would either use a stick or wooden board and
the beatings were so serious that many of those whom he beat were bleeding and
were unable to work.

Judge Advocate General.﻿2. FINDING:	NOT GUIDi'X.
3." EVIDENCE:	Affidavits of two witnesses - no witnesses present in person,
4.	EEA3GMS iGR ACQUITTAL:	Both affidavits lacked any identification of the accused, |
for although he was mentioned by name there was no indication that the man named was
the accused, apart from the identity of names. The Court, therefore, on a submission
of the defence, found that no case had been made out against the accused, and acquitted
him.
5.	POINTS ARIdlNG OUT OF THE TRIAL:
(a)	In the absence of witnesses in rierson, the finding- of the Court v/as inevitable
on account of the lack of proper identification of the accused. The deponents when
swearing the affidavits should have identified the accused by a photograph which could
have been attached to the affidavit, and the prosecution would then have had a case.
(b)	Even had the case gone further than it did a conviction would have been equally
remote, for the defence had six witnesses attending the Court in person, and no Court
would have been willing to convict on two affidavits 'which contained discrepancies
against six living witnesses who it appears were prepared to swear that they had been
with the accused on the day in question and had never seen him shoot at anything.
(c) The discrex^ancy in the affidavits consisted in the deponents stating in the
one case that the accused had used a rifle, in the other case that he had used a pistol
- a material discrepancy which made the case weak in itself apart from the lack of
identification.

Court of the above named War Criminal, a Hungarian Officer.
Ref your para 2 (a)
COMBOS appeared before the Summary Court at CELLE about 22nd Dec 45
when the charge was read over him and remanded until the 2nd Jan 46, so that
a whole day could be given to- the case. During the interval arrangements were
made through H.Q. 43 Div. Celle for the man to be defended. He chose a British
Officer, then Lt. Now Capt SIMS, 7 Hants Regt.
On the 2 Jan 46, before the court was about to sit it wag realised, that
. COMBOS, being a Hungarian Officer and not discharged, placed the Court in
difficulty as to the correct procedure to adopt at his trial. Nothing could
be found whereby a Mil Gov could try him for the offence. Ref was made to
Legal Branch, Hannover, 30 Corps and lat*r to Legal, Lttneburg.
Capt CLARE, ‘Legal Branch, Liineburg, saw the Case records and state-
ments. One feature which came to light was that no proof could be obtained
whether or not Ordiaance No. 1. had been posted in the Camp. Also,' that
it has been rejected as a War Crime. He gave the decision to drop the case.
43 Div. H.Qtrs were informed. There were 3 witnesses for Prosecution and 22
for Defence.
* #
COMBOS was held here for a further 14 days and then transferred to the
Hungarian Camp at Wolfsburg for safe custody. Instructions were given to hold.
The same day instructions were received from Lt Col Tilling that Signal had
been received stating COMBOS was required by Czecho-Slovakia as a War Criminal.
Immediate instructions were given to the Camp Commandant, Wolfsburg, to hold
pending escort and transfer to CELLE Prison.
COMBOS held in CELLE Prison until instructions are received from higher
authority as to procedure and final disposal.

follows:-
"Unauthorized use of a Firearm contrary
to Ordinance 1. , Art. 1 , Sec. 10.
For that he at Belsen on or about the 15 Apr 45
did fire a revolver at Allied Nationals."
2.	The evidence obtained is conflicting dates varying and
will be "Sworn Statements" as 5 of the 4 witnesses are repatriated
to Hungary.
3.	Our difficulty is that being an undischargedMember of
the Hungarian Anriy we know of NO directive under which we can
proceed. It is known Ord.I. was not posted.
4.	This case was being dealt with as a "War Crime" but
since the offence is alleged to have occured the "day" after the
occupation, the onus of trying the Case was placed on Mil Gov.
5.	Lt Col Tilling informed me personally this man was also
required by CZECHOSLOVAKIA. May we have a copy of the Signal
received to give us the power to hold.

VAJNA ran towards them shouting at the crowd, trying to disperse them and I saw
him beat some of these internees with a broom stick. He also shot into the
crowd with his pistol and I saw one of the internees fall to the ground. At
the time of the shooting and the beating, I was standing about 50 metres away

1.	' The above-named, at present held in custody in Civilian
Internment Camp at ESTERWEGEN, is believed to have been a c^g^ at
BELSEN Concentration Camp. According to the accused' 3 own statement,
copy of which is forwarded herewith, he was a Pole, son of a big
engine manufacturer in POSEN. In 1939 he joined the Polish Army
as a Flying-Officer and later flew to England with his squadron
where he states that they served as a separate Polish squadron in
1940. On 22 December 1941 he states that his plane was shot down
over Germany and he was made Prisoner of War, finishing up in
BERGEB-BEI£EN in 1944, where he was appointed a supervisor of the
Jewish section of the Camp.
2.	in a statement made to Dutch detectives on 12 Oct 45
he denied that he WaS^capo, but in the Deposition made at a Dutch
proces-verbaal	45 he admitted that he was a capo in the
Camp, though he became a capo only under duress.' It is requested
that this information and the enclosures are passed by you to the
Polish authorities in case they should wish to take action against
this accused as a traitor, in which case the accused could be
handed over to them. Otherwise, he will be tried as a Concentration
Camp guard on the evidence enclosed herewith.

The above named, at present lield In custody in Civilian Internment
Gamp at BSTSRWSGHN, is believed to have been a capo at iSSLSBN Concentration
Camp, According to the accused's own statement, a copy of rhich. is forwarded
herewith, he was a Pole, son of a big engine manufacturer in POSKN, In 1939
he joined the Polish Ajrey as a Plying Officer and later flew to ENGLAND
with his squadron where he states that they served as a separate Polish
Squadron in 1940. On 22 December 1941 he states that his plan© was shot
down over GEBfiANY and he was made Prisoner of War, finishing up in
JBENGEN-BELdEN in 1944* where he was appointed a supervisor of the Jewish
section of the Camp.
2.	In a statement made to Dutch detectives on 12 Oct 45, lie denied
that he was a capo, but in the Deposition mde at a Dutch prooes-verbal
in Aug 45, he admitted that he -was a capo in the Camp, though he became
a capo only under duress.
3.	The accused's statements concerning his service with the EAF have
been checked with the Air Ministry. We forwarded them the number of the
Squadron the accused was supposed to have served with, the type of aircraft
he allegedly flew and other relevant particulars.
4.	Prom the Air Ministry's reply, we gather that the accused's statement
of service with the RAF is a complete fabrication.
5.	It is thought that you may desire to try the above mentioned as a
Traitor and accordingly all documents held in respect of him ore enclosed
herewith*
6. Please let us have your views in due course.

With reference to your BACK/37711/338/A(PS4) of 1? Jan
I946 1 wish to give ny viewr on the above mentioned case.
1.	in view of the information obtained, by your Branch from
the Air Ministry I am convinced that, the statement made by Kaziraierz
rTBiaTTrrflKT is completly fabricaefced. Nevertheless 1 have written to the
Polish General Staff in London in order to obtain information whether
E.GSGIELSKI served in the Polish Airforce.
2.	According to the evidence given by Kazimierz OEGIELSKI
and the witness Joseph WEISST there were 2 T-i' Kazimier%) in the camp
of STERKAMP. There is no certainty whether the witness*s evidence
relates to K.CEGIBLSKI or to other Capo. Since the witnesses say that
they can recognise hint, it would be advisable to arrange a confronta-
tion, or if impossible to produce to the witnesses his photographs in
order to establish the identity of the accused.
3.
4«
With reference to par. 5 of your letter, I with to point]
out that in my opinion Kazimierz GEGIELSKE can not be considered a
traitor, but if the accusations against him will be proved he must be
considered » war criminal. Here I may refer to the Belsen Trial, where]
some of the Polish Capos were tried as war criminals, together with
KRAMER and other SS.
I shall communicate with you as soon as 1 receive an
answer from the Polish GHQ in London. In my opinion the suspect should]
remain in the meanwhile in custody. It would be much appreciated if
you arranged for establishing GEGIELSKI's identity as pointed out
under par. 2.

Dutoh-English,
Stateless, born 4"bh March, 1926 ih Vienna, Not; living in AMSTERDAM, Hotel
Stadt Elberfeld, states:-
1.	I left Eienna in 1939 for Holland and was arrested during
the time of the occupation and imprisoned in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and
Westerbork because I am a Jew. On the 12th January, 1944> I was sent to
the Concentration Camp at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, and placed in the so
called STERKAMP (Jewish Camp). The Camp was occupied by 2,000 Jews and
five Capos,
2.	One of the Capos was known under the name of KAZJMIERZ. This
man maltreated his fellow prisoners in the most dreadful manner, I have
seen him beat a certain Dutch Jew, named RODRIGUES, with a stick in the
presence of several other Capos whilst Rodrigues y;as lying in bed. On
another occasion I saw Kazimierz beating Rodrigues. Rodrigues had to lie
over a chair and was then beaten, with a stick, on the back. Rodrigues died
approximately two days later from the effects of his beating.
3.	I have also seen another ten people being beaten and kicked
in the most brutal and barbaric manner by Kazimierz as well as 18 fellow
prisoners who were hung by Kazimierz for cannibalism. I believe the exe-
cution took place by order of Untorscharfuhrer MULLER and Rottenfuhrer Y/ERNICKE.
It concerned several prisoners who, driven by hunger, entered the morgue and
cut open the deed bodies removing the liver and eating it but they were caught
whilst doing so. I myself have never been beaten by Kazimierz.
4.	In the camp Kazimierz had an affair with Henny De Haas, whom
I believe to have associated with the SS men as well. It is a fact that
Henny De Haas, witnessed several beatings committed by Kazimierz,
5.	Kazimierz had, like all the other Capos, plenty of food and
cigarettes and was very friendly with the S3 guards.
6.	I look upon Kazimierz as a bad War Criminal. I shall
recognise him when I see him.
7.	None of the Capos in our Camp, including Kazimierz, were
forced to maltreat their fellow prisoners, but they did it only because it
gave them satisfaction.
After having the statement read to him SCHLACHIT signs the statement as a
true statement.

Dutch-English.
Stateless, born on 27th July, 1925 in Frankfurt a/m. Germany, now living
at SCHINKELSTRAAT 15, AMSTERDAM. States
1.	During the occupation of Holland X was taken, via the camps
of VTJGIH and 1ESTERB0RK, to the Concentration Camp of -Bergen-Belsen, Germany,
where I remained from 11th January, 1944, until 9th April, 1945. I was
living in the so called STERILMP.
2.	In our Camp were' a lot of Capos, but I knovJ1 for certain of 5
Capos who are responsible for maltreating prisoners. Some did it by order
but others did it out of sheer sadism. To the last category belongs the
Capo Kazimierz, a Pole, who’s surname is unknown to me.
3.	I witnessed several times beatings given by Kazimierz to a aon
named RODRIGUES who was ill in bed. Kazimierz beat Rodrigues with a stick
with the result that the victim died a few days afterwards. I also witnessed
Kazimierz beating a group of females with his sstick. The women ptood close
together by the so called Bread Kommando. I mystelf received a hit by
Kazimierz with his hand.
4.	Kazimierz was known as a Capo who was very friendly with the
SS guards and was called by them with the title "Unser Freund Kazimierz"
(Our friend Kazimierz).
5.	I look upon Kazimierz as a typical War Criminal. I shall
recognise Kazimierz when I see him.

1	Via the Camp of TvEST.ilEBORK I was taken to the
Concentration Camp at Bergen-Belsen on the 1st February, 1944 and was
there employed as Camp Doctor.
2,	In January, 1945 five Capos arrived, amongst them a
Capo named KAZBIIERZ, Kazimierz committed the most brutal crimes on
his fellow prisoners.
3.	Two Hungarians came to me for treatment one day;, one
vra.s walking and the other had to be carried. After examining (.he
Hungarian who had been carried in I saw that he had received a sey'®rG
beating with the result that he suffered from a base fracture of the
skull and he died soon afterwards.
i aid not see who had beaten this prisoner but I am
certain that it vifas Kazimierz because no one used to maltreat the
prisoners as brutally as he did.
5.	Whilst changing barracks on the 7th February, 1945
I saw Kazimierz beat a prisoner who had hidden in a bed with another •.
prisoner. He beat him until he fell to the ground and Kazimierz continued
to beat him until the prisoner got up and limped away.
6.	I have also seen Kazimierz beating people in the
Waiting Room for the sick. These people have come to the Camp Doctor
for treatment (one had to be in a very bad condition in order to get
permission to visit the doctor) and 'Kazimierz beat and chased all the
sick out of the vralting room with a piece of timber. I think Kazimierz
is a typical sadist and to be looked upon as one of the worst War Criminals
I shall recognise him aga.in when I see him.

called STERKAMP.
2.	For the last six months I knev a. Kapo by the name of Kazimierz
CEGIELSKI, Oegielski was responsible for the gross maltreatment of his
fellow prisoners. I have seen him beat his fellow prisoners with a stick
that he could hardly hold .YJith both hands.
3.	He hit his victims with full force so that they lost
conciousness and suffered great pains. He also icicioed and beat his
fellow prisoners in a way that endangered their lives. He maltreated his
victims regardless of age or illness. He used to strip the dead of all
their belongings and on account of this was a rich man in the Camp, and
whilst his fellow prisoners were dressed in old rags, he himself was always
well dressed.
4.	He maltreated us out of sheer sadism and is therefore to be
looked at as a War Criminal.
cj.	I have been beaten by him until he drew blood and until
I was screaming with pain. I shall recognise Ccgielski when I see him.

Dutch nationality, born on the 29th May 1907 in Amsterdam, and now
living at 30 Diezestraat, Amsterdam. Ocoupation, Commeroial Traveller.
1.	On the 20th June 19A3 I was arrested by the Grune Polizei (Green
Polioe) in Amsterdam because I am a Jew. After being interned for a
time in Westerbork Camp, Holland, I was transferred to the Bergen-BGlsen
Concentration Camp, Germany, where I arrived on the 16th of February 1944-.
In Belsen I lived in the Sterkamp which was a camp especially for Jews,
2.	In January 1945 the so-called Capo system was formed and
in our Camp we had five Capos amongst them a Capo who we knew only by the
name of Kazimierz. This man made himself very unpopular during the time
I was at the Camp for the terrible way in which he treated his fellow
prisoners. '
3.	I have seen prisoners being beaten and kicked out of their
beds at 0500 hrs. Prisoners who; had permission from the Doctor or even
the Stabsarzt (Staff Doctor officers rank) to stay in bed were beaten with
sticks and so driven to the appell place. The certificate was then
destroyed by Kazimierz. The same applies to the treatment of women and
children,
4.	One day I was present when a prisoner named VIGEVENO was beaten
by Kazimierz, with a stick, so severely that the stick broke into pieces.
The reason, for the beating was that Vigeveno was in^possession of a doctors
certificate which allowed him to stay in bed.	Kazimierz drove the man
out of bed and then destroyed the certificate. Vigeveno died, tyro days
afterwards, as a result of this beating.
5.	I also witnessed the maltreating of Leo Franker., a dentist, .
who, although ill in bed with dysentry, was driven out of bed by Kazimierz
and sent to the Stuben Kommando (Room Commando). The Stuben ICommando
consisted of prisoners who had to work in the nearby bush removing roots
and tree-trunks which was very hard work and most of the prisoners were
not in a fit state to do this work. The prisoners were guarded by several
S3 men and bloodhounds and were maltreated in such a way that as a rule
not one of the prisoners managed to outlive this Stuben Kommando which
became known to hs as the "Commando of Death". Franken died a few days
after being sent to this Commando,
6.	In the camp Kazimierz had an affair with Henny de Haas _and.the
girl and her mother received, therefore, extra rations and privileges,
7.	All the above mentioned prisoners were maltreated by Kazimierz
not by order of anyone, but one of pure sadism,
8.	Kazimierz is, in my estimation, one of the worst War Criminals
and I would recognise him if ever I see him again.

On many occasions I saw the big Kazimierz beat his fellow prisoners
to such an extent that some of the victims fell to the ground unconcious
and some of them were wounded and bleeding. Shortly after the capos
had arrived in our camp I had asked 'them to stop beating the
prisoners and all consented but the two Kazimierz's. They didn't take

did they become a. little calmer. I shall recognise both Kazimierzs'

I remained in this Camp until the 1st April, 1942, when
with 230 prisoners of war we were sent out as a Commando to do farm work.
We all went to a small Camp near BERLIN. Whilst at this Camp I refsued to
sign a paper saying that I was a civilian and I got into trouble with the

LINGEN.
I remained there until August, 1942, when I was -spnt to

ind
Polish nationality, horn on the 28th July, 1915 in Warsaw. Profession,
Pilot officer. Lived at Radrymiska 109/14, Warsaw, Poland, at present in
No, 2 Prison, Amsterdam. States
1.	Before the war I was a pilot officer in the Polish Air Force
and on the outbreak of war went to England with the Air Force. In England
I was a fighter pilot in the 2nd Polish Air Squadron,
2.	On the 7th December 1941 I was shot down between Berlin and
Stettin whilst taking part in an air attacK on Stettin and saved my life
by jumping out of the plane with my parachute.• When the Germans arrested
me I was dressed in civilian clothing and had managed to destroy my papers
and therefore I was able to toll them that I was an ordinary soldier. I
was then taken to a P,0.¥. camp at LUKENWALDE, Germany where I remained
until 15th November 1941 when I was transferred to a P.O.W. Camp at BADHORS.
The beginning of March 1942 I was put into a ARBEITSElNSATZ (Working Party)
and was sent to a Camp in SCHOENEMARKT whore altogehter 250 Poles were
imprisoned. , One day a German officer told us that we had to sign a form
to the effect that we went into the ARBEITSEINSATZ voluntarily and were
not forced to do so. We all refused to sign the forms and I was arrested
by the Gestapo as1 I was supposed to have inspired the other prisoners not
to sign the form.
3.	The Gestapo took me to Bentheim and there I was severely mal-
treated. I had several teeth knocked out and I still have the marks of
the beatings on my body. I was then sent to various Gestapo camps such
as MUNSTER,” OSNABRUCK, LINGER and finally finished up in the Buchenwald
Concentration Camp. I stayed in Buchenwald from July 1942 until December
1942 and was then transferred to the Dachau Concentration Camp where I
remained until January 1943. I was then sent back to Buchenwalo but
three weeks later was transferred to Dora Concentration Camp,. On the
25th March 1944 I "Was transferred to Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp,
4.	In Belsen Camp I was employed in the administration until
January 1945, when I was forced by the Camp Commgndant Josef Kramer to
become a CAPO in the Jewish Camp Known as the "STERKAMP".	I refused to
become a CAPO but was told.by Kramer that I had 24 hours to think it over ^
otherwise I would be shot. I then consented to become a CAPO in the STERKAMP
■ 5.	I deny that I have ever beaten any person in the camp with' a
stick, but I admit having hit my fellow prisoners with my bare hands when
someone got caught stealing, I had to do this because I was forced by the
S.S. guards at 'SSRGEN-BELSEN.
6,	In the STERKAMP I got aquainted with BENNY DE DAAS and after a
while Yi/e made plans to get married. On the 7th of Apfil 1945« BENNY Db Iw-iAS.
was being taken to Trobitz as the Sterkarnp was being evacuated. Very soon
afterwards she was liberated by the British and was then sent back to
Holland,
7,	On the 15th April 1945 the British liberated Belsen and I
stayed at Bolsen until I was sent to a Polish P, 0. V/. Camp at Osnabruck,
about three weeks after the liberation. In the camp I asked for, and
was granted a permit allowing me to proceed to Holland for the purpose
of getting mo.rried, and I went to the address given to me by Henny De
Haas when she left the camp.
8,	I have nothing further to say.
9,	We heave closed this interrogation in accordance with the oath
given by us on the 26th January 1945.

Camp Staff, in violation of tlie raws and usages of war, was
concerned in the illtreatuent and killing of Allied Nationals

VERDICT:
SEt3TRNCE:_ Death by hanging
13 - 18 Jun 1946,
DATE CF TRI..L:
ii/DJ. G 1ms briefly outlined the facts of this case in his minute
1
of advice (Flag "A") and advises that the proceedings are legally
in order for confirmation. He further advises that accused’s
petition against finding and sentence (Flag "B") discloses no
adequate grounds for interfering with the conviction.
.. .ecused alleges that he served with the R. a. F., was shot down over
Germany, was made a FW but was sent to a concentration camp after
falling foul of tie Gestapo.'
.-mother curious feature of tiiis case is that accused, although a
Kapo alleged to have illtreated inmates of the camp, yet carried
on an affair with a Dutch Jewess inmate and followed her to HOLLuID
with a view to marrying her after the camp had been liberated.
The story of his service with the R, A.F. lias been checked with the
Air Ministry and found to be false in every detail.
giiaaRVATIQlS:
The allegations that accused frequently and savagely beat inmates
are substantiated by tiic evidence both oral and in affidavit form,
and accused* s contention that he reserved his beatings mainly 1 or
black market operators in the camp has little bearing.
The evidence that accused was directly responsible for deaths is
not so strong but there is no doubt that some of the victims of
his beatings did die shortly afterwards and it is reasonable to
consider that, knowing the feeble health of Ms victims, he uust
have been fully aware that Ms beatings might well prove fatal.
caused raised the defence of mistaken identity, asserting that he,
known in the camp as " big Kasimiers" was being confused with another
Kapo, "little Kasimiers". But the well known attachment between "big
Kasimiers" and the Dutch Jewess referred to above and Ms admission
that it was he who proposed to marry that girl is conclusive proof
tltat tiie evidence before the court referred to himself and not to
Ms namesake.﻿9.
Ext 2809
In these cireuiastances, I recomend that you confirm the finding
and sentence. If you agree, will you please write the word
"eonfirniod''over your initials in coin (h) of page 2 of hP ii4
(Flag "C")t complete page 3 of AF A/i- (Flag "D") where marked and
sign the Death Warrant (Flag "E").
It will he necessary for you to send this case to the Commander
in Ciiief for Ills concurrence.

1*	I am directed by the Judge Advocate General of the Forces
to return this case which was referred here by the D.J.A.G. at your
Headquarters. As no British nationals are concerned the case has not
been registered with the United Nations War Crimes Commission.
2.	The Judge Advocate General has instructed me to convey the
following advice to you regarding the case.
3.	In my opinion the evidence justifies the trial by Military
Court under the Royal Warrant of the above named on ,the following charge;
Charge
COMMITTING A WAR CRIME
in that he
at Belsen Germany on or about 13 April 1945 in violation of the laws
and usages of war did shoot at a nurriber of unarmed civilian internees
Allied nationals.
4.	The accused should be attached to a Unit and the Commanding
Officer should sign the charge sheet as such in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph 4 of the Regulations for the Trial of War
Criminals as set out in Army Order 81 of 1945.	In the heading of
the charge sheet the accused should be described as "Cadet Officer
Vajna of the Hungarian Army in charge of........(Unit) pursuant to
regulation 4 °f the Regulations for the trial of War Criminals".
5-	The following witness’ should be called at the trial to give
evidence in accordance with his Affidavit;
Racz Karoly who should omit the evidence given by him
in paragraph 3 thereof.
If this witness is not available the prosecution may put in
his affidavit as evidence.
6.	The Judge Advocate General further directs me to say that
he does not consider this a case in which he should depute a Judge
Advocate nor does he consider that a Judge Advocate is necessary.
In these circumstances one of the membersof the Court should have legal
qualifications in accordance with rule of procedure 93(b).	You
will doubtless make application to D.J.A.G. at your Headquarters for
the appointment of such an officer.	Similarly it is considered
that the prosecution should be conducted by an officer with legal
qualifications and application should be made to the D.J.A.G.' for
the appointment of such an officer.
7*	You will doubtless arrange for the accused to have the
services of a British officer at his trial. I think that he shoiM’^

8.	One copy of the charge sheet and the abstract of evidence will
be required for the use of the prosecutor.
9.	I enclose two copies of the Affidavit of Racz Karoly both of
which appear to be signed by the deponent.
10.	An impartial person competent to act as interpreter should be
available at the trial.

was not available, the prosecution might put in hi:

2. There is, however, another affidavit in the file, of
one 1VAITIGS. a copy of which is enclosed for your information
mi V and I would advise putting that affidavit in as well.
-
Y/ith regard to the Belsen cases- the position reached is
' that it will shortly be'necessary to set up a separate court at. .
Belsen and deal with a number of charges' which will be preferred
against a very considerable number of persons at Belsen' still
in custody, and you might consider that the cSharge against
Cadet officer ViJNA might be dealt with by this tribunal.
IV
do not know what' you have in mind -for what is generally
known as the "Second Belsen Trial", but on the information
at'present available and in ray possession,' ! was proposing
to invite you. to consider the setting .up of a court to sit at *
luiiiGiii-DliEraBIi and to try all these cases individually. There
may.bo as many as 40 or even more by the time the investigations^
are completed, and it is thought that this method of trial would
produce swift results and avoid the criticisms levelled at the
Belsen Trial.

1	It is considered that it would he undesirable to hold
at BEMtSN BELSM itself the trial, of BNI^iSN staff stxll
custody. The presence of large numbers of DFs xn the iamediate
neighbourhood is a potential threat to good order xn the went
of any of these trials ending in acyilttai, or sentences wliioh
are considered too light by EQ? public opinion,	\J
2.	flxig Branch will therefore reooir^nd to 30 Corps District
that these trials sho Id be held at OdLLlS.
3.	If these oases are all dealt with individually there vd.ll
be inevitable delay in tueir completion. It is considered tnat.-
(a)
Cases should caily be tried individually when sin
individual is charged with a specific crxtae NOx
in oonjimotion with another accused.
-u
(b) vAier: peraons are concerned in the same ariiae tney
should be tried jointly in groups of five or

4.	It la requested that you will bear this in nand when

Ref your BilOR/377lV35?/A(i-S.4) dated 21 Nov 45.
1.	The contents of para.l are noted.
2.	with regard to para.3, I have put your views forward to London, where
the method of preparation is under discussion at the moment.
3.	I am anxious to avoid having to prove the difficult element of concert.
There are two methods of approach to this sort of crime. One oi them is
to charge the crime as a concerting together to do something to a number of
individuals and the other is to charge the specific crime of the doing of that
thing to an individual or individuals.
4.	Bearing in mind the experience gained by the HBISEN trial, and having
had the advantage of reading many of the affidavits in the second Belsen case,
I am emphatically of the opinion that the latter method, which involves nearly
always individual trials, will be the most productive of satisfactory results.
5.	However, in this matter, the Judge Advocate General advises the C-in-C,
and in considering the material which will shortly be submitted to him, he will
be in possession of your point of view.

The above named is at present in custody in
PINEWOODS Jail, BELSEN, having been picked up from H4STERDAM
upon information supplied to us by you.
The enclosed depositions in Dutch were collected
at the same time as CEGIELSKI, translations of which have been
made by this Team, and two copies of each numbered 409 to 424
inclusive are also enclosed.
It is believed that you already hold depositions
•with regard to a man known as "Big KAZBilERZ". These depositions
numbered:
19A, 25A, 28A, 29A, 31A, 34A and 328
are among those taken by Captain SHERIDAN and would seem to refer
to the above named. It Is, however, pointed out that as those
depositions contained no reference to any formal identification having
been carried out, and as a slight doubt exists as to whether CEGLIELS
is indeed "Big KAZBIIERZ", it is suggested that Captain SHERIDAN’S
depositions are useless for any trial.
/
It is hoped, however, that the enclosed depositions
are sufficient to allow a charge to be brought.

Reference your BAOR/15228/2/C.17V9 dated 16 Nov 45 enclosing
docunitmts in respect of the above.
1.	The documents in this case from the Dutch sources were dealt with
as follows by this Team:-
(a)	All depositions from individual witnesses were first translated,
each one as a separate document.
(b)	The covering- statements made by the two Dutch Interrogating
Officers, P. C. TRENDS and C. VAN KL.EEF which appear both before
the witnesses1 statements and at the end thereSf in the Dutch
originals were then translated and appear as No. 409 of our
translation.
2.	We are enclosing four further originals and two copies of translations
thereof which should have been forwarded last time.
3.	With regard to para 2 of your letter, depositions No. 19a, 25a, 28a,
29a, 31a, and 34a, are all depositions taken by Captain H, G. Sherrin who
operated here before this Team arrived. Copies of these depositions were sent
to your office seme time ago although it is probable that you do not know them under
these numbers* This Team only possesses one copy of the above mentioned depositions
and it would he appreciated if you could locate your copies to prevent the
necessity of our retyping from the ones we have. I give below the names of the
witnesses together with the numbers allocated to them by this Team:-
18a - Ives CASTET
25a - Estevan TERUEL
28a - Georges Hourdiau
29a-Josef Henri MULIN
31a-Georges RENAUD
34a- Gilbert BIARDEAU
It is pointed out that all the attached depositions Numbered 409 to
not contain any identification tie up neither are they apparently made on
With regard to identification four photographs are enclosed marked CK 1 to
md it is suggested that the easiest way to put the identification question
Is to send these to the Dutch authorities with a request that they he shown to
,f the witnesses for identification and that sworn depositions should he taken
be officer concerned showing that the witnesses were shown photographs and
; Died OEGIELSKI correctly. The photograph of CEGIELSKE is marked CK 1.
With regard to deposition No.328 this was sent to you under '$2^/12
29 Aug 45, the letter being headed CZUBIASKI - Little Kasimer, and
3m by the undersigned with regard to a person who ms ■ at one time suspected
ag’Kasimer’* This deposition merely states that this person was released
ing been proved that in fact he was hot one of the Kasimers wanted by this

He informs us that all these witnesses Jive in

for your corBideration and advice to the C-in-G.
2.	The s/r> Accused ??as a Cano in BELSEft C oncentrr.tion Car® and
worked in the part known as the Sterisesp, or Jewish Camp.
3.	He appeu-rs on the evidence to have crossly maltreated Allied
nationals in the Canto, in particular, a Dutch Jew named RODRIGUES, in which
case the heating was sufficiently severe to cause the death • f the victim-.
4.	Among the depositions enoTosed there is one by a .Dutch national
Hendrina de HAAS, nho sneaks well of the Accused, but as he v's engaged to
her I do not think that she will be a very profitable witness for the Accused.
The affair between the Accused and the woran de HAAS seers to have been well
known by the other witnesses.
5,	The cose go nst the Accused tauld a-nrear on the evidence to be
complete,
6,	The Accused hos made	a Statement dated 29	Nov 45, which is
enclosed,	in	which he admits that	he was Supervisor at	the Camp	but states
that the evidence against him is malicious.
7.	In av interrogation of the Accused conducted by two Dutch
officials dated 7 Nov 45 the Accused, in para 5, admits hitting prisoners,
with his bare hands, whom he caught stealing, but states that he was forced
to do this by the SS Guards. This interrogation is not signed by the licensed.
8.	In a further interrogation of the Accused at AMSTERDAM, by Dutch
Police Officials, dated 19 Oct 45 the Aceusedadmits that he ms the Supervisor
of the Jewish sector of the BERGEN/BKLSBN Cans? but denies he wee a Capo.
9,	On the balance of the evidence there dyes not seem to be any
doubt that the Accused has a case to answer.
10.	It may be as well to	point out that there	were two	Capos in
BELSEN known	as KASIMIERZ and this pro ent Accused was	known by	the prisoners
as the "Great Kasim!erz" and had a certain notoriety.

in England from Sep 1939 till Dec 1941. On 7 Dec 41 he was shot down
during an air-raid on Germany. Until Apr 1942 he went to Stalag Ilia in

his comrades to do the same. The Gestano heard about this and sent him
to Sefangnis LI1IGEN on 1 Apr 42. On 1 Aug 42 he was transferred to
BUCHENWALD, and on 1 Jan 43 to DACHAU. He returned to BIEHENWALD on
1 Mar 43 and after three weeks went to camp DORA. On 25 Mar 44 he went
to BELSEN where he was given a job and worked on the post office for the
internees. Prom Jan 45 he belonged to the Ordnungsoolizei and
supervised the distribution of meals and helped in the maintenance of
discipline.
The a/n was arrested on. 29 Oct 45 by No. 1 War Crimes
Investigation Team as a War Criminal (Cano).
The case is drawn to your attention in case you are interested
from the renegade point of view. It is understood that the man is anxious
to have his case dealt with.

VERKLARING .
Hiermede wordt vericlaard, dat Kazimierz
GEGIELSKI,geboren 28 Juli 1915 in Warszawa (Polen)
zoon van Antoni en Konstancja geb. PotocJia,een Pools cb.
paspoort heeft aangevraagd.
Door de huidige tijdsomsfcandigiieden is net nog
niet mogelijk zi.jn aangelegenheid in behandelirg te nemen.
Zoodra bet mogelijk is,zal bij daarvab in kermis
gesteld worden.
Deze vernlaring wordt afgegeven ter overleggirg
aan de Nederlandsche autoriteiten.﻿1.	-I acted as prosecutor in the trial of Casiir ^KJIELSiJL at LlMiBURG-.
The trial lasted from 13'Jun 46 until 18 Jun 46. The accused was found guilty
and sentenced to death by hanging.
2.	I would like to add the following.remarks with regard to the diffi-
culties of procuring the attendance of tfie witnesses
(a) When I arrived on 12 Jun 46, the day before the trial, only
three witnesses out of the 13 for the prosecution had arrived
and none for the defence. The reason for that is stated by *A'
Branch to be that the arrangements for the trial had been the
responsibility of the Brigade of Guards who had done nothing
about it until the Friday before the trial was due to begin when
they sent one offiper by cat' to MSTERBAM where all the witnesses
(prosecution and*defence) lived. He had returned with the three
witnesses, saying that he could not trace the others. I insisted
upon this officer being brought before a Court, svhen he eventually
arrived, he was as insolfint as he was smart, and his smartness was
up to the usual high standard of guards. He stated that he arrived
in AMSTERDAM^ on Wit-Sunday and had only >.it-Sunday and Ilit-Monday
(V-Day) to find the witnesses, and received no co-operation from
the Dutch Police. It is to be pointed out in this cpnnection that
the Dutch Police is always very efficient and extremely helpful
unless they are approached on Vit-Sunday when obviously only a duty
officer is at the Headquarters.
(b)	After wasting the whole morning trying to find out why the
witnesses had not appeared, ana trying to pttrsuade the court to go
on with the trial, the trial started midday on Thursday with the
examination of the three prosecution witnesses. On Friday, 14 Jun,
three more witnesses for the prosecution arrived. They v/ere brought
by a British Officer who acted as Liaison Officer with the Du^ch Army,
lie had been waiting at the station for 4p hours without orders where
to report to because the Batallion of Life Guards had failed to send
a car to the station.	1
(c)	After discussion with the six prosecution witnesses-flow present,
I was able to ascertain the whereabouts of the other prosecution
■witnesses tmx and the witnesses for the defence. I made no further
effort to get more witnesses for the prosecution, as I considered
the prosecutions case well established, but it became obvious that the
case could not be brought to a successful end without tracing at least
some of the defence witnesses. I pursuaded the court to send one of
the two Polish Officers to AMSTERDAM'over the week-end and made it clear
that I would accept, without objecting to it, any statements which he
wanted to take from those defence witnesses who were unwilling or unable
to come. As all efforts to get this officer a car failed, he had to
* proceed by rail. He succeeded in finding the three defence witnesses
he required, and taking sworn statements from them on Sunday and returned
on Monday night, v/hich enabled the court to conclude the trial on Tuesday.
•
3.	I would like to add that it is my view that there was no lack og co-
operation from ’A1 Branch 30 Corps who seemed to try their best, but also seemed ±is
utterly unable to see that the orders they gave to -fee lower foimations are obeyed.

1.	in a dinute under abcve-aeationsd reference the five ab^ve-naaed
wore handed to you for trial on Id Ear 46: the reason why the JAS
did not advise trial ox the above-nentionvd subjects by a ...iiJtary
Court was that a military -ourt can only try crimes against Allied
nationals and in the .use of tue above-mentioned subjects the
identity sue. nationality of the victims was not established.
2.	This Group was warned by the Review and intelligence Gtaff of
So.6 "I j that one of the above-naiued subjects, Josef cA.4EH, was to
be released within a fortnight unless any objection was raised by us.
I notified the review and intelligence ataff of Mo.6 JIw tnat there
was every objection to xJLs release whi h is now being stayed. ^ ut
would a jpear tuat HAuuR has never been tried and this Group would tc
very grateful if we could ;.,e informed whether this applies to the
other four above“mentioned subjects and also what tne views of your
Bronch are on this matter as it seemed to have been agreed at the
time jf writing of the minute of 6 Ear 46 that .ases in which the
nationality of the victims could not be established would be tried
by Military Government courts under Law 10.

Subject:	Grimes against Humanity -
Trial of ex~Goncentration Gamp Guards
Reference your letter WOG/15228/11/9/3/Legal dated 16 Sept 1947*
1. Tbe delay in this matter is very much regretted, you vd.ll note
that until very recently all letters in this matter have been addressed
by you to War Grimes and Atrocities Section, Legal Division, and the
papers in connection with this and many other cases involving trial of
persons for Grimes against Humanity, involving persons of aifcher German
or stateless origin, have been forwarded by them direct to Regional
Authorities concerned, for trial by German Courts, The trialsfcy the
German Courts have been held up, firstly by the necessity of the completion
of speciman trials before Control Commission Courts, secondly by the rather
cumbersome procedure for location of accused held in internment, and their
interrogation and transfer to the German authorities, and thirdly by the
fact that the Ministry of Justice Branch, Legal Division, which is
responsible for the trial of Grimes against Humanity by German Courts, had
never been informed until very recently that these cases had been passed
to the Regions for trial, and therefore no supervision or encouragement
to expedite them has been afforded.
3,	immediate action is being taken to ensure not only in this case, but
in all other cases which have been passed from your Group to War Crimes and
Atrocities Section, and by them to the Regions concerned, that the accused
are located and transferred to the German authorities at the earliest possible
moment and every effort will be made to bring them to justice before German
Courts; at the earliest possible date,
4,	m the case under consideration, slight further delay has occurred,
owing to the fact that evidence has disclosed that victims in the case were
in many cases Austrian and Hungarian nationals, and therefore, under Control
Council Law $0 the German Courts have no jurisdiction, but it is hoped
that a very early decision will be arrived at as to the mode of trial
and that meanwhile, none ofjthe accused shall be released from internment.
5* It is requested that you will refer in all future correspondence to the
above reference*﻿

It is true, Her and then I have hit a man in the face with sy hand or
m the back with a stick. I liad to supervise,once a week, the dishing out of
food for a thousand men. There vsere acme young mm who had tliree dishes for
food instead of one. I warned such people that if they continued the
practice there would not be enough foot! for evexyom, lihen they contiimed
to do this, I hit theta tinder provocation because they -were abusive as well.
X was working in a wood cutting department with ay gang and X ms held
responsible for the woikaanship. There mare young chaps who purposely
kicked, the plaaied planks into the rand so that they were not clean. X was
beaten by the SS if the wood ms not clean and X bear aarks to this day.
In 1942 tire SS broke ay jaw and knocked out one of qy kidneys, I had the
choice-of either reporting a raan for disobedience, when he would be beatm on
a table, or beating them nyself. X prefereP, to beat tiian syself, shea the
Jews came into the. eaxip the roles took advantage of this and stole their food

beating which was very brutal. X preferred to punish them ayself. I never

was often necessary for mo to go to the wood-yard to collect wood for My work, and
I often saw HILAPdK beating the 'prisoners*

whether the investigating officers were bi-lingual in German „nd English and I
think before trial is ordered inquiries should be made with a view to ascdrtaining

of
Major Erank Pe^er CIA.PEA
Deposition on Oath of Major Frank Peter CA.QLA, Royal Artillery, of No .1
War Crimes Investigation Team, sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas
Humphrey TILLING, Loyal Artillery, No.1 War Crimes Investigation Team
at HOHNfi (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY, on 24th January 1946.
1.	' No.l War Crimes Investigation Team has for some time past been
engaged in collecting evidence at HOHNE (BELSEN) Gamp from ex-prisoners
of various Concentration Camps,	• •	-
2.	HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp is a large Gamp occupied by approximately
15,000 Displaced Persons of various nationalities, amongst these are
many former prisoners of BELSEN Concentration Camp, and,a large number
of ex-prisoners who were formerly in one or more of the other Concentrat-
ion Camps set up by the Germans. These persons have been able to give
valuable evidence regarding the conditions in such- Camps.
3.	During the past three months this Team has taken sworn statements
from approximate!, y 200 witnesses at HOHNE Gamp ana in cases where a
witness has made specific allegations against former personnel of a
Concentration Camp it Las not always been possible to obtain personal
identification of the accused even though the accused is in custody.
This is chiefly due to the fact 'that -th® majority of the accused persons
are located in one or other o'f the 8 C l. J's which are spread over the
British Zone and time has not permitatec, the taking of individual witness©
to the C.I.G's for the such purpose, -In these feir'eumste ices the methods
described in the following paragraphs have been used for identifying the
persons referred to ir. statements taken by personnel of this Team.
4.	Upon contact being made with a witness who wished to make-'
allegations against a named person, he or she.would be shown a large V
number of photographs of cx-concentration.camp personnel and amongst
which would be a photograph of the person named by the witness. The
book now produced to me marked FPC/I, was 'chiefly used for this purpose
although in some instance ^ the autnesses were shown a number of loose
photographs similar to thoc' epnialhed in this book. For the purpose
of reference each photograph w.s given, a serial number. In some cases
this serial number appears -on the face of the photograph but otherwise
the photographs were unmarked. The witness would be asked to select
the photograph of the person named, and. If such selection was correct
this was taken as sufficient identification and a statement would, then
be taken from the witness and the serial number of the photograph
referred to in the witness' statement -Would be the number of the
photograph so selected.
5.	In cases where a witness was unable to name a person but was able
to identify a photograph as being that of a’person against whom he or
she wished to give evidence, the Identification was checked by asking
questions ,of the witness regarding the nature of the duties, rank,
former location, the dates on which the person concerned was alleged to
have been at such location etc. and provided, that the.witness' answers
agreed with the history of the person- concerned, this was accepted
as sufficient identification.
6.	With regard to the photographs in series FC/l to FC/16,
inclusive, contained in exhibit FPC/l, It will be seen that these
photographs each show three persons and for the purpose of witnesses . \
statements,the person shown on the left of such photographs is'referred,
to as No.l, the person in the centre No.2 and the person on the right as
No. 3. In other cases where more than one person appears on a
photograph, thevpersons shown are numbered from left to right starting

1.	My name is Heinz Luder HEIDEMANN. I was born on 23rd
April 1908 at Mariendrebber, Kreis Diepholz, GEIM/iNY. I am of German
nationality.
2.	In May 1933 I joined the Allgemeine SS and on 5th
September 1939 I was attached to the 1st, SS Totentopf Infantry Regiment, y
My rartK was Schutze and on 1st July 1940 I was promoted to the ranis of
Rottenfuhrer,	,
3.	I received my training at Sreslau, Dachau and Heilbronn,
also at Munzingen. On 4th March 1940 I came to a labour camp at WEBELSBURG
near PMDERBOKN. I was employed as a guard on working commandos and also
as sentry on the guard tower. .At the end of May 1943 1 came to BELSEN
together with the entire guard commando, I did sentry duties there until
15fh January 1945 and, wa.s then, employed inside the camp as..a Block-leader.. Jl
4ftor one month, on 15th .February 1945, I was sent to an active unit at the
front and for a short time I served in t he 32 Reserve Bn,: I was wounded
on 7th March 1945 at Vogelsang on the Oder, came to the hospital.at Ay.;Ida,
and was taken prisoner by the British at Zeven on 24th April 1945.
I 4.	-"'l admit having sometimes beaten women with the hand
whilst employed inside the BELSEN Camp as Blockleader.
5,	Prom time to time the Company Chief of the Guard Company,
Hauptsturmfuhrer MEIER, read out to me instructions for the guards and before
he a- rived Untersturmfuhrer Gustav 8TKKESE used to do so. Amongst other
things they contained the order that we must not speak to prisoners or beat
them,
6.	The women I beat with the hand were mostlx llalsS. Hungarians
I ■and Greeks whcTwere very difficult to handle; there were also French and
Italian women under my supervision at BELSEN. At Webelsburg there were
only men, mostly German Bibelforscher, political and criminal prisoners
and those who had been anti social. As fax as I could judge as a mere
sentry,there were approximately 2/3rds German and the remainder were
Poles and Russians.
7.	I never saw SS personnel beat prisoners at YffiEELSBURG and
BELSEN, I only saw Capos and Foremen do so,
J8.	I cannot admit any of the accusations made against me. Only
tfedaetlites did-I hit women in-the. :£ace :with the hand*. I was alone as •3
Blockleader amongst six or,seven thousand...women and had only a female
supervisor to help me. Her name was Ursula SPORN. My task was to supervise
the dishing out of food and the cleanliness in the Camp.; this was difficult _
as conditions generally were very bad, due to the fact that sanitary
installations ' were''overtaoced by the overcrowding of the Camp. In order
to make my point it was necessary for me- to box prisoners ears from time
to time. Prisoners who came from AUSCHWITZ to BELSEN told me repeatedly
’Yfe are moved by the humane treatment afforded to us here1. At the Revier
Hut I was often told by prisoners 'Herr Blockfuhrer you are far too good*.﻿t

5,	Since I was: the 'only Heinz HEIDEl'HJ'lN at the
different Coups there can be no question of mistaken identity#

DE1-OSITION OP SENATE LASKER of dfSlffi, sVrom before me, Major Geoffrey
Smallwood, Major (Legal Staff), an Officer of the Staff of the Judge Advocate
General to the Forces.
1.	I. am 21 years of age and am a German Jewess. I was arrested on 16th
Septe&ber 1942' for being In possession of false identity papers. After a
period in prison I was sent to AUSCH\/ITZ on 7th December 1943 and was
transferred to BElSEN .on 1st. November 1944.
2.	Whilst in Auschwitz I had to go in hospital for three weeks and would
have been sent to the gas chamber if my sister who was a member of the band
had not persuaded TAUBER to spare me. In the hospital almost daily selections
were made, for the gas ■ chamber by SB Doctos KLEIN .and TAUBER and SB woman HASSn.
I name the following as also being responsible for sending many thousands to
the gas chamber:- SB men, MENGLIE, EMMERICH, KCNIG, GRAMMER and SB women,
DRECBSEER, UENIEGER and MANDEL.
3.	I also saw an SB Officer called HUSTEK help at selections and I
frequently saw him beat women. His description is: aged about 45, 5'10" in
height, medium build, grey hair, blue eyes, thick eye brows, and protruding-
square chin.
4.	About April 1944 SB Oberscharfuhrer BOGER beat a gypsy woman.so badly
that I saw her brought out of his office unconscious. His description is,
aged about 38, 6 ft in height, slim build, round shouldered, black hair, dark
sunken eyes, swarthy complexion and prominent cheek bones. >
5.	One day about October 1944 7,000 people were sent to the gas chamber.
6.	The SS woman DEECHSIER often interrogated women for petty offences
reported by SS men and unless they admitted the offence (usually smoking) she
would beat them brutally. I was her secretary for a time arid knew this was
true.
7i Borne time about August or September 1944 1 saw TAUBER beat a polish
male internee with a whip, so brutally that the whip cut one of his ears off.
8.	I also .Knew an SS woman called UENIEGER (sister of VOLKANRATH) , her
description is, aged about 26, 316" in height, medium build, brown hair,
(partly dyed blond.) dark upper lip and good features. I often saw her beat
women and especially naked 1 girls with a leather strap. I was told later
that she became involved in some trouble about jewellery and was sent to
Holland.
9.	At BELSEN I have seen much brutality, in particular I hove seen:- -

DEPOSITION OP KATA ROSENPELD (Spinster) late of Presov, Slovakia, sworn
before me Major Geoffrey Smallwood, Major (Legal Staff), Judge Advocate
General's Office.
1.	I was first arrested on 1st April 1942 for being a Jew. I came to
Belsen on 1st November 1944 and after about a month became one of the two
Chiefs of the larger of the two Sections of the women's camp in No, 1
Camp at Belsen. 'Stenia1 was the other one. Later I became the sole
Chief of the second women* s camp there.
2.	Early in April 1945 Voltenrath, the head of the Nomen's S.S. at
Belsen, came to me and said 'Would it net be better if they did as they
used to do at Auschwitz so as to save epidemics?' (Meaning put them in
the gas chambers). I said *You should give them more food' to which
VolKenrath made no reply.
3.	Volkenrath herself never shot anyone or beat than to death. At
Auschwitz she often beat women especially the elder ones but she liKed
young ones and most of them at Belsen were young*
4.	The week before the English came three girls working in a factory
in Belsen said that all Jewish girls were sent to a gas chamber. An S.S
woman Known as Emmy denounced them to Kramer or Volkenrath and they were
shot. Volkenrath herself told me this. Emmy left before the English
came. She was about 28 to 30 years of age, tall, strong and with fair
hair combed back straight,
5.	Rapportfuhrer Emmerich himself took the three girls who were
accused of trying to poison Stenia into the crematorium. They were then
alive but I know from the S.S. practice this means that they were shot
there. The girls were quite innocent and the cause of Stenia's illness
was that she had drunk too much.
6.	There was an S.S. woman named Faust at Belsen who for every little
fault put girls into the punishment company (strafkornmando). This meant
that they had to do very long and hard work suitable only for men under
the worst S.S. men (guards.
7.	Three S.S. men at Belsen were particularly brutal. Their names
were Heidammer* Muller and Bittner. They made a continual habit of
beating women until they bled for no particular reason. Bittner who was
Unterscharfuhrer frequently took away clothes and shoes from women if they
seemed to be in good condition.

Major P,Ingress Bell, D.A.A.G. Legal Staff, Jixlge Advocate General's Staff.
1.	I am 22 years old. I am a Jewess of Czecho-Slovalcian nationality.
I was arrested by the Germans in March 1942 and taken to AUSCHNITZ camp.
In January	I was transferred to BELSEN camp and employed as supervisor
over parties of women internees.
2.	I name 3 SS women as chiefly and jointly responsible for the death
of many women prisoners as mentioned hereunder. These women are:-
ELLERS, GOLLASCH, and VOLGENRAT.
3.	The prisoners worked under these three women collecting wood. On
one occasion two prisoners escaped from a party of 600. The remainder were
punished by being deprived of food and water for three days. After this
the very sick girls were specially chosen for this heavy work and numbers
were taken from the hospital. As a result of this many died from the
over work and the casual beatings they received. In March 1945 alone,
deaths from these working parties, working under the supervision of these
three women amounted to about 200 daily.
4.	In addition I name the women ELLERS as being responsible for great
cruelty to Helen BERKOVTTS. This girl was beaten by ELLERS and shut up
in an air raid shelter for about 2 weeks with little food or drink and
without bedding. The victim was ill for about a month afterwards and was
unable to get up. In addition to this case she treated many others in the
same way.
5.	I name SS ROTTENFUHKER HEIBMMANN. On numerous occasions he came to
my block and beat sick girls who were unable to get up to attend roll call.
Some of these girls were actually dying and did in fact die. I have seen
him batter their heads with a stick, kick their skulls in and grind their
faces with his heel. There were between 600 and 700 girls in the one block
and deaths were between 30 and AO per day all |:he time I was there.

into a Block. We rushed in to secure ourselves a decent bunk and
HEIDEMANN who v;as waiting for us inside started to Iflgat us. He got
hold of me, because I was too weak to climb up to one of ^the upper-
bunks, and began to hit me savagely with a heavy piece of wood, I
soon lost consciousness and when I came round, some time later, I was
unable to move my left arm, which was bruised and swollen. • It was
three weeks before I could use niy arm again.

SUMMABY of EXAMINATION of Franks. BACZKOTSEA of
Poland, duly sworn, states;
I am twenty years of age, of Polish nationality, born at BLALISIOCK,
Poland. ly permanent home is BOSUAIffiBSTRASSE 1, HLALISTCX3K, POLAND.
I am at present living at HOIS® (HELSEN), Gamp 4, Block L 3j Boom 32.
1,	I was arrested in June, 1943, because I am a Jewess. I was
sent for a few days to LUBLIN Concentration Camp, and was then transferred
to BLIZIN Concentration Camp. In June, 1944, I was sent to AUSCHWITZ,
and an the 1st January, 1945, I came to BSLSEN Concentration. Camp, where
X remained until the liberation.
I recognise the man on photograph No	as the man whom I
2.
knew as a Bloekfhhrer in H&LSEN, and I have now been told that his name
is Heins HEEMKHIf.
3.	On one occasion we were called on appell and I saw
BBUHSAHN beat my'girl friend, Neszka EMU-OLD, with a heavy stick over
the head and body. He then kicked her with his boots, and we had to
cany her back to the Block as she ms bleeding profusely. She ms unable
to go on any other appell but in spite of that HEIDSMANN beat her
repeatedly, and she died about four weeks afterwards. I was present when
her body was taken out of the Block by the LKICH35KS1AND0. I have
myself been beaten by KEXDBMANN on many occasions, and I had bruises and
marks on my body when liberated.
h No PC/7 as the man who ms
. I knew him by the name of
SGHBJUffil and I have been told now that his full name is Martin SCHRAMM.
I was employed in the tailors’ shop at HLIZXN where we had
to work for twelve hours every night. SCHRAMM used to come around the
Works' every night accompanied by a big dog and if we did not work fast
enough or had fallen asleep he set the dog loose on us. If he caught
any prisoner eating whilst at work h© took them out of the room and gave
them fifty strokes with a dog whip which he always carried and. with which
he beat the prisoners-in a brutal manner on many occasions without any
reason at all.
I CERTIFY that^I duly translated the above sumary to the witness
in the German language, prior to her signature which appears above.

I
DEPOSITION OP KATk HOSENPELD (Spinster) late of Presov, Slovakia,, sworn oefore me
Major Geoffrey Smallwood, Major (Legal Staff), Judge Advocate General's Office.
1.	I was first arrested on 1st April 1942 for being a Jew.	I came to
Belsen on 1st November 1944 and after about a month became one of the two Chiefs
of the larger of the two Sections of the women's camp in No. 1 Camp at Belsen.
'Stenia' was the other one. Later I became the sole Chief of the second
women's camp there.
2.	Early in April 1945 Volkenrath, the head of the Women's S.S. at Belsen,
came to me and said 'Would it not be better if they did as they used to do at
.
Auschwitz so as to save ejss epidemics?' (Meaning put them in the gas chambers,).
I said *You should give them more food' to which Volken^rath made no reply.
3.	Volkenrath herself never shot anyone or beat them to death. At
Auschwitz she often beat women especially the elder ones but she liked young
ones and most of them at Belsen were young.
\ "■ ^!b *t
4.	The week before the English cfeme three girls working in a factory xn
Belsen said that all Jewish girls were sent to a gas chamber. An S.S. woman
known as Emmy denounced them to Kramer or Volkenrath and they were shot.
Volkenrath herself told me this. Emmy left before the English came. cne
was about 28 to 30 years of age, tall, strong and with fair hair combed back
straight.
5.	Rapportfuhrer Emmerich himself took the three girls who were accused
of trying to poison Stenia into the crematorium. They were then alive but
1 know from the S.S. practice this mbans that they were shot there. The girls
were quite innocent and the cause of Stenia's illness was that she had drunk J
too much.
6.	There was an S.S. woman named Faust at Belsen who for every little
fault put girls into the punishment company (strafkommando) . This meant
that they had to do very long and hard work suitable only for men under the
worst S.S. men guards.
7.	Three S.S. men at Belsen were particularly brutal. Their names were
Heidammer, Muller and Bittner. They made a continual habit of beating women
until they bled for no particular reason. Bittner who was feersclaar^fuhrer﻿ascii frequently took away clothes and shoes from women if they seemed to be in good
condition.
SWOHN BY ME THE ABOVE NAMED KATA ROSENFELD THIS 3rd day of May 1945
AT BELSEN CAMP,
BEFORE ME THE SAID MAJOR GEOFFREY SMALLWOOD.
CERTIFIED THAT I HAVE ACCURATELY TRANSLATED THE EVIDENCE OF THE
SAID KATA ROSENFELD, AS HEDOHDED IN PRESENCE.

ATROCITIES AT
BELSEN AND HAMBURG
DEPOSITION of ANNELIESE KOHLfvlATH (Female) SS AUPSEHERIN
at NEUGRABEN and TIEPSTACK, HAMBOURG, late of St George, Hambourg,
sworn befciEfeLieiitenant-Dolonel LEOPCEJ) JOHN GENN, Royal Artillery,
Commanding, No 1 War Crimes Investigation Team.
1 *	I am 24 years of age and unmarried, and was employed as a
tram conductress in Hambourg. I was conscripted into the SS, on the
4th November 1944, and was employed as AUPSEHERIN at NEUGRABEN until
March 1945; then after a few days in TIEPSTACK also as'AUPSEHERIN. I came
by bicycle to BELSEN about seven days before April 15th 1945	^
2*	I cameto BELSEN unofficially and without oermission because I
wanted to assist one of the prisoners LOTTE WINTER who had been
z? in my working Korn an do in Camp at HAMBOURG . I was accompanied by
LOTTE WINTER'S fiance^, WILLIE BRACHMANN,who had escaped from AUSCHWITZ
to HAMBOURG where I met him in company with LOTTI WINTER*. I wished
to help this girl because I felt friendly towards her and she and sill
the other Czech girls had promised to take me to PRAGUE with them
if they attained their freedom.
3.	I believe that the girls in ray Work Koramando at HAMBOURG
all liked me although I admit that I beat tnara occasionally when they
did anything wrong, but they preferred to be beaten by me than by
the Commandant, and therefore the beatings I gave them did not make
them love me any less.
4.	The Coraraadant at both NEUGRABEN and TIHFSTACK to whom I refer
was HAlTPTSdffltftPUHRER FRITZ KLIE3L When I say that he was Commandant
I mean that he was in charge of the 500 hundred women in the Camp but
that in charge of all the small camps round HAMBOURG of which this was one
was HAUPTSTURMFUTRER WEBER and OBERSTURMFUHRER WIEDEMANN. Over these two
officers was the highest ranking SS officer in HAMBOURG whose name was
PAULI who had headquarters at NEUNGAMMLN and whose rank I believe was
STURMBANDFUHRER or OBERSTUHMBANDFUHRER
5«	I believe that HAUPTSCHAREUHRER FRITZ KLI5M was a pervert because
I often saw him beating girls and he obviously enjoyed it to such an extent
that occasionally one saw foam coming from his mouth. This beating
took place at a morning parade when offenders among the prisoners were
reported to him. He would call out the name of the girl and when she
came forward he would ask her whether she had committed the offence which
he read out. If she denied it he would hit her on the head with his
hands and then whether she admitted it or not she would be made to bend down,
remove her clothes and be given 25 strokes on the behind with a rubber tube
that was corked tip at both ends. He would tell them not to cry and if they
did he would go on beating them for at least another ten strokes. An
average of 2 or 3 girls were punished each morning and after they had
been beaten they had to fall in again on parade and KT.fl^T gave the order
that they were to be made to work harder than the others. It sometimes happened
that a woman was unable to get up having failed to the ground after her
punishment. KLIEM would then kick her once or twice and if she still could
not get up other women were allowed to come and assist her, but she was still
made to do her work.
6.	Apart from these beatings on parade I have seen KLtUt kick women
and strike them on the head for punishment and I have also heard of his
beating women with sticks at a time when I was out of the Camp with my
Working Party
-1-﻿
7*	The "beatings I gave were with a stick or a piece of plaited rope
or occasionally with my hands. I never beat the prisoners in the same
way as KLIM but I hit them on their shoulders or backs or hands and
occasionally on their faces. I can remember giving four or five such
beatings in March 1945 though I have no present recollection of any earlier
ones.
8.	When I arrived in BELSEN I was helped to get into the Camp
through a gap in the wire by WILLI BRACHMANN and I lived in the Camp
as an internee for several days with LOTTE WINTER until I was recognised
after the English arrived and handed over to the Commandant. We did not
get enough to eat or water to drink and the conditions were terrible.
9.	During my period as an internee at EELSEN my AUFSEHERIN were
GERTRUD PIEST and GERTRUD SAUER. The latter behaved well but the former
used to beat prisoners. I saw her on one occasion taking anumber of women
from one part of the Womens' Camp to another and on the way she was
hitting them with her fists and kicking them and alotgether treating than
brutally. I recognise PIEST and SAUER as Nos 4 and 5 on Photograph 19*
10.	Until two years ago when I became engaged to be married my sex
interests lay in the direction of women and I had affairs with women
over a period of nine months previously. ELIZABETH VDLKENRATH
has told me that IRMA GRK3E also has sex interests in women and that
while at AUSCHWITZ a love affair between GRESE and a woman internee
was nearly discovered and VQLKENRATH had to help GRESE to hush it up.
Lesbianism is not an offence under German Law but the SS punished women
for it according to their own rules and I heard of punishments for
this reason being given at NEUNGAMMM.

soLiO bread stolen from her bag and told KOKULJ'f' about it. In KOHDIJIN’s
presence the girl sOfirchod the bags of the other prisoners and in doing so

at a morning parade when offenders among the prisoners wore reported to him.
Ho would call out the nano of the girl and when she cane forward he would ask
her whether she had committed the offence which he road out. If she denied
it he would hit hor on the head with his binds and then whether she admitted
it or not she would bo made to bond dcr.m, remove her clothes and be given 25 strokes
on the behind 'with a rubber tube that was corked up at both ends. He would tell
them not to cry and if thoy did ho would go on boating them for at least another

they had been beaten they had to fall in again on parade and KLTEM gave the order

6. Apart from these beatings on parade I have seen KLIEM kick women and

Deputy Gamp Commandant at AUSCir..Tf2~BIREENAU and at RnVENSBRUCK,
3.	On the 2nd day after our arrival at AUSCK/ITZ all men, women, and children
who had oor.ie with our transport had to parade in one of the Blocks. SCffTARZHUEER
ordered everybody to strip completely ajid then inspected us and told different
people to move to one side. I noticed that he picked out all persons who did
not look very strong and many of the children. These people were then taken

6.	At AU3GHii/IT2WEiIHKEN.'JJ I was working In a Konmando wldch was carrying stones
near the gas chambers. The Torking site overlooked both the station where the
incoming transports wore unloaded and the gas chambers. I saw mapy transports
arrive and as soon as the people had climbed down from the truoks Doctor KITT
arrived and ordered them to fall in. Ho then inspected them and I saw him tell
all persons who •wore weak or did not loo1-: very fit, to move to cne side. Then
KITT ordered the people he had sorted out t > leave all their belongings at the
station and they wore then led to the gas chambers. Outside the gas chambers
KITT ordered the people to strip and I saw thn S3 tear the clothes off those,
who wore hesitant in doing so.	1CETT then ordered the people to march into the
gas chamber in batches of about 35 and when they had all gone, KITT wont back
to the station to sort out new transports. This wont on tliroughout the day,
every day of the week ana -I saw cone 1,000 people being disposed of daily in
this manner.
7.	I also recognise, on the photographs shown to mo, No»4 on Photograph 25
as an 33 woman from JtJ/ENHBRTJCK. I an now told that her name is Marta LINKE.
8.	She was one of the worst 33 women at AAVENSBRUCK and I often saw her beat
'women during Appoll. She used to hit women at random, with her hands and fists,
for no particular reason. Many so beaten bled heavily from the face. LINKE
also hit small children with her heavy gloves, so that they fell to the ground
bleeding.
9.	I also recognise the woman shown on Photograph DE/14 as an 33 woman from
RAVEK3BRUCK. I am now told that her name is Hertha SCHULZ.
10.	SCHULZ often beat women until they bled. One day in November 1943, when
I was pregnant, I, together with some other women, went to the kitchen to draw
rations lor our Block* Being pregnant. I felt vezy weak and hungiy and asked
another woman to get me a turnip from a .heap nearby, SCHULZ saw the woman
pick up the turnip and then got hold of her and beat her. She hit her in﻿i
■ - 2 -
t ho-face and ©yes with the clenched fits. I asked SCFIUhh to stop h#t4ing
the vronan as sho had picked up the turnip for ue at ny request, v/heroupon
she hit no in the face.
-I also recognise, froa "the photographs shown to ae. No.4 on Photograph 35
as an S3 woman from ’3NLSEN* I an no-w told her name is .mhelieso KOHEi'hdlN.
12, I first saw KOffiJOIN about throe weeks .before wo wore liberated, and she.
was in SS uniform. I. ws standing near the kitchen in the womens• camp,
together with other women, waiting for.food.	Prisoners brought up some turnips
and one of the women, a German by the name of Felene STH-USS, who was pregnant,
picked up one of these. thereupon iDHIal l'17! rushed from, the kitchen, got hold
of the woman and hit her savi-gely with her clenched fist and mickcd her with
her heavy boots. The woman bled from her nose and mouth and her face was ^
swollen for at least 8 days afterwards. i/hen I saw KOKLivLJIN 'agi-in, some days
later, sho had changed into prisoners clothes and she remained in thos until
wo were liberated.

54S>'.	'■<
Deposition on oath of Major Frank Peter CAOLA, Royal Artillery, of No.1
War Crimes Investigation Team, sworn before Dieutenant-Colonel Thomas
Humphrey TILLING, Hoyal Artillery, No .1 War Crimes Investigation Team
at HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANx, on 24th January 1946.
1.	No.l War.'Crimes Investigation Team nas for some time past been
engaged in collecting evidence at HOHN.E (BELSEN) Gamp from ex-prisoners
of various Concentration Camps.
2.	HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp is a large Camp occupied .by approximately
15,00G Displaced Persons of various nationalities, amongst these are
many former prisoner’s of BELSEN Concentration Camp, and a large number
of ex-prisoners who were formerly in one or more of the other Concentrat-
ion Camps set up by the Germans. These persons have been ablo to give
valuable evidence regarding the conditions in such Camps.
3.	During the past three months this Team has taken sworn statements
from approximately 200 witnesses at HO Hi a Camp and in cases where a
witness has made specific alleg.tions against former personnel of a
Concentration Camp it has not always been possible to ob tain personal
identification of the accused even though the accused is in custody.
This is chiefly diu. to the fact that the majority of the accused persons
are located in one or other of the 8 C.I.C's which are spread over tho
British Zone and time has not permi. ud the taking of individual witnosse
to the C.I.G's for th such purpose. In these circumstances the methods
described in the f.l.owing paragraphs have been us~d for identifying the
persons referred to iu statements taken by personnel of this Team.
4.	Upon contact being made with a witness who wished to make
allegations against a named p rsen, ho or : ic would bo shown a large
number of photograpis of -cc e ntr lie . c .mp personnel and amongs.t
which would bo a photogr pu of t.ic persoj. n med* by the witness. The
book now produced to me r.ir.ed FPc/l was chiefly used for this purpose
although in some instances .he wither3cs were shown a number of loose
photographs similar to thoo- cont.'n^ in this book. For the purpose
of reference each photograph was given a Serial number. In some casos
this serial number appears on the face of the photograph but otherwise
the photographs were unmarked. The witness would be asked to select
the photograph of the^person named and if such sclestion was correct
this was taken as sufficient identification and a statement would then
be taken from the witness anc. the serial number of the photograph
referred to in the witness' statement would be the number of the
photograph so selected.
5.	In cases where a witness war. unable to name a person but was able
to Identify a photograph as b ing t .at of a person against whom he or
she wished to give evidence, the identification was checked by asking
questions of the witness regarding tho nature of the duties, rank,
former location, the dates on which tho person concerned was alleged to
have been at such ^ scat:.on etc. and provided that the- witness' answers
agreed with the history of the person concerned, this was accepted
as sufficient identification.
6. With regard to the photographs in series FC/l to FC/l6,
inclusive, contained in exhibit FPC/l, it will be seen that these
photographs each show three persons and for the purpose of witnesses
statements,the person shown on the It ft of such photographs is referred
to as No.l, the person in the centxe No.2 and the person on the right as
No. 3. In other cases where more than one person.appears on a
photograph, thevpersons shown are numbered from left to right starting

SUMMARY OF EXAMEK&TION OF Franziska HORSAET OF AUSTRIA, duly sworn states:-
■» *
I am 24 years of age of Austrian nationality, bom at Uhterwart Kreis
Obexwart, Austria. My permanent address is Stegsback, Kreis, Furstenfeld,
Austria. I am at present living at Hock R.B.1 Room 10, H0HNE(1EIjSEN)CAMP
GEIMANY.
1.	I	was arrested at ay home	on 17th. April 1943, because
I ama	Gipsy,	and	taken	to AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU.	In August 1944 I was sent	to
the isolation camp (Quarantine) AUSCHWITZ and in September 1944 I was taken to
RAVENSBHUCK. About the end ef February 1945 I was. transferred to MAUT#HAUSEN
and 14 days later I was transferred to Belsen where I was liberated on 15th.
April 1945.
2.	I	have today been shown a	number of photographs and	from
these	I recognise	No.l	on Photo^aph FC 4 as a	man I know by the name of
SCHWARZHU12R who was Deputy Camp Commandant at AUSCHWITZ 1IRKENAU and
RAVENSBUECK.’
3.	On the second day after our arrival at AUSCHWITZ all
men, women, and children who had come with our transport had to. parade in
one of the Blocks. SCHWARZHU1KR ordered everybody to strip completely and
then inspected us and told different people to move to one side. I noticed
that he picked all persons who did not look very strong and many of the
children. These people were then taken away by the SS and I never saw any
of them again,....................
4.	At AUSCHWITZ in June 1942 SCHWARZHUIER held another
selection at our block. Again we had to undress and parade in front of him
and I saw SCHWARZHUIER pick out ny sister Maria HOBVART with her 8 months
old child Adolf HORWART, both Austrians. They were taken away with the
others who had been selected and I never saw them again.
5.	xe 1 also recogniie, on the photographs, shown to me, the
man on photograph MftlO. He.was a Doctor at AUSCHWITZ, I am now told that
his name is Dr. KITT.
6.	At AUSCHWITZ BIRKENAU, I was working in a Kommando which
was carrying stones near the Gas Chambers. The working site overlooked
both the station where the incoming transports were unloaded and the
Gas Chambers. I saw many transports arrive and as doon as the people
had climbed down from the trucks Dr. KITT arrived and ordered them to fall
in. He then inspected them and I saw him tell all persons who were weak or
did not look very fit, to move to one side. Then KITT ordered the people
he had sorted out to leave all their belongings at the station and they
were then led to the Gas Chambers. Outside the Gas Chambers KITT ordered
the people to strip and I saw the SS tear the clothes off those who were
hesitant in doing so. KITT then ordered the people to march into the Gas
Chamber in’batches of about 35 and when they had all gone, KITT went back
to the station to sort out new transports. This went on throughout the
day, every day of the week and I saw some 1,000 people being disposed of
daily in this manner.
7.	I also recognise on the photographs shown to me
No.4 on Bhotograph 25 as an S^ woman from RAVENSBRUCK. I am now told that
her name is Marta LUtKE.
8.	She was one of the worst SS women at RAVENSBRUCK and
I often saw her beat women during Appell. She used to Hit: women at random
with her hands and fists for no particular reason. Many so beaten bled
heavily from the face. LINKS also hit small children with her heavy gloves
so that they fell to the ground bleeding.
I also recognise the woman shown on photograph DE 14
9﻿as an SS woman from EA.VENSBEIX3K.
SCHULZ.
I
am now told that
her name is Hert
10.	SCHULZ often beat women until they bled. One day
in Norember 1943» when I was pregnant, I, together with seme other
women went to the kitchen to draw rations for our block. Being present
I felt Wery weak and hungry and asked another weman to get me a turnip
from a heap nearby. SCHULZ saw the woman pick up the turnip and then
got hold of her and beat her. She hit her in the face and eyes
with the clenched fist. I asked SCHULZ to stop hitting the woman as she
had picked up the turnip for me at my request, whereupon she hit me in the
face.
•	• : w	- v	..	•	» ■
11.	I also recognise on the photographs shown to me,No.4
on photograph 35 as an SS woman from Belsen. I am now told her name is
Anneliese KOHLMANN.
12.	I first saw KOHLMANN about three weeks before we
were liberated and she was in SS uniform. I was standing near the kitchen
in the woman's camp together with oliier women waiting for food. Prisoners
brought up some turnips and one of the women, a German by the name of
Helene STRAUSS, who was pregnant, picked up one of these. Thereupon
KOHLMANN rushed from the kitchen, got hold of the woman and hit her savagely
with her clenched fist and kicked her with her heavy boots. The woman
lied from nose and mouth and her face was swollen for at least 8 days after-
wards. When I saw KCHIA1ANN again, some days later, she had changed into
prisoners clothes and she remained in those until we were liberated.

War Crijnas Trial - OUSSBLggl
Th« President. (Lt-Col. Lai SCO;'BE)
OQHFIDSK UAL.
On V June 1+6 at 1600 hours I pho#d the British
Military Kission at The Kaguo and spoke to the ?/capt. ’A*,
the only officer there who deals with «ar Crd es. He informed
me that there were two more prosecution witnesses on their way to
UJNKBURG.
I than enquired the exact Position re defence witnesses.
He stated that they had all been contacted by the Dutch Police
through the ministry of Justice, with the exception of one, who
could not be traced and who was purported to be in America. The
S/Gapt. had not got the papers with him (he was^in his own office)
but thought that the man was Dr. rtt’INXO. I confirmed that altough
the remainder had been told they were required in the defence of
a man "on trial fqr his life" they were still unwilling to come.
I also confirmed that amongst them was Kenny de HAAS. The S/Capt* s
opinion was that these people would not act as witnesses for fear of
themseized becoming implicated.
'■	/ i k
BMM The Hague are awaiting a written statement from
the Dutch Ministry of Justice concerning the unwillingness of these witnesses
to attend. This report will be sent from HM to BAQR and I told
the S/Gapt. to send a copy to this HQ at the same time.

fourteen days. Prom there I was sent to NEUHRGAHHE Concentration Camp,, arriving
there about the beginning of September. I was heart taken to WILHEIIEHA.'VHN
where I stayed until the 2nd April 1945. On that day I and several hundred other
prisoners were sent to BEISEN Concentration Camp, arriving there after a few days
journey.
3.	On arriving at BElSER we were offered some soup in exchange for either
bread or cigarettes and only those prisoners who could give up some bread or
cigarettes were able to obtain soup.	We were taken to our blocks. I was in
block 12. The whole camp was grossly overcrowded and at ni$it six hundred of us
■were locked in a hut which might have accommodated one hundred. There was not
sufficient room to lie down and we had to spend the night sitting up and jansned
up against each other. At least eight or nine prisoners died each night. All
the internees in ray block were men, mostly Russians and Poles with seme French and
a mixture of other European races.
4,	At 3-30 a.m. we had to get up and go on Appel-parade-Ttoere we had to
stand to attention until 8 a.m. We were then formed into parties of five and
started dragging corpses to the burial pits. There were thousands of corpses
lying in heaps almost all over the camp.
5.	The German S3 personnel - guards and others - were brutal to all
prisoners. Every guard carried a stick or a piece of wood with which they
continually beat internees on the head for no reason at all. I myself was
beaten many times by the camp staff but I cannot say the names of any of the
guards as I never knew their names.
6.	Prisoners were shot out of hand indiscriminately, again for no reason
at all, and all day shots could be heard all over the camp. prisoners who were
Shot or beaten to death were left lying on the ground until seme time later when
their bodies were taken off to the burial pits.
7.	. During my first four days at BEISEN I received in all not more than
one pint of watery swede soup and one mug of water. During my last five days
before the British troops entered the camp I had nothing to eat and nothing to
drink.
8.	Whilst dragging corpses to the burial pits I noticed that in many cases
a piece of flesh had been cut off the body, generally from the back of the thigh
and I was told that the flesh had been cut off and eaten. I myself saw on
several occasions internees cutting flesh off corpses and stuffing it into their
mouths, eating it like animals.
9.	I cannot say the names or nationalities of any of the internees whom I
saw killed or beaten as we did not know each others names or nationality. JfoSk,
nan t identify any of the guards who beat and killed internees. I can only say
“ that- all the guards and officials habitually’ ill treated all internees in this way.
10.	I an of British nationality.

Deputy Director of Medical Services,Second Army, sworn before Lieutenant-
Colonel Leopold John Germ,Royal Artillery, Commanding No.l War Crimes
Investigation Team.
1.	I have made a full and detailed report of the conditions pertaining
in BE3LSEN Camp, a copy of which is in the hands of all relevant authorities,
and as to which I swore an Affidavit before. Judge Advocate General,War
Office, on 15th June 1945»
2.	On 15th April 1945, in the early afternoon, I entered BELSEN Camp
under the terms*’of the Truce of that day’s date, in my capacity ae Deputy-
Director of Medical Services, Second Anny.
5. At approximately 1800 hours on the afternoon of 15th April 1945 I
was interrogating JOSEF KRAMER,Commandant of BELSEN Camp, in company with
Lieutenant—colonel Richard Taylor,D.S.0.,Royal Artillery, Commanding 63rd
Anti-Tank Regiment,Royal Artillery, a Battery of which Regiment provided
the first British troops to do duty in BEL3EIT Camp,
lu At about this time a runner came to report shooting by SS Guards at
the Western end of the Men’s Camp. I proceeded immediately to the spot
in company with Lieutenant-colonel Taylor, taki: g JOSEF KRAMER with us.
5.	At the ’Western end of the Men’s Camp, some -thirty yards due East of
the Gate leading thence to the crematorium, I found a stack of straw-
covered potato plants.- A number Of male internees of the Camp were
foraging in the stack for food. Surrounding them were ihree or four
individual members of the SS' Guards of the Camp armed v/ith automatic
weapons of Sten Gun type. As I approached the spot X saw and heard'them
firing single,- shots at the aforesaid internees and they made no attempt
to cease firing when I came up to them,JOSEF KRAMER made no attempt to
prevent them or to interfere,
6.	Such firing was indiscriminate and gave the impression of being a
customary pastime. Several dead and dying internees were lying on and
around the potato stack, X saw one or two fall as a result of-the firing
as I approached, I am unable to identify the SS Guards responsible for the
firing but have been shown photographs of the SS Guards now in our custody
and No, 3 on photograph 24> whose name I am informed is STEEEIAN KONRAD,
appears to me to resemble strongly one of the Guards involved,
7.	We gave iimiediate orders to KRAMER that all shooting at internees
was to cease immediately,and that any further case reported to us would
result in one SS Guard being shot for eveiy internee killed. I also
directed that the dead and wounded be removed for burial end medical
attention respectively.At least one of the dead was carried avfsy on ny
orders by JOSEF KRAMER, who showed the utmost reluctance to comply with
the order,
8.	Despite my orders single shots were to be heard around the
perimeter of the Camp, some of which may have come from the Guard towers,
during -the next 16 to 18 hours-.
9.	I formed the strongest impression that such shooting at internees *
was a popular sport among the Guards for no adequate reason since I am
convinced that no attempts to escape were made after the British occupation
commenced, A further repitition of orders to shoot one for ofte was
necessary before this could f inally be stopped.
/10.﻿s/.

10. On the 16th April 1945 it was reported to me that some of-the
“oilers employed as guards by ihe SS had broken Into and looted
the food stores. It was further reported that food sent by charitable
organisations, principally Jewish,for the use of internees, was customarily
e,ofA guards. I issued stringent orders to
the Hungarians in this regard and no further such looting was reported.
H. In regard to the generally deplorable condition of the Como and

1.	IMTRODUCTI CM.
As the result of a visit to HOBCorps by two German Bnissaries
of the Wehrmaoht under a white flag, information was received of the
location of this Concentration Camp at BELSEN# and the existence there of
some 60,000 prisoners, said to be mainly political; 1,500 of them were
said to be suffering from Typhus fever; 900 to have contracted typhoid and
•that there was a large number of cases of other conditions, infectious and
otherwise,	' :
& ■ ■ - _ • - . ’
As a result of this information two officers of the staff of 8
Corps HQ were conducted to HQ 1st German Para. Army where negotiations
took place to obviate any fighting over this area or the possible liberat-
ion of such a large number of infected personnel. 1

of 5 Compounds, 3 for men and 2
The total number of prisoners was given to me on lb Apr 45 as
Women -	28,185.
Men	.	-	12,000 (Approx).
The sizes of these Confounds varies considerably; in the case of the men,
containing from approx 1,500 to 8,000 and the two women's enclosures (No.l)
. 23,000 and (No. 2) approx. 5»000. In the former was one enclosure said to hold
approk 5QQ children. In both men's and women's compounds conditions in the huts
varied-'consider ably, some being bunked with 2-3 tiered bunks,whilst in others
the prisoners just lay crowded together on the.floor-. Except in men's confound
No.3, there were certain huts set aside for use as hospital huts,but, except
in one of the men's .compounds and in the large women's enclosure, these were
quite inadequate.. They were n6t even all bunked as the following figures will
show.
Women's Compounds.. Number of prisoners acutely ill suffering from,
definite diseases exclusive of malnutrition was approx 2,000 and for
these there were only 474 bunks. In consequence each was occupied by
2 or 3 women, the remainder, including practically all typhus patients,
just lying on the bare boards.' In Compound No.2 there was,one hut only
set aside as' a hospital hut, and this was v/ithout any beds. In this,
compound typhus patients were not segregated.
Men's Compound. Hospital conditions in these compounds were not -as good
as those in the Women's compounds, ^although there were rather more bunks.
1959 for 2242 acutely ill. In compound No.3 no huts at all had been
set aside.
Up to the time of their liberation it is understood that all
personnel had been strictly confined to their particular compound and
there was no mixing at all.
Cookhouses. There were 5 cookhouses within the precincts of Camp No.l.
Two for men, two for women and one mixed cookhouse. Their size varied,
but in the majority of cases 2 to 3 cookings had to be done for each meal.
•The number of meals varied from 2 to 3 per diem and
consisted only of a soup of vegetables, mainly carrots, dried cabbage
. potatoes, thickened with meal. Very occasionally small amounts of meat
Were added.
Water.	There were two or three small concrete ponds within the
> canp fSPOm which prisoners could draw water, but as practically ail
supplies were dependent upon electrical pumping there had been no water
at all for several days owing to the cables'being cut.
Crematorium. At the .bottom end^of the camp was a crematorium consisting
of one oven which apparently had not been used for some time as the
/number.﻿number of de&ths, had bean increasing

Consisted of a main Office ouilding and litring' tuifa*	for

disinfestation chambers, each capable of doing 60 sets of clothing
in l-g- hours. In this latter building were 15 showbr baths.	*'•

Pang) No. 2^ This had only very recently been formed (about one week) by
over a portion of the Barrack area. Aoconsnodation here was naturally very much
better but all the buildings were grossly overcrowded and had of course got ^
already in a filthy condition. However-, the majority of the inmates were in
moderately good condition,* aiid there was no record of any oases of Typhus# The
prisoners were divided into barrack blocks by nationalities which made super-
vision considerably easier. One block had been set aside as a Hospital.
Barrack Area. Adjoining these 2 Gamps and a continuation of Camp
No.2 was a most magnificent barrack area with every possible facility - gofyl
canteens, cookhouses, excellent garages and stabling, a cinema, good married
qdarters and a beautiful Officers' Mess.
In this barrack block area were 8 hospital blocks
housing at the time they were seen 601+ German Military patients, whilst in
beautiful surroundings just-beyond the officers' mess was an excellently appoint'
ed Military Hospital of 500 beds.
4. INVESTIGATIONS OARRIKD num.
15 Apr 45.
JOSEPH KRAMER (Commandant) was interviewed by Lt.Col. Taylor,D30
(Allied Military Oommander). and myself, and whilst this was being carried
out there was te sound of intermittent small arms fire but no indication
that this was within the camp area. However, a runner arrived to say that
there was rioting at the Central Cookhouse. On arrival there everything
seemed quiet, but- one SS man stated that there had been stealing of soup.
There was no evidence of this. Rifle fire continued to be heard, this time
near at hand, .and on proceeding through the camp, SS Guards were found to
be shooting prisoners who in their hungry condition were endeavouring to
remove potatoes from a pile near the cookhouse.
Commandant KRAMER made no attempt to stop his meii and it was only
on a threat, to shoot.the SS personnel immediately, on a basis of one for one.
should any further killing take place that the situation became quiet.
Neither Commandant KRAMER nor any of his personnel made any attempt to
succour the wounded and dying, nor to remove the dead. An order was given
to tins effect and the Commandant himself nia.de to assist.
There was naturally considerable excitement amongst the prisoners
who were thronging the Central road outside their Compounds.. Their welcome
was exuberant, ^but at that time absolutely orderly, find although it was
extremely difficult to induce them to return within their compounds, tills
was eventually done.
A detachment was left within the camp to maintain order and tanks
positioned near the main food store. Instructions mere also given to all
enemy guards tliat unless there was any mass attempt to escape outside the
perimeter of the camp all firing should be high. *
/During.﻿
During the night there was intermittent
single shots and automatic weapons had to be
firing high to discourage looters. There were no
kind during the night and everything' was orderly
In addition to the COHmandant I saw the Senior German S3 Mtedioal
Officer KLEIN who .confessed complete ignorance pf the position*stating
that he had only been there a few days. I consider this an evasion as
although he may only have been in charge for a few days, I was informed
by many prisoners that he had been at the Gamp for several months. He
was the only SS Medical Officer in Camp 1.
To him and also the Senior Administrative Medical Officer (STAELHl)
for the area, I gave a questionnaire which was to be completed by the
following morning (16th). This questionnaire covered the following
points;-
1. A nominal roll of the Medical Staff, Male and Female,-.with
any special appointments held.
*2. Number of Hospitals.
3.	Bed state in each Hospital.
4.	Diseases by types and numbers in eaoh.
5.	Medical stores available, to include vaccines.
6.	Food position, including special food for the seriously ill.
7.	Disinfesters available, number and capacity.
8.	Bathing facilities.
9.	Laundry facilities.
10. Disinfectants available.
11. Protective clothing,if used, and the amounts available.
12. Clothing for prisoners available.
13.. Laboratory facilities.
During the attempt to peacefully persuade the inmates to return to
their compounds it was abundantly obvious that conditions were appalling.
Numerous dead bodies were seen which could not have resulted from the
recent shooting, one inmate reported that the huts too contained large
.numbers of corpses sharing the accommodation with the living.
Many of the inmates talked to were pbviously well bred and
intelligent. Their condition was pitiable in the extreme and although
many stories of their hardships were told it in no way prepared one for
the indescribable horrors seen on the following day.
16 Apr 45. At 0830 hours a rapid tour of the whole area of both Camp 1 and
^ Camp 2 was arranged and during this a prepared statement was broadcast
in four languages td all prisoners, announcing that German control of '
the Camp was at an end and had been taken over by the British forces.
The inmates were premised help of all kinds and exhorted to remain
quiet so that the efforts of the troops to aid them could be facilitated.
The Commandant KRAMER, in a Jeep and guarded by CMP's, was
instructed to lead the way to the Crematorium and. asked whether there
were any open graves. He without shame led the way to the pit referred
to above, which contained large numbers of. blackened oorpaes and on the
way two large piles of naked c.brpsea, all mere skeletons were passed.
Each pile must hkite contained well over a 100 bodies. of men who must
have died within the last few days. It was found that these inmates had
only recently been moved to BELSEN and to accommodate them certain of the
barrack BlockS had been taken over.
/On.﻿Page 6
On e'ompletion of this tour and following a conference, a- more detailed
inspection of Can?) No.l was commenced. A large proportion of the ordinary
living huts and all so callted Hospital accommodation was inspected in detail.
Although conditions were much the same-in all compounds there were
certain general points arising in each.
Men*8 Compounds.
No.l. Typhus was on the wane and reached its peak in iiarch. It is
understood that it commenced early in February.
No.2. This wfes the largest men's compound and contained approx
8,000. Typhus had commenced here at a later date than in
. - Compound 1 and had now reached its peak. There were 266
oases and now cases were still occurring, but the medical
members considered that the worst was over. It was in this
Confound 'that the story of cannibalism was reported to me
by one of the doctors.
There had been none for the last 2 days but before that there
had been many oases.
No.3. There were many fewer inmates in this compound pnd no hut set
aside as’a.hospital.
Conditions in many of the huts were indescribable, several
dead bodies could be seen* in some cases moved up to the ends,
in others left just as they lay. Only by entering the huts
could the cases of extr/eme emaciation be seen, so mary
obviously past any help however skilled.
The* gutters outside the huts contained living and dead. There
was no attempt at sanitation whatsoever, the men just squatting
anywhere. '
Women1s Compounds.
No.l. This was a very large compound containing approximately
23,000. Conditions here were much the same as in the men's
compounds except that in a greater proportion there had been
attempt^ to preserve order and some semblance of cleanliness.
There did’seem, however, to me more cases of extreme emaciat-
ion amongst the women that: the* men and in hut 208 conditions
were appalling. Practically every inmate was so weak that
they could hardly raise themselves and the passage was equally
crowded with both living and dead.
Not so many dead bodies were'left for any length of time in
the huts or surroundings but in the middle of the compound
and practically adjoining the children's area was a very large
area of naked women piled high. It must have1 contained many
•	hundreds.	,	. . •
The hospital block in this compound was a paradise compared
to ary others and I can't speak too highly of the efforts of,
certain of the women doctors. One woman Gynaecologist -was
conducting all the obstetric cases, averaging 5*to 7 per day,
and for some days without -aiy water supply available.
The care that had been taken of the children was also most
noticeable. .	,
In this cozippund, however,' the number of bunks, available for
Hospital oases was grossly inadequate. 474 for a total of appro
2,000 acutely ill. In many cases there were 5 in each bunk,
and the condition in the Typhus ward where there were no bunks
at all was indescribable. The same applied to the men's compou-
nd. The typhus in this compound was well segregated and was
definitely on the wane. There were approx 250 oases here. Out
of the 23,000 inmates of the compound medical personnel esti-
mated that there were oot more than 5,000 well.﻿k
set aside as a Hospital and this had no bunks in it. There was no
segregation of typhus, of which there were 300 oases.
. Medical Supplies
These were supplied from a central store in the administrative
block. The medical personnel said that drugs and dressings were
available but very frequently not those most‘necessary. Dressings
Dressings hadr.been very short. No. vaccines were-available nor any
from of anti-louse powder for the control of typhus. No disinfect-
ants were available.
When the Medical Stores was inspected certain Red Cross boxes were
found containing tinned milk, meats etc. It was explained that •
these were part of a very large stock sent by Jewish Societies for
Jews. These had been stolen by the German Guards and none issued* ^
except very occasionally a small issue of sweets to the children. '
Only in those who had obviously beep in a short time was
clothing adequate. Large numbers were in German Hospital cloth-
ing. The fact that all corpses were placed in piles naked was, I
think,due to the fact that bodies were stripped to see if any
better articles of clothing could be obtained.
The meals consisted entirely of soup made with meal or
flour .and vegetables, mainly carrots, dried cabbage, potatoes,
turnips eto., with a very occasional and scanty sprinkling of small
cubes of meat. The method qf distribution was by galvanised con-
tainers carried from the kitchens to the various blocks by the
prisoners themselves. It is obvious therefore that no equality of
distribution could even be organized and the moment anyone’ became
to weak to fend for himself the chance of obtaining any food
became more and more''remote.
There had been none for days owing to the failure of the
electricity. It was pitiable to see both men and women standing
naked in their compounds endeavouring to keep themselves clean from,
a teacupful of water.
In this camp there could be no shame and no sex. „
Control,
' There were certain individuals, one per block, appointed as block
leaders. They were, I supposed, to keep order and organise the general admini-
stration including feeding arrangements for their, respective blocks. All sigm
were made by whistle.

6. mELIMINARY MEASURES TAKEN TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS.	•-„
By the afternoon of the first day (l6th) 27 watercarts were provided by 8
Corps, and a supply of food in tins for the evening meal. All initial supplies
had obviously to be carefully guarded and issue supervised.
The psychological effect of this provision was amazing, and each day the
atmosphere in the camp has improved, changing from one of extreme apathy through
the gradual appearance of a spark of vitality to real joy and an interest in life.
The magnitude of the Medical problem in the supervision of special feeding and
supervision of feeding for those cases of starvation cannot be over-estimated.Steps
have already been taken to provide a special gastric diet for these oases and an
attempt to mobilise helpers to ensure that the weakest are fed, until such time as
they can be moved to a new hospital area.
e
General Policy.
(a) The complete evacuation of Camp 1 and I hope its destruction by fire.
;	(b) The establishment of a transit area in the present administrative
building which includes the present bath-house and disinfestors.
Through this will be passed all inmates who are well, and they will be
dusted with AL 63 plus bathing where possible.
w	k 7.
‘(c) Gamp ■ 2 will be evacuated immediately of all fit personnel who will be
removed either to D.P. Camps or accommodation in the Barrack area.
There have been no cases of Typhus in this camp.
(d)	The fit and. well in Camp 1 will be bathed, dusted and issued with new
clothing where necessary and evacuated to the far end of the Barrack
area.
(e)	An area of the barrack blocks (8 of which contained German Military
wounded) has been evacuated either to neighbouring German hospitals or
in the case ‘of the Hungarian Guard to other accommodation; this will be
set aside as a hospital area and all acutely ill removed immediately to
this location, passing through a reception area en route. The cases of
malnutrition and starvation will also be passed through a reception area
where they can be carefully examined and passed to the appropriate
destination. The German officers' Mess has)been taken over for the
reception of the worst oases of starvation not suffering from communi-
cable infectious disease. These will be nursed by British Nursing
Officers.
Nursing in the main hospital area will be carried* out under the super-
vision of British male personnel' by Prisoner Medical Officers and
Nurses assisted by German Nurses mobilised for the purpose. Large
numbers can be made available.	\
Special Measures.
(a) The following medioal units were moved in on the 17 Apr 45*
« . - • ’•••'"* r •	. *. •
One CCS.	_
*	One Light Field Ambulance.
.	Two Field Hygiene* Sections (one came in on first day)."
One mobile Bapt. Lab.	'﻿
i’age S-(p/y
(b)	Immediately following' th© first detailed inspection* requests were
made for :-
Eroteotive clothing.
Large quantities of Sulphaguanidine.
Welfare facilities to be put in train including provision
of Postal facilities.	*
Papers to be ready as soon as required.
Help from UMRA teams if possible of Varied nationalities
.and Red Cross teams.
Visit of Members of Typhus Commission.
(o) Large stores of captured German drugs and dressings will be made *--
available.
(d) All fortas of clothing and ordnance stores were demanded and where
possible will beprovided from captured German stock. Large quantities
are already on the way. Women's clothing will.probably have to be
demanded from German civilian sources.
(e) All food of a luxury nature and suitable for the special feeding.of
these patients was impounded from the local Hosp stores and arrange-
ments will be made for resupply of eggs, milk and butter frm the
surrounding districts.	.. -
7. SUMMARY.
1.	It is unnecessary to enlarge! on the horrors of the Concentration Gaum.
Nothing like it has ever been seen by anyone who has yet visited the Camp, and
*	: the photographs attached as Appx 'C fail to reproduce the worst horrors
which could only be appreciated by seeing the inside of the worst huts.
2.	The Camp No. 1 will be evacuated completely, priority being given to
the acutely ill and the fit and well whose removal can proceed simultaneously
Next will leave those suffering from malnutrition with a reasonable expect-
ation of survival, and finally the whole community. During this period
supervised feeding will take place of all those in Camp 1 awaiting removal.
It is considered that.this will give the greatest chance and expectation of
life to the greatest number.
3.	All protective measures are being taken and extrfi help demanded. Typhus
inoculation will be carried out on all those requiring it and the necessary
period of quarantine imposed.
Should Bacteriological examination prove the presence'of Typhoid to
any extent inoculation by TAB will be considered if supplies are available.
4.	The original estimate of the number of cases of Typhus 1,500 was
probably too high. The dctual figure is probably between 900 - 1,000.
..	„	comprises a preliminary repbrt on the conditions existing at the
time of liberation and is based .on continuous observation throughout the first 4
days. A further report will be rendered when more accurate statistics should be

DEPOSITION
of
Deposition on oath of Major Frank Peter .CAOLA, Royal'Artillery, of No.l
War Crimes Investigation Team, sworn before Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas
Humphrey TILLING, Royal Artillery, No.l War. Crimes Investigation Team
at HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp, GERMANY,' on 24th January 1946.'
1.	No.l War Crimes Investigation Team has for some time past been
engaged in collecting evidence at HOHNE (BELSEN) Gamp from ex-prisoners
of various Concentration Camps.
2.	HOHNE (BELSEN) Camp is a large Camp occupied by approximately
15,000 Displaced Persons of various nationalities, -amongst these are
many former prisoners of BELSEN Concentration Camp, and a large-number
of ex-prisoners who were formerly in one or more of the other Concentrat-
ion Camps set up by the Germans. These pbrsons-have been able to give
valuable evidence regarding the conditions in such Camps .
3.	During the past three months this Team has taken sworn statements,
from approximate! y 200 witnesses at HOHNE Gamp and in cases where a
witness has made specific allegations against former personnel of a
Concentration Camp-it has not always been possible to obtain personal
identification of the accused even though the accused is In custody.
This is chiefly due to the fact that the majority of the accused persons
are located in one or other of the 8 C.I.C's which are spread over the
British Zone and time has not ^permitted the' taking of individual witnesses
to the G.I.-G’s for the such purpose. In these circumstances the methods
described in the following paragraphs have been used for identifying the
persons referred to in statements taken by personnel of this.Team.
4.	Upon contact being node with a witness who wished to make
allegations against a named person, he or she would be shown a large
number of photographs of cx-concentration camp personnel and amongst
which (would be a photograph of the n'.-rson named by the witness. The
book now produced to me marked FPC/1, was chiefly used for this purpose
although in some instances the witnesses were shown a number of Idose
photographs similar to those contained in this book. For the purpose
of reference each photograph was given a serial number. -In some cases
this serial number appears on the face of the photograph but otherwise
the photographs were unmarked. The witness would, be asked to select
the photograph of the person named and if such selection was correct
this was taken as. sufficient identification and a statement would then
be taken from the witness and -the serial number of the photograph
referred to in the witness' statement would be the number of the
photograph so selected.
5.	In cases where a witness was unable to -name a person but was able
to identify a photograph as being that of a person against whom he or
she wished to give evidence, the identification was cheeked by asking
questions of the witness regarding the nature of the du-ties, rank,
former lo.cation, the dates on which the person concerned was alleged to
have been at such location etc. and provided that the witness' answers
agreed with the history of the person concerned, this was accepted
as sufficient identification.
6.	With regard to the photographs in series FC/l to FC/l6,
inclusive, contained in exhibit FPC/l, it will be seen that these
photographs each show three persons and for the purpose of witnesses . . ■
statements,the person shown on the left of such photographs is referred
to as No.l, the person in the centre No.2 and :>the person on the right as
No. 3. In other cases where more than one person appears on a
photograph, thevpersons shown .are numbered from left to right starting

fy " emanent homo is : 0J5BCHCWA 3, W1LK0.
I an at present living at ; Camp 2, Kitchen 18, HCffilS (SELSSU)- CAMP, GSRMAKY.
1.	I was arrested in the autumn of 194-2 ■end taken to the Ghetto at WILNO. In the
autumn of 1943 I was transferred' to various LABOUR CAMPS in EaTHQUIA. and from there
came to the COMCSMl'RATION GAMP at STUTTHCF nr. DMS1G, in August 1944.° .Subsequently
I was taken to SOHOMBSRG CCNCMT^ATI® CAMP and arrived at BiiLSM in February 1945.
2.	I have been shown a photograph marked "?/5/10" and I recognise No.40 thereon aa
an S3 man whom I first met at BELSEN C(3NPG3NTRATICN GiM.IP. X did not know Ms name,
wiiich I am now told is KARL SCHMITT.
3» At BSLSEN I lived in Block 15 in the mens* camp No.l. TMs Block was filled Mth
sick prisoners, the majority of which were unable to get up and be pre'sent at the
daily morning Appels. SCHMITT was one of the many S3 men who came round in the
morning to check the prisoners and to take the roll call at these Appels. Their
method consisted in getting as many of the sick and weak prisoners on parade as
possible. For that j^urpose they would enter the block and, rslng brutal force, would
make the men get up by beating and kicking thou with sticks, dhovels, fists, hands
and boots. . On these occasions SCHMITT behaved like, a ferocious oava e, and Ms
appearance in the block was enough to make, whoever was able to, ran away or get into
hiding.
4. About a month before the British arrived at BILSI3N I was lying in tMs block,
suffering from an open, festering wound on my right thigh as a result of a beating with
a shovel by one of our hut-orderlies, named JOS.aF MAGIERA, (Because tMs hut-orderly
used to steal our breadration and exchange it for other food and cigarettes, I
reported him to the "Blockalteste". Ever since then MAGISRA was on my heels,
threatened and beat me for the slightest offence dr for no reason whatever). On that
morning, SCHMITT came round as usual to chase the sick prisoners cri^t. I could hardly
move; he saw me lying there and started to beat me savagely with a wooden stick
across ny face, anas, shoulders and kicked me with Ms bootd on ay body and my legs.
rntor^roter:
(Overjj﻿This went on for ab'out 5 to 10 minutes. I was bleeding profusely from mourn
and nose, and as a further result of this beating 3 teeth in the left upper
Jaw were looseded tp such a degree, that I had to have them pulled out after
the liberation. SCHMITT then went away,	"
I kept out of his way,

The deponents Wladislaw Byrsfci and sSoiuel Curt Doth mention a
"Sanitatsdiesnstgrad" ( abbreviated , and iierewithunder referred'^
to as ,SM ; sort of Medical Orderly ) who was the "Blockftthrer"
of the wSanitSts-*Baraake,, (Hut for Convaleseent People so-called
"Sohonungs-Block",an annexe to the Camp's Infirmary ,Block 15) ,
and. who seived as an SBC there .
neither of the deponents can have meant the accused SCHMITT ,
for the following reasons :
ME PRESIDENT 1
( Herr Prdsident!)
YOUR HONOURS ! _
( Hohe Richter !)
J The accused SCHMITT is 59 years of age .He is a married man.
1 He has been what 'we call "an old African",i.e., a man who'
served in the formef German Colonial Forcq • " Only the best
and the most decent men"were'selected for serving in the
Colonial Force .
The years of colonial service in Africa have marked their traces
on the face of the accused ./o' The wants and the spiritual
distress of a^long period of detention during the last^time
.^have added theirs on his features .	.	*
' I respectfully beg Your-Honours to see that , to appreciate it,
and not to mistake the appearance of the accused that may seem
somwwhat unkeimt at first sight . c j	<
Once you have nad a thorough look into the accused person's eyes
you will have realised that SCHMITTxis a^kind and soft-hearted
a. man,^ aiman who simply cannot have been ^able to treat ,his fellow-
men roughly or brutally, and who has never been able to commit
the .offences he is being charged with today .
_ This I do not allege thinking it «a»-my duty., as his; defending
counsel , to do my client Saturn, but I say it because it Is my
oonvictiop, deeply rooted in my mind ,.that SCHMITT is completely
, and that he has NOT committed the offenees he is be-
ing accused of .	_	(	t
﻿v ; According to the deposit of Wladislaw Byrski the instruc-
tions given hy th^t SBG "who was 'the "Biockfuhrsr" in the In-
firmary Hut (Block 15) to the hut orderlies Was off the "sort tte-
tha't the orderlies were to get the sick prisoners out to roll
call hy any means ( wooden clubs, killing ) .	”	" L
By. the examination of the Witnesses HEIDEMAM and OTTE as well
as by the examination under oath of the accused himself1 .
-2-
M
i S
(a)	SCHMITT was NOT an SDG . This has been fully proved by his
' pay^bbbk produced to “the Court . Had he been an SBC, there'
would have been an entry to that effect in his pay-book,at any
rate . There is no such entry . He is merely hlassed as "Eotten-
•fUhrer”.	• .	1 ■ ■
(b)	SCHMITT himself , as witness under oath, as well as the
witnesses HEIDEMAITN and OTTE , s^her of them under oath, too,
confirmed that the accused was NOT an SBC, thtat he never was on
duty in that infirmary hut (Block 15) , and that he simply could
not have been on duty there , as there were only SBG^s employed
there .
(c)	Ejbtjrgr of the witnesses HEIBEMANN and OTTE stated, indepen-
dently from one another, that just in that infirmary hut
^(Block 15) there was on.duty an SBC similar to SCHMITT in age and
appearance .	, j .
To-this point I respectfully beg to stress that I asked the wit-
'nesses about this coincidence merely on a suggestion of ME PHE-
ISIDENT, and I whish to confirm hereby, as is my duty, that I did
not discuss this point with the two .witnesses before trial was on.
Since either of the witmesses independently and in absence, of either
made this statement, viz., that there was ion duty in that in-
firmary hut an SBC resembling td ,the accused SCHMITT , it must
be taken for granted that their statement is correct .
So it seems Xo me justified to suppose that the deponents Wladis*
law Byrski and Samuel Curt , when being shown that photo No 40/
Z/5/10 , were sureote mean that SBC who resembled the hocused
SCHMITT .	. '	_	...... 1 Z-
There must have been, i submit, a mistake .of the accused for that
SBC the deponents had in mind .	'.
(a)﻿(whose statements to this point have been fully confirmed hy
those of the witness OTTE ), it has become evident
that the accused , at the place where he himself was on "Block-
ftihrernduty, did not give, nor possibly camsert have given, in**
structions of that .sirt . t	^ t
5?he d^ty of the accused as a Blockftihrer in the Men's Canape was
to help thev "EapportfUhrer" (his superior, in charge of the roll'
callX count the strength , The BlockfUhrer was not responsible
himself for the roll call . The "Rapport fuhrerf alone was re-
sponsible for that . It was not the Blockfiihrer' s .business to
mind whether,e.g. , out of a number of JOO inmates all^ the 300
c^rne out to fall in at the roll call, or only 250 or so .If
there fell in onlyj 25£) , this strength was reported to the
commandant . It was not the Blockfuhrer's concern,anyhow , to
bother about the remaining 50 • ,	^	^
It is exactly this point that has become, evident from the pro-
secutor's cross-examining the accused and the witnesses ,who
confirmed it oPfe&ey of them independently .
<, J - 1 u
(e)	The witness HEIDSiAhh was in BELSEN only until February
23 rd,1945, it is true . For the period prior to this
date, however, he confirmed what I have mentioned above .
There is not the'' slightest .reason left, I submit, to suppose
‘that the accused was employed as an SDG to~ Block 15 after
February 23 rd, 1945 The statement by OTTE, and the paying- -
book of the' accused as well,' would "speak against such suppo-
sition .	* f	v
(f)	Oh the other hand, there is strong evidence in favour of
^ v' the accused in the deposit °of Eva WEISS ^(Exhibit 377) «
She states that she often saw the accused in BELSEN, and that
she never saw him beat anybody . ^	^	J
If the accused were "that man the deponents Wladislaw Byrski ,
Samuel Curt, and JesiaSilberberg had in mind , the deponent
Eva WEISS who saw the accused often", could not but have seen
him beat somebody' dr other , for Byrski and Samuel Curt have
stressed the fact that the man'they had in mind was one of the
worst guards lin the camp . That man very often-beat people with
a wooded stick, a shovel, etc .
It seems to me that just this deposit of Eva WEISS proves that﻿the deponents Wladislaw Byrski,“ Samuel Curt , 'and Jesi
berg cannot have meant the accused hy their statements
ig; From the pay-hook of the accused retw!t»ts that from
3 rd, 1945 to February 24 th, 1945- he was not in BE;
but stayed in a hospital, nnd that from February 24 th
March 3 rd,45 he was not, in BEESEN CAMP either, but m
So the period between February 3 rd,45 and March 3 rd,'
set aside .
I admit there is still left the period between March 3
15 th,45 during which offence might havec.bee^ committe
accused , but the supposition of a mistake of the perse
the same supported at least by the fact that the accuse
been present at all- in cam£ during the period between I
3 rd and March 3 rd, 1945 . ■
(h) Apart from his duties as nBlockfuhrer” ai roll call
as has become evident, never took alone ., and wherl
entered a hut,) SCHMITT was in charge of the telephone
He cannot possibly be suspected of having committed any
while on telephone duties , as^he would sit alone in th
and had no contact whatsoever with inmates there
The same, applies to the time while he was ,	Ma
45 employed as an doorkeeper ( as he stated as witness
As a doorkeeper he would stand near the camp-entrance g,
could jaot possibly ill-treat at the same time, prison*
infirmary or at road building commandos ■
>
II* To UP m7 arguments to those points of the char^
, ^ based upon the deposits of Byrski and Samule Curt
I am fplly convinced it has become evident , from what ]
tioned just now , that the accused is NOT ^the criminal
at any rate there must have been a mistake of the accuse
SBC. who wast then acting as a BlockfOhrer in Block 15,Ini
This has become evident , I repeat< from the statements
nesses and, first of all, from the payisg—book, an offa
ment proving beyond doubts that the accused had not beer

III«. There is. a Tast point of the charge left for me to discuss,
viz., the statement of Jesia SILBEEBERG •
I should like to say this :	1 '
(a) The deponent SILBEBBEHG, when being shown photo No 40 , did
- NOT know the name "SCHMITT% So it might well be presumed
that,like the deponents Byrski and Samuel Curt, she recognized
on the photo that SM t resembling SCHMITT, who was on duty iff
the infirmary hut ( Block 15 ) .

(b) The deponent has stated that that man whom she recognized on
photo No 40 was in charge of a road building commando . .
This again shows(that there must be a mistake of the person ,
for thee accused has never been in charge of a road building
commando •	.-v	j tx w^	XX/
There is another fact I. should beg the Court to consider ;
If the accused,had been that man Jesia, SIIBERGERG regpgnized on
photo No 40 , there would no doubt have been ready lots of wit-
vnesses to declare they knew him for one of the worst guards ,
; who beat people, very often , and very ferociously .
Now, the witness WEISS, who^ saw the accused in BELSEN at many
times , confirms, on the contrary, that she never saw him beat
anybody . This , too, I should think, will prove that the accused
was NOT the man meant by "the deponent * who pretends to have wit-
nessed on many occasions that brutal beating with th^at long
and heavy stick .
(c) Besides, I beg leave to say that the deponent SIL BEEBERG
does not seem to me what I would call a particularly reliable
witness. She says the guard she had in mind used for his beatings
a w.ooden .stick .about 1 and 1/2 metres long , and of the thick-
ness-of a man’s arm . Imagining such club, you will easily see
how terribly exaggerated this statement of hers is •
Your Honours will kindly remember that I produced before the Court
a somewhat similar stick , not quite 1 and 1/2 metres long , and
not quite as thick as a man’s arm .	^ :v .
Everybody will easily be convinced 'that the sworn statement of-
Jesia SIIBERBERG must have been frightfully exaggerated at least
to this point , since such instrument would have been far too un-
handy, too long,and too heavy to be used in the manner described
by the deponent .	‘	•﻿.7 ' T- ' '	' IfeTtiiisjoint
Now, if the*deponent did not tell the truth/as distinctly as she
ought to have done , can she expect anyone - not"to mention Your
^Honours ^ to give credit to the. rest of her statements ? ,
It seems-to be obvious that she will not have stuck, to the truth
1 then, either-; and that a statement one point of which-evidently
' has not been correct, should be considered of little value al^-
to_gether .	♦ v	- , 7 •	i1 , o
- Being obliged , as defending counsel, to do whatever I can
for ■ the Recused , I still have- to declare that-my-reSponsibihty
bids me mention, at last, that I have not had the chance of
cross-emimining the witnesses for the prosecutiop I hdd, in
fact,- asked to summon them . But -summoning them turned out' to be
impossible	,,e	. u. -x J t -I-	o-p.; . ‘V’,,

served in the formed German Colonial Force • Only the best

the offences he is being charged with today .
This I do not allege thinking it -was-my duty , as his defending
yrlu n%wi' tA \
counsel , to do my client a turn, but I say it because it is my
conviction, deeply rooted in my mind , that SCHMITT is completely
Nfe-fcOrbrY , and that he has NOT committed the offences he is be-
ing accused of .7
The deponents Wladislaw Byrski and Samuel Curt both mention a
*Sanitatsdiesnstgrad" ( abbreviated , and herewithunder referred
to as .SPG ; sort of Medical Orderly ) who was the "BlookfUhrer'
of the *Sanitats-Barhcke"(Hut for Convalescent People ,so-called
"Sohonungs-Blook",an annexe to the Camp’s Infirmary ,Block 15) ,
and who served as an SPG there .
Neither of the deponents can have meant the accused SCHMITT ,
for the following reasons :﻿v ' Acoixding to tiie deposit of Wladialav. Byrski the instruc-
tions given by tiiat SDii who was the ,,BXobkfUhrar,, in the Xn-
finaery Bbit (Block i$) to the hut orderlies ' was of the sort tie-
that the orderlies were to get the sioh prisoners out to roll

pay-hook produced to the Court . Had he been an SBC, there
would have been an entry to that effect in his pay-book, at any
rate . There is no Such entry . He is merely classed as "Hotten-

(b)	SCHMITT himself as witness under oath, as well as the

III. there Is a last point of the charge left for me to Alecoas,
f ▼!*.« tue statement of Jeeia SILBJHBMG .
f shbiiid''like to say thio'f	—*
(a)	the deponent SliiBlLEBIM, when being shown photo So 40 , did
HOT know the name ^ SOHMITT". So It might well be presumed
that,like the deponents Byreki and Samuel Curt, she recognized
on the photo that SPG , resembling SCHMITT, who v,as on duty in
the infirmary hut ( BIoojs: 15 ) .
(b)	The deponent has stated that that pan whoa see recognised on
photo Ho 40 was in charge of a ropd building commando .
this again shows that there must be a mistake of the person ,
for thee accused has newer been in charge of a rood building
commando • j[ ' * ~ ^	/*** i fw-f	----j
There is another fact I should beg the Court to consider :
If the accused had been that man Jesia SIIBBEGBEO regognize 1 on
photo Ho 40 , there would no doubt have been ready lota of wit-
nesses to declare they knew him for one of the worst guards ,
who beat people very often , and very ferociously .
Now, the witness WEISS, who saw the accused in BELSEN at many
times , confirms, on the contrary, that she never saw him beat
anybody . This , too, I should thina., will prove that the accused
was NOT the man meant by the deponent who pretends to have wit-
nessed on many oeoaaioas that brutal beating with thjat long
and heavy stick .
(c)	Besides, I beg leave to say that the deponent 3IL BuKBEEO
does not seem to m© what I would oall a particularly reliable
witness. She says the guard she had in mind used for his beatings
a wooden stick about 1 and 1/2 metres long , end of the thick-
ness of a man’s ana . Imagining such, olub, you will easily see
how terribly exaggerated this statement of hers is .
Your Honours will kindly remember that I produced before the Court
a somewhat similar stick , not ^uite 1 and 1/2 metres long , and
not ^uite as thick as a man’s arm .
Everybody will easily be convinced that the sworn statement of
Jesia SUBIEBiBS must have been frightfully exaggerated at least
to this point , since such instrument would have been far too un-
handy, too long, and too heavy to be used in tne manner described
by the deponent •
(46﻿-6-

»• -j
to this point
How, if th* 4«yon*nt did not t*ll the truth/as distinctly as she
ougrrt to have done , can she expect anyone - not to mention Your
Honours — to give credit to the rest of her statements ?
It seems to be obvious that she will not have stuck to the truth
tiien, either, and that a statement one point of which evidently
has not been correct, should be considered of little value al»
to-gether .
IV .
Being obliged , as defending counsel, to do whatever I can
for the tccusfl , ,1 still have to, declare that my responsibility
bids me mention, at Xaist,' that 1 have not had th© ohanee of
cross-examining the withesses for the prosecution • I had, in
fact, asked to summon them . But summoning them turned Out to be
impossible .
V. In Conclusion, and considering all these points I have been
setting forth to the Court ,
I very respectfully ask
to declare the accused &CIMITT

Duroh Upteil eines Militargerichta vom 29. Mai 1946 in Celle ist
der Karl S e h m 1 t - t t z-Zt. im Zuchthaus in Hameln Nr.762/47 we-
gen Begehung eines Kriegsverbrechena zu 15 Jahren Gefangnis verur-
teilt worden.
Ich habe ihn in jenem. Verfahren verteidigt. Meine tiberzeugungj daas

Ich bitte um Naohprtifung.
In der Anlage tiberreiche ich meipe Verteidigungsschrift und meine
^Hechtsmitteischrift aus Jenem ^erfahren in englischer und deutecher
:&prache,
Es ijat danach ganz deutlich, dass der hier verurteilte Karl Schmitt
nicht derselbe ist, den d^e Zeu&en gemeint haben und dass das Urteil
einen vbllig Unschuldigen getroffen hat. Ich bitte hbfliohst, nicht
ausser acht zu lassen, dass die Zeugen nicht persdnlich in der Ver-
handlung zugegen gewesen sind, dass also die Mdglichkeit ftiner Gegen-
iibers'tellung und eines Wiedererkennens sowie die MSglichkeit eines
Kreuzverhbrs nicht bestanden haben. Der Verurteilte muss jetzt etwa
66 Jahre alt sein.

Gelle, den 8. Jiani I946
Staf* Captain "A"
129; Brigade
1*) I, -Karl S e h ra i t t , hereby petition against theJfinding
and sentence" of a Military'" Court held on the 29 th of May I946 at
Celle which found meguiltiy of committing a war crimw in that
VJ at Belsen and elsewhere between January'1943 and April 1945, when
a member-of the'Concentration Chmp staff, in violation;of the laws
and usages of war^ was concerned in the ill-treatment and killing of
Allied. Nationals interned therein with the exception of the killing
andjsentenced me to imprisonment 15 years.	( t
2*) The grounds of my petition, aa*; iiave -been drawn upon my behalf,
; by my defending ■counsel, a.r« the followingi ^	-
Schmitt has been charged not with having killed a person, but merely
with having been concerned in ill-tr Yatment ."The stsfements against
him have been made -by; the witnesses. Byrski and Curt » .
Both witnesses mention a '"Sanitatsdienstgrad" ( SDG, me'dical order-
ly) , who was on duty in the "Sanitatsbaracke"(Infirmary Hut”)
_Block 15) , #nd there committed actions of ill-treatment .
The accused Schmitt cannot have been this person u He was not an
SIXi, nor wae he ever on duty-in the Infirmary Hut ( Block 15) •
This was stated by the witnesses Otte and.Heidemann, independently
j from each other v „ ^ '1 .	_,;e0 bo .	oE .	.	‘
0 I^thermore it has becomie evident from the entry in his paybook,
which Is an official document, that he was not an "SDG", but a "Kott
ftihrer,tf. -The witnese Weiss, who saw: the accused7 at Belsen often ,
e jconfirmeicL tji&t she. had never seen him beating anybody, i:£%s this wit-
ness-saw Schmitt at many times, she could not have but seed him beat
_ oingiinmates, since the man described by the witnesses Curt & Byrski
■ S*- vl-Jt ••	V	> VvE ■
"was ortevof the worst guards who T3eat- people’ very often and very vio-
.tilenifely. How, there was , in fact, in that Infirmary Hut, Block 15,
y an SBG who much resembled Schmitt not only in age , but also in
appearance .	.	x..	,	...
There is another "fact that speaks in Schmitt's favour, viz., that,
according to the entry, in his paybook
, Schmitt did not, stay in c﻿-2-
, X-	•	x,x:r •	• ‘
during the period .between Feb 45 and 5 March £5 > because he was in
hospital , and then on leave . So, for this period, any supposition
of his having been the criminal must be eliminated altogether .
I most respectfully ask to consider that, under such circumstances,
there is very much reason indeed to presume that Byrski's and Curt's
statements have obviously been based upon a mistake ofi their part of
Schmidt for another person , viz., the 3SDG resembling him .
There is even more reason, I should think, since Schmitt himself,
when examined as a witness, declared under oath that never in his life
was he on duty in Infirmary Hut Block 15, nor was there at all any
time .	'
I furthermore beg to take into consideration the fact that(there was
no chance of confronting with the accused the witnesses T who have
have charged him to be the criminal from mere looking at a photo ,
of cross-examining them, and, quite particularly, of putting the que-
stion before them ,’ if they indeed recognized the accused as that man
:whom they had charged in their deposits..
The statement of the witness Silberberg, too, evidently has been based
upon a confusion of t6.e person . In this case there was no chance
of confronting and cross-examining, either i This witness, too,
had made her deposition against the accused merely after recognizing
a person from a photo , without there.having been a chance of con-
firmimg , before the-Court ,Jand in front of the accused, that he was
indeed the man she was going to charge .
The mah (the( witness does charge was on duty with a road-building
.c'ommand \ Schmitt, however, has never been in charge of such a command
as was confirmed by the witnesses OtHse and Schmitt under oath .
I should like to emphasize that the deponent Silberberg has not been
a reliable witness , According to what she- stated , that guard she
had in mind, regularly used . fqr his beating a wooden stiojk 11/2
long, and as thick as a man's arm . This, statement certainly is great-
ly exaggerated . Such wooden stick would be far -too heavy and too
junhandy for regularJy using it to beat people .	.^
Myy T , in-conclusion, repeat what I set forth in my defence-paper
of 25 May .46.
\Since._I am,.,, definitely and truely, convinced that pphmitt is NOT
guilty., and personally spoken, even, consider him to be a kind-hearted
man who would do no harm -, not even to animals, the less -to men,
I very respectfully ask to consider , on review,- my opinion- that
evidence beyond doubt against Schmitt has not teen demonstrated by
the trial .	,
x •	-	J t, -	_
With regard to the^e circumstances a complete acquittal of Schmitt
would not only be most highly appreciated' "as a fuily satisfying
'sentence,'-but would fill- me with, particular admiration and -the
highest respect to such a way of decision • i L

xSih&i .• 2.'>	-﻿Dem Angeklagten Schmitt wird nicht Totung, sondsrn nur Miss-
handlung zur Last gelegt. Belastet wird er von den Zeugen Curt
und Byrski. Beide Zeugen sprechen von einem Sanitatsdienst^ad,
der in der Sanitatsbaracke (Block 15) Dienst getan hat und sich
dort der Mlsshandlungen schuldig gemacht hat.
Der Angeklagte Schmitt kann das nicht gewesen sein* er war nicht
Sanitatsdienstgrad und hat in der Sanitatsbaracke (Block 15) nie-
mals Dienst getan. Das haben die Zeugen Otte und Heidemann, unab-
hangig voneinander, ausgesagt. Welter weist das Soldbuch des Ange-.
klagten als offentliche Urkunde aus, dass er nicht Sanitatsdienst-
grad, sondern Rottenfiihrer gewesen ist. Die Zeugin Weiss, die den
Angeklagten in Belsen haufig gesehen hat, bestatigt, dass sie ihn
niemals irgend jemanden hat schlagen sehen. Da diese Zeugi^chmitt
haufig gesehen hat, hatte sie ihn auch unbedingt beim Schlagen von
Haftlingen sehen mussen, denn derjenige Mann, den die Zeugen Curt
uiid Byrski schildern, ist einer der schlimmsten Wachter gewesen,
der sehr oft und sehr wild auf die Leute einschlug. In der Revier-
baracke ( Block Ip) hat es aber einen Sanitatsdienstgrad gegeben,
dem Schmitt nicht nur, ah Alter, sondern auch im Aussehen sehr ahn-
lich gewesen 1st. Zu Schmitts $unsten spricht welter die Tatsache,
dass sein Soldbuch ausweist, dass Schmitt vom 3. 2. 1945 bis zum
3. Marz 1945 nicht im Lager gewesen ist, well er im Lazarett und
auf Urlaub geweilt hat, so dass er wahrend dieser Zeit ohnehin als
Tater ausscheiden muss.
Ich bitte hoflichst, zu prtifen, .ob bei dieser Sachlage nicht-anzu-
nehmen sein sollte, dass unbedingt cine Verwechslung des Schmitt
mit einem ihm ahnlich sehenden Sanitatsdienstgrad in der Aussage de&
Zeugen Curt'und Byrski vorliegt, zumal Schmitt selber als Zeuge
unter Eid ausgesagt hat, dass er niemals in seinem Leben in der Sa-
nitatsbaracke (Block 15) Dienst getan hat,und dass er dort uberhaupt
niemals gewesen ist. Dabei*f&4eiter zu beriicksichtigen, dass keihe
Moglichkeit bestanden hat, die Zeugen, die den Angeklagten nur nadi
einer Fotografie beschuldigt haben, dem.Angeklagten gegenuberzu -
stellen, sie ins Kreuzverhor zu nehmen und insbesondere, an sie die
Frage zu richten, ob sie den Angeklagten als denjenigen Mann wieder-
erkennen, den sie in ihrer Aussage beschuldigt haben.
Auch bei der Aussage.der Zeugin Silberberg handelt.es sich qffenbar
um eme^’wechslung. Auch hier hat die Moglichkeit der Gegentiber-
stellung/aes Kreuzverhbrs gefehlt. Auch diese Zeugin hat den Ange-
klagten nur hach einer Fotografie
/﻿1
beschuldigt, ohne dass ,di« Mdglichkeit bestanden hatt«, vor
Gericht im Angesicht des Angeklagten zu bestatigen, ob der
Angeklagta der Mann, aei, den sie beschuldigen wolle.
Der Mann, den die Zeugin beschuldigt, war bei einem Strassenbau-
kommando besch&ftigt* Schmitt aber, wie der Zeuge Otte Und Sc.hmitt
selber unter Eid ausgesagt haben, ist niemals bei einem Strassen-
baukommando beschaftigt gewesen.
Hinzuweisen 1st auch darauf, dass die Zeugin Silberberg keine
zuverlassige Zeugin ist. Nach ihrer Darstellung hat der von ihr
gemeinte Wachter zum Schlagen regelmfisslg einen Holzkniippel vpn
1 1/2 m Lange und der Dicke eines Mannesarmes benutzt. Das ist
eine arge tJbertreibung* Solch ein Kolzkniippel wiirde viel zu
schwer und zu unhandlich sein, urn ihn zum Schlagen regelmassig zu
benutzen.
Ich wiederhole im ubrigen, was ich in meiner Verteidigungsschrift
vom 25. Mai 1946 gesagt habe und bitte, da nach meiner festen
Uberzeugung Schmitt vollig unschuldig 1st und ich ihn personlich
fur einen herzensguten Menschen halte, der^sinem Tier, geschweige
denn einem Menschen ein Leid antun konnte, zu berucksichtigen, dass
ein einwandfreier Beweis gegen Schmitt nicht als gefuhrt angesehen~
werden durfte.	»
Bei dieser Sachlage wlirde mich sein volliger Preispruch nicht
nur mit Genugtuung, sondern mit besonderer Hochachtung vor solcher
Ents che i dung erfiillen.

besohuldigt wird, nicht getan bat.
!• Die Zeagen Wladislaw Byraki and Samuel Curt spreohen belde
von elnem Sanitatsdienstgrad, der in der Sanltatsb&raoke (Block 15,
•Scbonungsblook", Revler) ala SanitStadlenatgrad der Blookleiter
gewesen 1st and der dort aelnen Dlenat getan bat. Belde Zeugen
ktsnnen den Angeklagten Schmitt nicht gemeint haben aus folgenden
Grtlnden:
' ■ • . . ’ - . ’ . ’■ '■ ,
a) Schmitt war nicht Sanit&tadlenstgrad. Sein, dem Gerlobt
dberrelohtes Soldbuojti beweist das mlt aller Slcberbelt. Wenn er
Sanltdtsdlenatgr&d gewesen ware, wtirde das in dem Soldbuob steben
mUsaen. Br let dort aber nar als Bottenftihrer, nicht ale Sanitate*

abMagig und in Abveaanhalt vonoinander gassacht haben, muss dlasa

Karl SCHMITT
Reference HQ 30 Corps District 336/53/4(PS) dated (-)
June 1946 forwarding the attached proceedings for niy advice.
In my opinion there is evidence to support this
conviction. Although it is not clearly set out in the
record^ of the proceedings, it has been ascertained from
the president that the court inspected the photograph referred
to by the deponents in their depositions (see exhibits ’E* &
’R') and were satisfied that it was a photograph of the
accused.
In my opinion the proceedings may be confirmed..
The accused has petitioned against finding and sentence
on the grounds of mistaken identity. I think:that the
evidence of the third defence witnes^So some extent strength-
ens the evidence of identification and I am of opinion that
the petition discloses no adequate grounds for interfering
with the conviction, If you agree, the petition should be
dismissed and the accused so informed.
If the evidence contained in the depositions of BIRSKI
and KURT be accepted in toto you will probably agree' that the
sentence awarded by the court is not excessive. ^

<Dem Angfklagten Scl&itt wird nicht Totung, aondern nur Miss-
gandlimg zur Last gelegt. Belastet wird et von den Zeuge^p. Curt
r •	’ f *
und Byrski. Beide Zeugen sprechen von einem Sanitatsdieristgrad,
der in der Sanita.tsbaracke’ (Block 15) Dienst getan hat'und sich
dort der Miss-handlungen schuldig gemacht hat. (
Der Angeklagte Schmitt kann das nicht gewesen sein. S-r war
nicht Sanitatsdiepstgrad und hat in der Sanlt&tsbaracke ( Block .
. 15) niemala. Dienst getan. Das haben die Zeugen Otte und Heidemann,,
unabhangig voneinander, ausgesagt. Weiter weist das Soldbuch des
Angeklagten ala offentliche Urkunde aus, dass er nicht Sanitats-
dienstgrad, sondern Rottenfuhrer gewesen is,t. Die. Zeugin Weiaa,
die den Angeklagten in welsen hSufig geseJjen hat, .besthtigt,
dass sie ihn niemals irgend jemanden hat sphl^gen sehen. Da dieae
’ Zeugin deu Schmitt haufig geseheri hat, hatte sie ihn auch unbe-
dingt 'be.im Schlagen von Hdftlingftn sehen mbssen, denn darjbnige
■	LNPI I:	. 'C V'-
Mamn, den die Zeugen Curt und-Byrski schildern, ist einer der
schlimmsten 7/achterJ gewesen, der sehr off und sehr wild auf die
Leute einschlug. In der Revierbaracke (Block 15) hat ea aber
einen Sanitatsdienstgrad gegeben, dem Schmitt nicht nur an Alter,
sondern auch im Aussehen sehr ahnlich gewesen ist. Zu Schmitts
Gunsten spricht weiter die Tatsa.che, dass-sein Soldbuch auaweist, .
dass 'Schmitt vom 3.^.1945 kis zum 3. Marz 1945 nicht im Lager
gewesen isf, weil er im Lazarett auf TJrlaub'getyeilt hat, so daas
er wahrend dieser Zeit ohnahin ala Ta'ter auascheiden muss.
Ich bitte hdflichst, zu prufen, ob bei dieser Sachlage nicht an- .
zunehmen sein sollte, dass unbedingt elne Verwechslung dea
Schmitt mit einem ihm ahnlich sehenden Sanitatsdienstgrad in der
Aussage der Zeugen Curt und Byrski vorliegf, zuraal Schmitt aelter
als Zeuge unter Eid ausgesagt hat, dass er niemals in seinem
' s’	\	0	0	#	.	. V *0	-	0 C D O U -
Leben ’in der 'Sanitatsbaracke (Block 15) Dienst getan hat, und daas
er dort iiberhaupt niemals gewesen ist. Dabei bi^te ich weiter zu
berucksichtigen, dass keine.Mdglichkeitvbestanden hat, die Zeugen,
die den Angeklagten nur nach einer Fotographie bewschuldigt haben,
dem Angeklagten (gegeniiberzusteilen, sie ins Kreuzverhpr zu nehmen,
und iiiebesondere an sie die Frage zu richten, ob sie den Angeklagten|
als denjenigen Mann wiedererkennen, den sie in ihrer Aussage be-
schuldigt 'haben.'' ’	-	■	'•	■
Auch bei der Aussage der Zeugin Silberberg handelt es sich offen-
bar urn eine Verwechslung. Auch hier hat die Mdglichkeit der Gegen- |
• - ' '	' ./.'' V﻿Der Yert?*!,
Hschtsanwalt
uberstellung uad des KreuzverhSrs gefehlt. Audi’ dic;se Zeugin. ,
hat den Angeklagten. nur nach einer .Fotografie heschuldigt,
ahne dass .die Moglichkeit bestanden Mtte, vor Gericht in^Ange-
aicht des Angeklagten zu bestatigen, ob 'der Angeklagte der Mann
sei, den sie beschuldigejn wolle. ,	•	1	. '
Der Mann, den die Zeugin bes'ehuldigt, war hex einetu Strassenbau-*
koramando beschaftigt. Schniitt aber, wie der Z.euge Otte und Schmitt
aelber uhter Eid ausgesagt haben, ist nienala bei einem Strasseh- ,
baukoramando becchaftigt. gewesen.	"	y*	^
Hinzuweisen ist auch darauf, dass" die Zeugin Silberberg keine zu-
Yerlassige Zeugin ist. N&ch ihrer Dhrstellung hat'der von ihr ge--
meinte Mchter zuni Schlagen regelmassig einen Holzknhppel von 1 1/2
m Lfinge und der Dicke eines Mannesarnies benutztl Das ist.eine arge
tjberteibung. Solch .sin Holzkm'ippel wiirde viel zu schwer und zu un-
handlich sein, um ihn zum Schlagen'regelmassig zu benutzen.
Ich wisdsrhole im iibrigen, was ich in meiher Yerteidigungsschrift
■,vom 25. Mai 1946 _gesagt habe und bitte, da nach meiner festen .
tlberzeugung"Schmitt vollig unschuldig ist und ich ihn personlich
.'i*ur eluen herzensguten Menschen halts, der keinem Tier, tgeschweige
denn einem .Menschen ein Leid antun kpnnte, -zu berticksichtigen,
dass ein einwandfreier Bewsls pegen Schmidt nicht als gefuhrt•ange-
j • •	f •	„
'sshen warden durfte.
i’-0 ■ <	•	-	- c
Bei dieser Sachlage iVtird^ ra.ich sein Vfdlliger Freispruch nicht nur
mit Genugtuung, .spndern mit besonderer JHochachtung vor solcher
Ent'scheidung erf.ullen, '	/ ■ i﻿£.) Tlip grotirids of my pattition, as have been drawn up, on
my behalf/ by my defending counsel, are the following;
Schmitt has been charged not with having killed a person, but
merely v/ith having been-concerned in ill-treatment. The state-
me.nts against him have been ma^e by the witnesses Byrski and.
; Curt ..	. _ ■	' , '	' ; v '
Bpth witnesses mention,a "Sanii^tahienstgrad” (SDG, medical
orderly), who was on duty in the "Sanitatsbaracke" (Infirmary
Hut11) Block 15) and there comitted actions of ill-treatment. ^
The accused Schmitt cannot have been'this person. He was not an
SGD, nor was he ever on duty in the Infirmary Hut (Block 15).
.	..	,	•' v	'	.
This was.stated by the witnesses Otte arid Pieidemann, independently
from each other.	:	c'
Furthermorei it has become evident from the entry in his Paybook,
which is an.aofficial document, that he was not an’"SGD", bub a
"Eottenfuhrer”. The,witness. Weiss, who-saw.the accused at Belsen
often, confirmed that, she had never seen him beating anybody.
^.t this witness .saw^ Schmitt at many times, she cut npt^have but
seen him beating inraates, since the man described by the wit-
nesses Curt and Byrski was.one of the worst guards who beat people
very often and very violently. How, there was, in fact,"in that
Infirmary Hut, Block 15, an SGD who much resembled Schmitt not
only in. age, but also^in appearance.' ■ .
There is anotherlfact that speaks in Schmitt?s favour, viz..
that, according to»the entfy in his paybook, .Schmitt -did not
stay in camp, during the period between 3 Feb 45. and'3 March 45,
/
because he was in hospital, and than on'l.eaveT~S©7"To^this'
period, any supposition of his having been the criminal must be
eliminated alltogethef.	.1 1 1	. 1 .
I most respectfully ask to' consider that, under such circumstances,
■ there is very much reason indeed to presume that-^yrski’s and
Curts * statements hav^~obvious!^ been based upon a mistake on their
part of Schmitt for another personj^Jvoz., the SDG hese mb ling - him.'
There is "even more"reason, f should.think, since Schmitt himself,
when examined as a»Witnesses, declared under oath that never in his
life was he on duty in Infirmary Hut Block 15, nor was. there at '
any time. .	I	.
I furthermore beg -to take into consideration, the fact that
there was no change of confronting with the accused the wit-
nesses - who have charged him to be the criminal from 'mere﻿looking at a photo, of cross-examining theta* and quite -paijtl- '
• <	^	c '•	^	•,	•
cuiarly* of putting the question before^them, if they indeed
recognices the accused as that man whom"they had charged in
<thelf deposits. L rf.'l’/: ]ry 1	'
The statement of the witness Silberherg, to#, evidently has
been based upon a confusion of the person. In this case there
was no chance of, confronting and cross-examining, either. This
< — r •	.	r ' - J	T5».-
witness, too, had made her deposition against the a cused merely
after recognioing a person from a photo, withofit there having
been a change of confirming, before the bourt, and in frqnt of
the accused, that he was indeed the man she was going to charge.
’ • ) •’ • ' .
c
The man the witness.,.does charge was on duty with a road building
command. Schmitt, however, has never been in.charge of such a
command as was confirmed ba the witness Q'tte and Schmitt under
oath.	!	,
I should like 'emphasice that the deponent Silberberg has not
been a reliable witness, according to.was she stated, that guard
she had in mind regularly used for his beating a wooden stick
1 1/2 long, and aS thick as a mants arm. ’rjiis1 statement certainly
is greatly exaggerated. Such wooden stick would be far too
heavy and to unhandly for regularly using it to beat people.
fey I, in'conclusion, repeat what I set forth in rry defence-
paper of 25 May 4-6*	'
Since I amj definitely and truly, convinced that Schmitt is not
guiltly and personally spoken, even consider him tp be a kind*
hearted man who would do no harm, not even to animals/ the less
to men, I vera respektfully aak to consider, on review, my
opinion that evidence beyond doubt against Schmift hat nbt been
demonstrated by the trial.	.	\
With regard to(these circumstances,,a complete acquittal of
Schmitt would not only be most highly appreciated as a fully
satisfying sentence, but'would fill me with particular admiration
and the highest/respect to ‘such a way of decision.

sacupaticn is ladies hairdresser* and housewife, I am @f polish
nati®nality and ©f Jewish origin, I belong te the Jewish faith,
1,	In October 1942* I was dSrefcted. t® a werlc camp by the Germans,
Fram there I came t© AnS0Hf/I!T2 in July 1944 and frem there I came t®
BELSEN in January 1945«
2.	I remember the following incident that came to' pass, at approximate]
the end of February ©r beginning ®f March 1945 in the camp at BELSEN*
and which I witnesses; personally. I atssd with several women at the
wind©v in my Bl ock 2:145 and saw that a ysung girl approximately 22 years
eld running past* net very far fram my window. An BS officer whom I
knew by the name ©f curt MEIER rad after her and shouted te her t» stop,,
MEYER carried a cudgel approximately 5 cm. thick and $Q cm, long, as he
always did. The girl stepped* MEYER caught held of her and found
potatoes which she had hidden under he dreaa near her basenu
3« MEYER thereupon pulled up her dress and tssic ®ff her underwear* pul
the girl aver his knee and beat her ©it her naked posterior with his
stick for approximately a quarter of an hour. MEYER was carried away
by sadistic ecstasy and continued t®> beat the girl until she lay
unconscious on the ground. Thereupon he stamped on her as well. Ther
he went away. The girl lay on the ground unconscious.
4» Approximately 20 minutes later* three Jewish women came and carries
the girl still in an ftnoonscioua state and task hep te her block. One
of the women I recognised as Eva .KRAUSE. It was impassible ta carry
the girl away any earlier as the women had t® wait first until MEYER was
far away from the spot.
5.	Eva KRAUSE told me two days later that the girl had died as a
result ©f the beating. I do not know the name of the girl* I only knout
that she was a Jewess,* that she ware the emblem laid down for Jews.* that
she was strong* approximately 1,6 metres high* dark haired, and I d@ nei
knew where she came from.
6,	On the phetograph shewn te me I recsgnise METER was the man whs?
beat her,
7„ Approximately a week later MEIER came t@ my bleck 214* which was, at
hospital blsck. I was there as a nurse. It was ferbidden ta qa,sk in
the block, but heating was allowed. MEIER interpreted these instruct^
ions that heating was also forbidden. He came at this time because he
saw smoke in the chimney. A woman st&sd in front ®f the desr and
warned us that MEIER waa ceming with his stick. ffe fled through a
window after we had speedily extinguished the fire.
8. When we came back we were told by the patients that MEIER in a fit
of temper had beaten without discrimination, the sich women in their
beds. Meat of the women had blue spats, on their backs, on their arms.,
or whare=>ever they had been beaten. I personally aaw these spots.
There were n® serious injuries, as MEYER was unable te hit directly with
his full strength because the beds were in three tiers and very near
tagether. The nationalities of these women were varied, the majority
were Jewessies, some, however were. Russians, Pales, Frenchwomen* Germans*
Jugoslavs and Hungarians.

I am Robert yEEK3AUEEBM, Belgian eitiaen born at MCXJSCRCN, the 26tYk> De&emh&t
1921 attache to the Minister of Labour' and of the Prevoyanoe Socdale.
I was prisoner at BELSSf sinoe the month of January 11345 until 15 April 1i945,
■late of the liberation of the oamp» I knew at the camp the HauptsturmfUehrer
MffiTIJRj, Kurt, who was guard officer in the oamp«,
He often visited the oamp and nearly always carried a baton in his hand, with
which he struck the prisoners back and forthc
I remember the following imidents
,sOne day dusking the winter 1944 “■ 45 they were taking the roll call, during
whioh they discovered that there were too many prisoners. The SS supposed that
it was women prisoners who had come to the men’s caE5> aol were hiding amongst
them. We were ordered to expose the people but there were many prisoners who
did not understand German and at the time when they had to dome before MATER
who was in charge of the group of Germans they had not carried out the order;
at that moment MASTER started to brutally strike the prisoners who were not
sufficiently quick according to him, and even struck the party of several
prisoners who fell and died several days after”,,
Amongst the victims I know three prisoners who were in ny block; one
Butahman and two Poles who died as a result of these blows, I do not know ary-
longer the names of these viotims because in the aamp we had only numbers.
Myself I was beaten by MATER that day and although 1 had obeyed the order,
knowing German very well at that time® I received two or three blows on the
back from the truncheon that he carried in his hand,
MATER was a well known brute and every time the prisoner's saw him arrive
at the carp they hid saying amongst themselves: “lie will take two or three for
his seior-e”,
I still remember the day when he made us work from morning till late evening
evacuating the dead of block 15 under the pretext that he had a gauleiter who
was going to visit the camp®, Every time there were prisoners who did not get,
up quickly enough they received kicks from MATER and the other SS men who were
with him®

before J.G, GROSS, Civ, Inv, Officer. No 1 Team, S'ield

Curt M,Y is irf orme<i that he is n t bouoi to answer any
Questions but that anything he says wial oe taken don in
writ! g and my be used in evidenoe,
I am Ourt MISTER* bo n on the 17th May 189:; i MMOTliR,
+1 am a German, single, official of the savi gs-bank by
profession,
U til 913 I attended the Bis.-n rok-school in ILi iCV.-2\
and 1 13 I joined the savings-bank as apprentice official.
There I was employed until r1940. In April 1940 I was called
up into the Inf&try Ersatz Batallion 194. As a eonse pienae s
of UK-Sf^llung (infcerpr, remai'ks he was needed jy the bank)
I was reeraployed with the savings-bank from July 1940 until
August 1941 • From the 1st Septe,ber 1941 until Fe rjjiary
1944 I was in the La desschuetzenbatallion 375 in the bast
(Ukraine). On the 2 Feb. 9-44 I was admitted to the :«ser»»-
hospital with severs heart-muscle trouble. On the 15 Feb,
I was sent t the Ersatz tutaiiloa as being unfit for
the f out. From there I wa s sent to HA..1, OVER where 1 waited
for my release. I was in the Landessohuetzen-bataillon
710 in HBHNOFfi® until June 1944. During ny stay in HAW" OVER
I was told that I wouli be posted to NORWAY. But I was not
posted to Norway because of medical objeoti . In June I was
told that I was call©- up into the bafien £S for service.
Until today I have never had any connection with any political
p rty. I was neither a raemb r of the N8MF nor the Allg medna
SS. As I was not protected by HS officers I was c lied up
.it- the Waffen SS when the war was ao ut to to lost, becau e
they did not want to give ofi ic rf,who were members of the
Party or the SS such an unpleasant oalliog-up. In June 1944
I was sent to the Aufenthaltslager B.JKS4N UEISS.
After July my job consisted of building infantry- ositions
in the vicinity of the camp, As I had been formerly
Bauptisanc of the Wehrraaoht ■*' was entitled to wear the e puivalent
rank in the Waffen SS, an SS Hauptstureafuehrer. I did not
k oir an Obersturmfuehrer ItilSR. I was emplojyed in this job
until ao ut Oct -b@r. % superior was Stumbannfuehrer HAAS.
Because of a visit of the Tru‘ pe'ouebungsplata-Eoi jiiancl int, Ge neral
von der Ohevallerre. I took part in a patrol thr ugh the
camp. At the entrance of* the camp th.:rs was a compound with
about 800-1000 prisomirs, whom the Komm&ndant characterized
as professional criminals, assooial and homo-sesrual. The
rest of the camp was Occupied by Jewish families, who were
kept ready to be exchanged for Germans aoroad. I had the
impression that the inter ed were in good bodily condition.
Apart from this visit I never wwnt to the compounds again,
with exception of the Lagerstrasse, which I passed iften by
car.
Aftor August new-arrivals car® to the camp. During the first
lire it contained about 1000 women who wer coming from
Warsaw wher the fighting w s at the time. In rvember the
commandants chanfed, i.e. HASS was discharged and Haupt-﻿-o -
sturmSuuhrer	was his re laceineirt. The taking-ov r
lasted until B- oember. I was at the titre air- "aid offie r.
In January 1945 I was charged with th. leading of the guard-
compan . The previous company-reader .vas JSCKJli. % {job
consisted of drill-service, detail! g of the guards and
looking after the members of the company*. The guards to re
taught the gu rd-duties by the u,* fuehrer of the company.
The work of the guards was as follows: 1) to watch the wire
fence and in cases of attempts of escape to call "Halt”
3 times to the prisoner and if he did not obgry this to shoot*
But it was pointed out in the lessons repeatedly that if
possible the escaping prisoner should be recaptured without
shooting. The Lagerkommandant was in charge of the guards
urirsg their working time, who detailed an officer on duty,
always a.; Ooerscharfuehrer, to control the guards, ard who
had to report to him in the morning, any incidet;s which
had occurred. Nothing was reported to m, as Ocsapaay-oommander.
If a guari was punished, 1 could see this from the urdch-boo&.
During my service there from June 1944 tlnitl 11 April 1945
I did not hear anything about shooting of prisoners.
I have seen that prisoners were employed: In the prisoners
clothing store and in the laundry, and were working under
superiors. I believe that the priso era liked to have
such jobs as they hoped to have some advantages therefrom.
If oases of ill-treatment have occurred the ;>».■ personnel
would not have carried it out in front of officers. Otherwise
they would h ye been punished. There was a regulation of the
SS idi.drdstration that every ill-treatment would be punishe
and that only the Reichsfuehrer S had the right to punish
prisoners. The words were as follows: "I forbid© every bodily
punishment of prisoners. Only I can promulgate punish- nts,
signed HLfcML-.fi". I neither Have witnessed any bodily punish-
raents, or heard about it. It was not my duty to control the
guards. Por this job there was a duty officer. Among others
Cbersch&rf*.ehner -uG:.' id, Oscha OBdR'MID, Hsoha PUGHS and
Uscha TAGKf were worki-.f under ms.
scha -VAG-'iSR and Oscha OBdlHAID had to control the guards and
had to report in the morning to the Lagekosuaardant. Usoha
IMiM was often detailed as guard and Uscha FOG S was employed
at the company office. The latter is here in the camp (7 GIG)
I never heard anything about executions. If those had taken
place during my service at the camp I think I would hve
heard about them.
Uuterscharfuehrer MU was in charge of the working groups,
who had to control the working-corn andos, Si® was an impulsive
character with very loud voice. I would think him quite
capable of overreaching himself. RAU did at leave the camp
with me, he probably remained there. I never met Irma. CHJ.-JS,
I have seen her photograph in the news-papers. I did not
tear anything about her.
I witnessed two searches which were unsuccessful!. The first
time it was a oo nting-mistake, ami the seeo sd time the alarm
was given too late. We went tbrought the woods together with
a search commando. The #og*s section w s detailed too, about
3 dogs. I did not witness a recapture of an escapee. I think
he would have been. cuni. hod by the Lagerkasnmard&nt on arrest.
The guard-company consisted of about 160 men. There were
about 60-80 men on guard duty every day, inclusive the 12
watch-towers, each occupied by 2 men. Tho Lagerkorariandant
was in charge of the crematorium. For convoys guards of the
company were applied for. I knew KfiAMI' iRj he appeared
quiet and distrustful to me. He only grusted the former SS
men from AUSSCHilTb. I do not believe KR&MMtSR or Dr. KL-,1
capable o: ill-treating prisoners.﻿On the 11 April 1945 £ was ordered to leave the oamr with about
200 S3 men ana to bring them to active serviceat the front
after reporting NSBENGAMMS, In the last moments before we
started o f we w re joined by 230 prisoners and a group of
2? SB prisoners. KRAMflER said th t the prisoners were Germa men,
who wer to be called up as soldiers. The arch lasted for
about 4 days. It was practioally impossible to guard them.
When we arrived in !©UE CMC®: none, of the 230 men were missing.
About half of the S3 prisoner# had escaped. Of the S@ guards
a great part, about 100 men remained on the way. I delivered
in the 230 priso ers in HSUET^GSKSSIE to the prison on demand.
The guards were accommodated in an inn in KUR LACK and they
should have .been detailed with the fighting gr up W33:R as a single
company. As there was typhoid in the company they were kept
separate. From KURRLA0K we marched to T.RITTAU and from there
to imSURQ and then to KELLI'GHAUSEH. In KETLIFGHAISE we
wer informed of the capitulation on the 2 May. There we dis-
armed the company and made a list of the SS men and handed
it in. Then, on the 17 May 1945 they wane sent to the prison
c&mo PlRuidERG. On the 23 September 1946 I came to this camp
(7 010)
That is all I save to state.

Deposition on oath of GOLDSTEIN, Mania, female, of BELSER, Canteen 4, sworn before
J.G, GROSS, Civ, Inv. Off. No. 1 Team, Field Investigation Section, W.C.G.,
at BELSM on 17 Aug. 1947.
GOLDSTEIN Mania is informed	that she	is not bound	to	answer any questions, but
that anything she says will	be taken	down in writing	and may be used in evidence.
I am Mania GOLDSTEIN, born on 26. October 1919 in VARSOW,Poland.
1 was in STARAGIOWITZE Camp, Poland, froni 1942 until July 1944, and from August
1944 until January 1945 in AUSCHkIIZ. In January 1945 1 came to BELSM into
Block 217 where I was liberated on 5 April 1945.
I recognised the photograph	of MEIER	immediately,	I	saw MEXER for the first time
in February 1945 when looking out of	the window.	My friends told me to keep
away from the window as MEIER was a very dangerous man.
He always rode through the omy on his bicycle and carried a large wooden stick
with him,
I have seen him with my own eyes catching a female prisoner who had some potatoes
on her. MEIER ordered the prisoner to take off her underclothing, then to bend
over and then MEIER beat the half naked prisoner' with his stick so hard until
she became unconscious. MEIER then drove on with his bicycle and the prisoner
remained helplessly lying there as MEIER had forbidden all other prisoners to
give any help whatsoever to the beaten girl.
MEIER always rode through camp without letting himself be seen - in order to find
out if any s oke was co ing from any of the chimneys. When noticing any smoke,
he immediately went into the Block and beat any prisoner he came across with his
stick without discrimination. Such a case also occurred in the womens* Block
217 where I was. We did some cooking for the sick and MEYER had noticed the
smoke. He came into the block i -rued lately and the prisoners who were able to
walk escaped through other doors as they knew that LtfilER beat people to death for
such masters.
That is all I can say on MEIER.

R*A* of No.l War Criaes
26tk ®f January 1946.
1.	I as: 34 year;: sf age, bora ©a 27tk December
1911 rftONI rGEJT, Bezirk Magdeburg, Seraaay. Fr@s 1921 till
1937 I was a cosaon labourer at tke sugar factory of the fire
W^ersdorf & Meeker. Pros 1937 till 1943 I wso witk tke .'ieicksbakn
at 03CHERSlj5iBlN as a packer .foreman. On 28tk August 1943 I was
drafted into tk© Araty and belonged to tke 398 St ana Koapaiai© of
tke Oronudier Ersatz battulior at GO SLA i, ay Arsty nuusber was 25^1.
I was in tke rank of "Scktitze (Rifloaan), and remained, tkere for
training for 8 or 9 weeks, and v;s 3 tken sent to T0R0JIN0 in tk*
P^ovinco of Brandonburg.
2.	Free 26tk November 1943 till tke end ©f December
1943 I was transferred to KOIfIGSBERG for an operation ©n eke eye,
as I aii cesapletely blind on tk*' right eye. At tke beginning of
January 1944 I then case t© .CHWEIINI'IZ in 'disk Upper Seliaia,
at tke end ©f January to tke Sudetenlaad, and tkon te WALBENBURG,
Palish. Upper Selesia, where 1 was witk the •andessekiitzen.
3«	At tk© beginning of February 1944 I cane t©
AUSCimiZ where I remained witk an .'.ray trainings Company till
the end of February 1945. At AUSCHWITZ I had t© orfor* guard
duties twice or tare a tines c week at BIRKEMU, which was known
t® ®9 as AUSCHWITZ II. In this oemp wor.ea, children :;ud sen were
• ccoaodated. We kad te stand on guard for - six kour-s ’.and ceuld
then kave six kaurft sleep. Ik® following-nen were with s® at
AUSCHWITZ* Untersctearfiikrer Bruno ALBRECHT, Obergefreiter MiiHLE,
rftikror NEBBE, UntersohorfUkrer Walter SCHMIDT, Ober-
gefreiter Erast GRAF, Obergefrsiter Heinrich KERR, and Untersckar-
fuhrsr Franz WIT TECH.
4.	Tne trisoaors at AUBCBTITZ were all,rery under-
‘nouridked and were starring. Judging by their locks a hundred
died drily of starvation. The people l saw there could Hardly
stand on their legs any more and were very wick. I rays elf have
seen that every day about 20 or 25 prisoners who ked collapsed
could not ri'oe again but wore lying on tk© ground and later
carried t . ■•eir rooms by other prisoners. I assume that all
tke 25 were dead on tk® following day, since no doctor looked
after these people.
5.	* * Within.tke cnap I saw 10 or 12 S3 non run
about wilk their Capos. The US men*were feinted witk carabines t-ad
revolvers and tke capos witk sticks. I witnessed every day kow
tkes® S3 Mon kit 10 t© 15 ®f the prisoners witk tkeir'” fists till
they fell, t® tk®^ground. 5 ©r 6 of these prisoners got up again
later, tke others remained lying tkere and were later put on a
heap by tk© corps® c© ms and®. Furtkemore I have seen kow every
day 20 to 30 pri .oners were shot by tke, S3 ^en witk rifles. I
kftve very often talked t® the S3 non and have asked the®, why
the prisoners had been shot, sad the aaewer I got, was taat tke
prisoners had attev. ted to escape. Many have also bean. r,k#t by
tke guard a,. without, first haying been okallanged. Many have also
been beaten t© death by tke sentries, but I cannot now remember
the rnsses ©f any ®f these sentries.
6.	In March 1945 I then accompanied a transport
©f prisoners fro® AUSCHWITZ to the concentration camp ©f BERGEN-
BELSEE as a sentry. There were man and women and,the prisoners
were loaded 80 to sack truck. The trucks were ©pen and covered
m﻿co^tiausd. SHE iOf TWO
cattle trucks, tke traia eeapesed ®f 50 trucks, witk tw® guards
to eack truck. Tke mem. of tkls transport were taken t® tk^^j^-
eentration caap BUCHEFSALD. During our stay at tke s-catioj^fc,
BUCHENWALD re were attacked by lew flying aircraft and about_L5
boobs were dreppea by 10 to 20 planes. I was riding in. one @i
tke open cattle trucks and in ay truck tkree women were killed
by a sleeper wisick kad been tkrown up into the sir by tke blast
®f ®ja.e bomb and landed in ay truck. Apart from that no-one was
injured. A further 40 prisoners were killed and two S3 mem whose
names I ’do h®t ’know.' Bombs were also dreppen in tke men’s eamp
of BUCHEMWA1D concentration camp. The dead women were left lying
in the-* trucks and taken along to BEL SEN.
Y 4	Ike j@urn.oy fr©a AUSCHWITZ t© BEHG-EN—BE13EN
took 6 to 7 days and tke train.only stopped at three stations,
and these tkree times were the oiftly occasions when the _prisoners
g@t anything to drink and were permitted to leave the trucns _i*^
order•t® relieve themseves, lain and snow which they caught during
the journey was the only other hearts of drinking they had. aaoh
prisoner was issued with a complete loaf and butter as a day’s
rati©n.
8.	We arrived at BEESEN at the end of March 1945.
Th® dead w®m®n wore collected at the station by a car and brougljj^h^
to Concentration camp BERGEN- BEL3EN Na.l. All other priioners ^
had t© march to the camp. I was then transferred to the S3 and
belonged to the guards of c@ncentra.tisB camp BERGEN- BELSEN in
rsnk ©f ScMitze.
My task was to g© to th© station at BERGEN
every morning witk 50 prisoners and t© unload rations from goods
trucks. We left camp at 8 o'clock in tke morning and worked till
6 ©’slock at night. The prisoners were ©f all nationalities. I
remember an incident, whin a prisoner had s teles, flour and_was caught
by a Cap©. The Cap® was a German from BERLIN. The Cap® hit tke
prisoner so hard, that tke prisoner fell into a ditch witk water,
end kad t© b® taken back to camp by car. I d© hot knew tke name
@f tke Cap©.
10.	On 15th April 1945 I was in Camp 1 and taken
prisoner, I have however sot feud t® assist in th© burial of tke
dead. On 21st April 1945 I caught typhus and was taken t© the
hospital at HAMBURG-!AND3BECK, where I stayed for 4 weeks. I tk^P
earn® to another hospital, the name of which I have forgottfea. From
there I was take®*to a hospital at LANGENHQRN near Hamburg and
was seat to NEUENGAMME on isth June 1945. I saw the S3 mem men-
tioned by a® in para. 3 at NEUENGAMME, all of wh©m were together

KRAUSE, Eva.
Deposition on oath of KEIAUSE, Eva, female, of BELSEN, BLOCSK. 51 Room 5> sworn
before J.G. GROSS, Giv. Inv. Off, No. 1 Team, Field Investigation Section, f/.C.G,
at BELSEN on 17 Aug. 1947.
KRAUSE Eva, is infomed that she is not bound to answer any questions but that
anything she says will be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence,
I am Eva KRAUSE, born on 20 September 1925 in RADOM, Poland.
I was in AUSCHWITZ from July 1944 until Janaury 1945. From January 1945 until
15 April I was in BELSEN.
I have recognised the photograph immediately and identified it as the one of
MEIER.
I have seen MEIER several times in the camp. My friend Mira from KRAKAU once
collected potato peels from the refuse heap next to the cook house and wanted to
take them into Block 217. METER caught MIRA and beat her with a stick and beat
her so long that he was exhausted. MIRA remained lying on the ground and after
MCTire had gone another female prisoner and I took MIRA into the Block. She had
been terribly beaten up, the colour of her skin was black, her whole face, hands
and feet were swollen and full of blood.
When we woke up on the following morning MIRA was dead in consequence of the
beating.
I wish to stress the fact that MIRA had not been beaten before and was physicially
in good health.
That is all I can say on MEIER.
(Signed) E. Krause.

DEPOSITION
of
GOLDSTEIN. Mania,
Deposition on oath of GOLDSTEIN, Mania, female, of BELSEN, Canteen 4, sworn before
J.G. GROSS, Civ. Inv. Off. No. 1 Team, Field Investigation Section, W.C.G.,
at BELSEN on 17 Aug. 1947.
GOLDSTEIN Mania is informed that she is not bound to answer any questions, but
that anything she says will be taken down in writing and may be used in evidence.
I am Mania GOLDSTEIN, born on 26. October 1919 in VARSOW,Poland.
I was in STARACH01ITZE Camp, Poland, from 1942 until July 1944, and from August
1944 until January 1945 in AUSCHWITZ. In January 1945 I came to BELSEN into
Block 217 where I was liberated on 5 April 1945.
I recognised the photograph of MEYER immediately. I saw MEYER for the first time
in February 1945 when looking out of the window. My friends told me to keep
away from the window as MEYER was a very dangerous man.
He always rode through the camp on his bicycle and carried a large wooden stick
with him.
I have seen him with my own eyes catching a female prisoner who had some potatoes
on her. MEYER ordered the prisoner to take off her underclothing, then to bend
over and then MEYER beat the half naked prisoner with his stick so hard until
she became unconscious. MEYER then drove on with his bicycle and the prisoner
remained helplessly lying there as MEYER had forbidden all other prisoners to
give any help whatsoever to the beaten girl.
MWTgR always rode through camp without letting himself be seen - in order to find
out if any smoke was coming from any of the chimneys. When noticing any smoke
he immediately went into the Block and beat any prisoner he came across with his
stick without discrimination. Such a case also occurred in the womens Block
217 where I was. We did some cooking for the sick and MEYER had noticed the
smoke. He came into the block immediately and the prisoners who were able to
walk escaped through other doors as they knew that MEYER beat people to death for
such majrters.
That is all I can say on MEYER.

Cloliing-AMress of the Prosecution
iii^	^ase the court,
It is not ray intention to take up very much time in the closing remarks
lout it is the duty of the prosecution to put the facts fairly before the
court and to draw the attention of the court to those parts of the evidence
that may assist the court in coming to the conclusion as to the guilt or
innocence of the accused*
As I said in my opening remarks it is the duty of the prosecution
to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, is guilty of the charges,
laid against him. The first witness for the prosecution in my submission
told his story fairly and with every appearance of truth. He told of the
conditions in the camp; the general behavior of the accused and described
in detail the disgraceful performance of the investigation and said many
times that he was in no possible djfoubt as to the identity of the officer
in charge of that investigation.
He was not shaken in cross-examination nor did he ever alter
his statement of the facts as to what he saw. With regard to the 2 nd witness,
in my submission it appeared that she gave her evidence with truth and
neither was hlie shaken in her story by the cross-examination. She described
some of the events in Belsen, including the beating to death of the Polish
national Mira. She also said many times that she had no d/toubt that the man
responsible for the crime was the man sitting before you in the dock. With
regard to Eva Krause it was unfortunately impossible to bring her before the
court, and in these circumstances I offer her evidence only as corroboration
of the story told by Mafia Goldstein.
She tells of the same horrible scene in all the details and on '
® ,
being shown a photograph she is in no doubt as to the perpetrator of that
crime.
It is also necessary to consider the evidence of the defence ,
in particular, that of the accused himself in the submission of the
prosecution it is clear that the accused has no idea of the word truth nor
of the sanctity of the oath. To take in detail all the many statements made
by the accused would be a long job. I will draw the attention of the. court
in the first place to his statement that he had no idea and knew nothing
of the crimes of Belsen. I suggest that no one can believe that a man could﻿n charge of SS-guards for nine months and not know perfectly well what
.^T	■ i	v'	v - i'
as happening. Vercouteren told us that the only baricades in the camp were of
wire and it was possible to look from one side to the' other. (
Had this man Meyer corns before the court and said that he knew what
was:going on but could do nothing to ’stop it, it may have been a more credible '
. .story. But he denied any knowledge whatsoever of the mass murders, the executions,
and the illtreatments of the. inmates of that camp, I must ask you to use your
judicial knowledge to appreciate in ny submission that his story Yras a pack of
• '
lies from start to finish and his denjfals cannot be taken 1 seriously„
-fith regard to the 2 nd, witness, Tacke, the court may take the. view
in the subBiissiork of the prosecution that this man may. well consider himself
fortunate in not being in the same dock with.Meyer, The same comment may apply
to his evidence as to that of the accused and his denjtals’ of any knowledge after
two years service in the capacity of guard at this camp cannot be believed,
\ 'With regard to Dr, loehdefing it is in the discretion of the court
as to how much weight it can attach to such evidence of character based on the
knowledge of the man in 1940, The court may well think that the tiger is not
always a maneater until he has first tasted blod$ One cannot believe that, there
were any opportunities for such disgraceful parades and flogging.of women, open
to the accused in his hob at the bank. The doctor said he could hardly believe
that this man oould be guilty of such attrocities but he also added that he
would not believe that this man was_in charge of a guard at Belseh, a fact
'	'	' '' l ■ *	, '	. ,	,
that eyer has admitted with apparant pride.
As I said, it is the duty of the prosdcjition to establish this case
beyond all reasonable doubt. If you a±e satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt
and that is the kind .of d/oubt that you may well have in jroUr ordinary personal
affairs and not some fantastic doubt, then it is your duty to find this man
guilty. If on the other hand the prosecution has not satiesfied you, then it
is your pleasure to gUnxit this man.﻿iVVii^s,

ADDRESS
by the
PROSECUTION.
May it please the Court,
There are two ohargea which are made against this accused Curt M5X8S
which relate to incidents in the Bergen-Belsen Camp in the early part
of 1945.
,	The 1st charge is a general charge of ill-treatment and I
shall be calling a witness who will tell you generally of the accused’s
behaviour in that camp. He will tell you of a parade where the accused
beat the prisoners so brutally that some of theta died as a result of
their injuries. And he will tell you that every time Meyer came to the
camp he beat every prisoner he could catoh with a long stick that he
always carried with him.	a
With regard to the 2nd oharge you vd.ll hear evidence of
this from two girls who were prisoners in the camp and who saw the
accused beat a girl by the name of Mira into unconsciousness from which
she never recovered and later died. ,
They will also give evidence as to the .reneral behaviour of Curt Meyer
with regard to the 1st charge.
he accused has made a long statement that X will not read
in its entiresw&Sj in which it seems that his defence will be a denial
of his talcing any part in the treatment of prisoners in Bergen-Belsen.
It will in fact as far as one can judge be a straight issue between the
evidence for the Prosecution and that of the accused as to whether or
not the man whom the witnesses for the Prosecution describe in their
evidence as being responsible for these crimes is in fact the man in
the dock.
It is of course the duty of the prosecution to establish
beyond reasonable doubt that this man Meyer was responsible for this
brutal treatment of the prisoners and the death of Mira.
In the submission of the prosecution the witnesses Aer U*'U
establish these charges and in each case they are quite definite as
to the man responsible.﻿' ' J»

War Crime at Bergen Belsen.
Accused:- Curt MEIER.
The report of investigations, together with statements of witnesses and
accused are enclosed for your consideration and advice to the G.O.C. in C.
The case concerns the beating to death of a Polish girl "Mira", and the
ill-treatment of other prisoners by the accused Meyer; as the witnesses are
with one exception, expecting to go to Palestine in the immediate future, and
as the nationality of the principal victim is clearly established, it is
thought that this case may be most conveniently and promptly dealt with
as a War Crime and tried by a British Military Court.
The original investigation was completed in 1947 but the results were
so unsatisfactory that the case was returned to the Field Investigation
Section so that better evidence might be obtained. The report was
recently returned with the addition of Deposition 6, 7 and 8.
In the interval the two original accused had been released from custody
by mistake. Meyer has been rearrested and will be brought to No. 2 War
Criminals Holding Centre in the next few days. All attempts to trace
Muller have failed, and it is suggested that Meyer be tried alone in 'NM
view of the need for haste.
Meyer was a Wehrmacht Hauptmann who was transferred to the S.S. and
appointed Guard Commander at Belsen from 1 Jan 45-11 April 45. During
this period he held the rank of Hauptsturmfuhrer.
It is alleged that he frequently beat prisoners and that in some cases
the beatings resulted in death.
The internee Breiner (Dep3) speaks of ill treatment of prisoners:
their nationality is not stated, but the Christian names of the sisters
Schwartz suggest that they were also Hungarian. If this is so the
evidence is of no value to the War Crimes case against Meyer, though
it would be used if Meyer is accused of crimes against humanity and tried
before Control Commission Court.
/£he witness﻿* The witness Goldstein (Deposition 5 and 7) give 3 a highly coloured account
of the beating of a Polish Jewess who can be identified by reference to dep-
ositions 4 and 6. The remainder of this witnesses evidence is heresay and
'	' little value due to its uncertainty.
The best evidence is given Krause (Deposition 4 and 6). This witness
appears to have been attracted by screams to the scene of the beating of the
Polish Jewess Mira, and to have witnessed the last part of it. She helped .
carry the unconscious victim to her hut and noticed the results of the ill-
reatment; she also helped carry out the corpse the following morning.
The remaining witness Vercauteren does not speak of the beating of Mira,
but he does give evidence of other cases of ill-treatment by Meyer, of whidi
one instance led to the death of the person beaten. Though the evidence tends
to be vague you may think that the witness should be called to corroborate
the evidence of general ill-treatment and to remove any suspicion of bias
in the evidence of the Polish Jewess?*Goldstein and Krause.
A
The accused Meyer (Deposition l) denies all knowledge of ill-treatment of
prisoners in Belsen and denies having taken part in it himself. He claims
that his duties were purely military and attempts to draw a distinction b
between himself and other 3.3. officers. In view of the complete denial
a second and careful check on his evidence was made by the investigators
and it se ms clear that he is the right man.
The naivete of his-denial may be judged from the quotation of the
instructions that KZ prisoners were not to be ill-treated, and that
corporal punishment could only be inflicted on the approval of the RSHA.
As you are aware, there was in fact an instruction to that effect. The extent
to which it was observed was common knowledge at the end of the war, but
you may think it probable that the present day War Grime Court no longer
shares that common knowledge, and that the prosecutor should be furnished
with some evidence of death and ill-treatment at Belsen, for use in cross
examination.
The usual proforma duly completed, is enclosed herewith.

5, sworn Before J.G.GROSS, Civ. Inv. Officer, of No. 1 Team, Field Investij
?ation Section, War Crimes Group (NWE), at BELSEN, on this nineth day of
October 1947.
I Ewa KRAUSE have been warned that I am not compelled to answer any ques-
tions, but that anythin.;; I say will be taken down in writting and may be
used as evidence
Ich bin Ewa KRAUSE geboren ma 20-IX-1925 in RADOI'i PolenJ
Ibh bin polnischer Nationalitat und JUdischer religion.
Ich bin verheiratet und habe kenme Kinder.
Ic-h bin 1943 verhaftet wdrden und ins KZ 03Y/IECIK .
(Auschwitz) feschickt. Dort verblieb ich ca. eine
Y.'oche und wurde in das KZ HINDENBURG in Oberschlesien
geschickt, wo ich ca. ein Jahr verblieb. Gegen Ende 194^
wurde ich ins KZ DORA geschickt und von dort nach
kKxxxHx BERG LN-BELSEN, wo ich gegen den 1-11-1945 an-
kam. In Belsen blieb ich bis zur Befreiung.
Ich erkenne das Bild des Kurt MEYER, als das Bild des
Pannes der meine Preundin MRS todgeschlagen hat.
Dieser Mann fuhr sehr oft auf einen Fahrrad im Lager
umher. Er hatte immer einen langen und dicken Stock
bei sich mit dem er HSftlinge ohne irgend einen Grund
zu schlagen pfle te. Ic10 personlich bin von ihm nicht
geschlagen worden, r Ber ich habe sehr oft resehen v/ie
er andere HSftlin e geschlagen hat. Einige .meiner
Kameradinen haben mir schwarze, Blut unterlaufene Strie-
ren auf dem Rucken gezeigt, die sie als Ergebniss seines
Schlagens erhalten hr:tten.
'IRA uurde won kEYER Mitte ! arz 1945 geschlagen.
i.eine Preundin 'IRA war eine Polin jlidischer Religion
aus KRA! Sie war ca. 21 Oder 22 Jahre alt.
Ich habe den V^r^all selber gesehen. ’ IRA war eine der
strrksen in der Baracke. Ic lean es beurteilen, den sie

waren schohn so schwach, dass sie ^uf ihren Betten lagei

Keine Kameradinen die den ganzen Vorfall beobaehtet

getroffen hat und zn achiagen anfing. IRA versuchte
vegzulauffen and MEYER fuhr ihr anf dem Rade nach und
schlug sie die ganze Zeit bis sie zusamenbrach xmd
liegen blieb.
MIRA hatte ein diin^s Sommerkleid an und Veine Y/enche.
Das kleid war vom Schlaren zerissen und so konte ich
den Riicken sehen.
Ich mbchte noch ein mal betonen, dass b^vor diesem
Fall MIRA ganz esund war. Ich kan es beurt°ilen da ich
nebenihr lag.
Das ist alles was ich zur Sache sagen kan.

Ich bin Mania Goldstein, geboren am 26.10.19 in WABSCHA.U (Folen).
Heine Beschaftigung ist Damenfriseuse und Hausfrau. Ich bin
polnische Staatsangehorige, jiidischer Abstammung. Ich bin von
judisober Confession.
1)	Im Oktober 1942 wurde ich in STARAGHOWITZE CPolen) von den
Deutschen in ein Arbeitslager eingewiesen, von dort kam ich im JULI
1944 nach AUSCHWITZ, von dort aus im Januar 1945 nach BEISEN .
2)	Ich erinnere mich an folgenden Vorfall, der sich uagefahr Ende
Eebruar Oder Anfaag HARZ 1945 i® Lager BET,SEE abgespielt hat, und
den ich selbst mit angesehen habe. Ich stand mit einigen Frauen
am Fenster in meine™ BLOCK. 214 und sab , dass ein Madchen, ungefahr
22 Jahre alt, nieht weit von meinem Fenster weg , schnell vorbeiliefs
Ein SS-Offizier, den icfe unter dem lamen GUHT MEIEETtanate, rannte
hinter ihr her und rief ihr zu,stehen zu blhifeb* « MEYER hatte
einen KNiippel, ca. 5 cm dick und 60clang , wie immer bei sich.
Das Madchen blieb stehen, mEYER fasste sie ahn , und f&nd Kartotfeln,
die sie unter ihrem Kleid an der Brust versteckt hatte.	f
5) MEYER riss ihr darauf dash KLeid hoch und zog ihr die Unterkleider
aus. Er laegte das Madchen liber sein Enie und schlug sie uagefahr
eine Viertelstunde lang mit seinem Stock auf den nachten Hinterteil.
MEYER geriet in einb sadistische Ekstase und seblug solange auf das
Madchen ein, bis es bewusstlos am Boden lag. Darauf trat er sie aoch
mit den Fiissen. Dann entfernte er sich. Das Madchen lag bewusstlos
Suf dem Boden.
4)	Ungefahr 20 Minuten spaater kaman drei jlidische Frauen und trugen
das Madchen, das immer noch bewusstlos war, weg und brachten sie in
ihren Block. Eile der Frauen erkannte ich als EVA KRAUSE. war nicht
mogllch, das Madchen friiher wegzubringen, da die Frauen zuerst warten
