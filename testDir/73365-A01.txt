Subject? WALTER. Hans.
1.	The above naaed, who is aii-e^eu consistently to have
maltreated Polish workers, is at present in custody at 5 C.I.C.,
Paderborn and is shortly to be interrogated.
2
The following are details of his War Cri. inal activities:
WALTER was in charge of the workers at JAWORZHQ, who
were engaged in constructing electric .1 works* This
camp lies quite close to AUSCHWITZ. Workers under
WALTER were selected from time tc tiae to be sent to
AUSCHWITZ for extermination on the grounds of unfit-
ness and bad workers.
He consistently maltreated workers engaged on the
electrical works by brutally beating them and other
atrocities.
From time to time he gathered together the workers
of the factory and accompanied by SS-rturmfuehrer Dr.
■ WIDELEI (thought to be Dr. Peter . JUELE - SS-Doetor
AUSCHWITZ) selected those who were to be taken away to
AUSCHWITZ -or extermination in the crematorium. It
is estimated that WALTER and SHDELml were averaging
400 to 500 prisoners a month in the furnaces at AUUCHV.ITZ.
The system was that WALTER wrote tiie numbers of victims
on a sh at of paper which he then handed to Dr. LNDELEI
and they were then taken by transport roa the Camp to
AUSCHWITZ. It is alleged that when some of them com-
plained that they were young and wanted to live WALTER
replied that when the' v/or, f ini sued they would all
be going into the chimney so a uay or two earlier would
make no difference. *
Would you please iniOi4 this oij.ico if you require this
accused. The Interrogati
corning this case will Be p
to Trial.
The interrogation report and 0,

Report on Interrogation of FW
LD. 1135 Stubaf Hans A1MEIER
I.
II.
III.
INTRODUCTION
Ff was brought to this Centre for interrogation in connection with
his activities as Schutzhaftlagerfuehrer (penal camp leader) in
AUSCHWITZ between Jun 42 and May 43, and his service with the SS-Bau
(constructional) Brigade and Organisation TODT of the 3. SS Panzer
Corps in the area 0RA.1F.ENBAUM-LENINGRAD.
Pff is not prepared to Admit the full extent of his own guilt
in the mass executions carried out at AUSCHWITZ during his tenure of
office, and blames these outrages on his superiors, especially HIMMLER
and the Camp Commandant in AUSCHWITZ. Nevertheless, AUMEIER was willing
to carry out himself and pass on to his subordinates orders for killings
and other atrocities. In appearance he does not conform to the standards
set by the Third Reich leaders for the Master Race. Undersized, ugly,
and unintelligent, AUMEIER has resigned himself to being brought to
account as a member of the AUSCHWITZ staff for the bestialities
perpetrated there and to take the punishment due to him. FW has admitted
to other prisoners that the information he has so far given of his
activities represents only part of his story, and he is of the view that
"if the Allies want to know any more let them find out."
PERSONAL HISTORY
PW AUMEIER was born in AMBSEG in 1906, the son of a rifle-factory worker.
He attended elementary school for 4 years and grammar school (Real-
schule) for 3 years. He worked as a fitter in a rifle factory in AMBERS
from 1921 to 1925 and afterwards in another factory in MUNICH for a few
months. He was then out of work and took temporary employment in various
German towns,i.e. BERLIN, BREMEN, COLOGNE etc. In 1928 he returned tp
MUNICH and a job which he soon lost, after which he was out of work until
1931. Soon afterwards he was employed as a driver by the Nazi Party (see
para III, below), ^e married in 1931 and has one daughter, aged 14.
PARTY- AND SS-MEMBERSHIP
PW joined the Nazi Party in 1930 (Party No.: 164755) and the ordinary
S3 in Jul 1930. He was promoted as follows: -

IV.	FW1 s SERVICE IN DaCHAU (l5 Jan 34 - Apr 36)
He was posted to an SS De th's Head unit (Totenkopfsturnibann) at DACHAU
in order to receive his 3 months' training and stayed on as instructor
in the section for recruits. When he was promoted Untersturmfuehrer on
20 Apr 34 he was given command of this section in which capacity he served
until Apr 36 when he was posted to the Totenkopfsturmbann 0STFRIE3LAND
and afterwards to the Sturiribann ELBE,
He maintains that, during his whole service at DACHAU, he had no contact
whatever with the prisoners and that, therefore, he never committed any
acts of murder or ill-treatment, but that he was employed solely on the
training of new personnel outside the prisoners' compound.
V. PW1s SERVICE IN AUSCHWITZ
(a)	General
PW was posted to AUSCHWITZ on 16 Eeb 42 as chief of Dept.Ill, Schutz-
haftlagerfueherer (penal camp leader). Also subordinate to PI? were
Dept.Ill (a) (working parties) and the postal censorship. During PW's
time at AUSCHWITZ, the Commandant was Obersturmbannfuehrer HOEHS,
(b)	Gas chamber executions
PW states that during his period at AUSCHWITZ between 15,000 and 18,000
people were done to death in the gas chambers. He denies responsibility,
alleging that gassings were carried out by a special task-force under the
command of Untersturmfuehrer HAES3LER who, together with the members of
the task-force, was directly responsible to the (limp Commandant. PW also
alleges that the force was supervised by Untersturmfuehrer GRABNER who
received his orders directly from Obersturmbannfuehrer HILDEBRAND of the
Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Department of HIMMLER and
KALTENBRUNNER),
Contrary to PW's statements, these gas chamber executions were not carried
out by members of the' task-force alone, but also by camp guards, i.e.
Blockfuehrer and Kommandofuehrer who came under AUMEIER's direct comiand.
PW says he witnessed these gassdngs on several occasions, sometimes together
with the Camp Commandant, sometimes alone.
As was stated at the BELSON trial (of accused who had formerly been
employed at AUSCHWITZ) not only the medical officers at the Camp, but
also certain members of the guard selected prisoners for the executions,
PW AUMEIER'denies this and maintains that this was the responsibility
of the doctors, who on the arrival of new batches of pri'sonors,
/3﻿4

SEORET
immediately picked out all those who were unable to perform heavy work.
These unfortunates were taken at once by lorry to the gas-ohambers and
crematorium which were about 2 miles away from the camp. On arrival they
were taken into a hut where they had to undress after which they were
driven into the gas-chambers. They were told that they were to be dis-
infected, and, in fact, the word 'disinfection' was written on the
outside of the gas-chamber. Then the doors were closed and a member of
the execution squad poured the gas into the chamber through a small
opening at the top or side. The gas was Cyklon B which, PW states,
led to death within half to one minute. On the following day the
corpses were taken by lift to the actual crematorium and. burnt, but not
until other prisoners had been forced to remove gold teeth from the bodies.
During the second half of PW's service at AUSCHWITZ, the bodies of females
had their hair cut off, but PW states that he does not know the reason for
this. The gold of the teeth was collected by the camp dentist, and, as
far as PW knows, sent to BERLIN.
(c)	Ill-treatment of prisoners
The camp guards inside the compounds were under the direct command of
PW AUMEIER, and it was these SS-men who were responsible for the ill-
treatment meted out during AUIVLEIER1 s period at the camp. AUMEIER admits
that he gave detailed orders for the flogging of prisoners (which was
carried out by specially selected 'privileged' pris ners) and that he and
his men frequently used to hit prisoners in the face, but maintains that
they only used their hands and fists. PW himself was present during most
of these floggings. -
A great many prisoners were killed at AUSCHWITZ by members of the guard
commanded by AUMEIER, quite apart from the mass-executions in gas-chambers.
Although AUMEIER tries to shift responsibility for everything that happened
on the Commandant, he admits that he interpreted the Commandant's orders
and passed them on to the lien under his command. In many cases he took
part in the carrying out of these orders. AUMEIER was the senior officer
on the Commandan't staff and the latter's Second in Command, During the
Commandant's occasional absences, PW deputised for him, and on these
occasions the mass-executions, the ill-treatment and wanton killings of
prisoners at AUSCffl'/ITZ were continued by PW AUMEIER in sole charge.
(d)	Prisoners1 living conditions and epidemics
PW admits that it was his responsibility to maintain order and discipline
amongst the prisoners and to see to the cleanliness inside the compounds
as well as to the prisoners1 living quarters, their feeding;, work, etc.,
etc. Thousands of prisoners died in AUSCHWITZ due to the appalling
conditi ns, in which epidemics could not be avoided. Despite their
inadequate rations, prisoners were forced to carry out heavy physical
work, and, on many occasions, were done to death during work by the
guards.
PW states that, as the result of epidemics, approximately 3,000 prisoners
died at AUSCHWITZ from 'natural causes', but is not prepared to admit
the number of people killed by his guards.
(e)	Additional persons available as witnesses or accused
A number of SS-persohnel at present held by PYi/lS (Norway) held positions
at AUSCHWITZ under PW's command and have made written declarations which
incriminate him for his activities there.

In May43PW waa .pested to -.Senior SS'and Police Chief 'OSTIii-ND'
Obergrappenfuehrer JECKELN, and was attached to the SS Construction
Brigade of 3 SS Panzer Corps. This Brigade was building fortifications
in the area OliiMENBitlll-LENINGR/iD, and had under its command the
OT (Organisation TODT) Oberbauleitung A, which belonged to the OT
Einsatzgruppe 1Russiand-Word’ (Russia-North), commanded by
Oberbaudirekior GIJVIPLE, -
AUMEIER himself was in charge of the Jews from RUSSIA and LITHUANIA
who were employed by this notorious unit. AUMSIER had about 7,000 Jews
under his command who were quartered in several camps specially built by
the OT in Northern RUSSIA and Northern ESTONIA. In this task FW was
assisted by a Bn of Estonian Police. He denies that atrocities were
committed against these Jews who were Hussion and Lithuanian nationals
and says they were treated well in every respect. As a result of the
Red Army's advance, FW had to evacuate his prisoners several times until
they were finally transported back to DANZIG- - STUTTHOF concentration
camp.

STATM3H!!?
I learned through the press that the former commandant of the
Auschwitz conoentration camp, SS-Ohersturnbonnfuehrer Hoess had "been
arrested and th t in a written confession he had declared that until
the end of 1943 he had received the order to gas 2 million internees -
especially Jews - at Auschwitz.
I was at Auschwitz from August 1942 until August 1944, and was
instructed by the combat unit of the Auschwitz concentration camp to
take charge of the work bf this SS-supervised combat unit. Through
this I also had insight into the crime of the now arrested Hoess.
“ In November 1943, Hoess was transferred from Auschwitz to the SS-
Fuehrungs & Verwaltunghauptamt (Administration HQ) in Berlin when an inspection
confirmed that the wholesale murder of the internees was not reported to
Berlin correctly. Hoess did everything possible from his end to be
transferred back to Auschwitz, especially as he had the possibil ty of
enriching himself at Auschwitz as in no other concentration camp because
at Auschwitz the property of the murdered people was placed at the disposal
of the SS and primarily at that of the commandant.
Hoess returned to Auschwitz in the spring of 1944, first of all as
commandant but then SS-Sturmbannfuehrer Baer was appointed commandant, and
Hoess was instructed to carry out the liquidation of the Jewish transports
arriving from Hungary. This commenced on May i6th 1944', and was carried out
under the covering name of ’’Operation Reinhart”. In this operation many
hundreds of thousands of Jews were murdered. I could not ascertain the
exact figure as I was transported away from Auschwitz at the end of August
while this operation was still being carried out. If any technical difficulties
occurred which hampered the speedy gassing of the Jewish internees. Hoess
always did everything possible to speed up the mass murders during the
operations.
Then the crematorixmis were not sufficient for the burning of the
daily arriving victims, Hoess ordered that the corpses should be burnt
on pyres neat to the crematoriums. When the poison gas/ ”2yklon B” ran
short and therefore the gassing could not be carried out at the speed which
Hoess demanded, he gave definite orders and took personal responsibility
that the children from the Jewish transports should not be put into the
gas chambers but should be thrown alive on to the burning pyres. He ordered
that healthy, strong men should be selected from the Jewish transports
and should throw the children - thus their own children - into the fire.
While this was going on an order came from Berlin on the instigation of
individual SS-officers who were already influenced by the combat unit in
1944, that the Jews from the Hungarian transports who were capable of
working, should not be sent to the gas chambers as labour was needed, but
Hoess prevented this order from coming into full force. Again and age in he
gave his own orders that all those who had been chosen from the transports
as being capable of working should be examined again p-nd those who had
become weak and ill in the meantime should be sent into the gas.
At a conference with SS-camp doctor from Auschwitz, SS-Sturmbannfuehrer
Dr. YTirths, Hoess declared that no one was to interfere with operation
/"Reinhart"..﻿"Reinhart” and that he would see to it that all intervention from Berlin
would fail. This report was given to the combat unit by Dr. Wirths
through me. By order of Hoess the constant executions were still
carried out in block 11 (Bunker) at Auschwitz camp. Hoess was always
present or informed when internees from the Gestapo at Kattowitz were sent
to the court of summary jurisdiction and then for execution t<2> Auschwitz.
Mrs. Hoess naturally knew of her husband’s actions. Proof of
this is in a reiaabk made to a Bible student who — as a prisoner - was
working in her house: "If the Poles ocrae you must poison children
as they would kill us all under the most dreadful tortures as they wish
to revenge themselves".

the Pole case to which you refer? Is the decision,
that the whole of the AUSCHWITZ Concentration Camp

in LONDON? We hold approximately 100 persons in

Camp we have a great deal of evidence upon it
and if it is decided that the whole case is to be

Extracts from the report of Doctor KhREL SPEKBER on AUSCHWITZ
and other concentration canips*
The train stopped at 9.50 p.nw and I saw the illuminated sign "AUSCHiUTZ",
we were then ordered out, and put into rows of five, the total number made
89, of all European nationalities including one German count, many Czechs
a few Poles and Jews. Then about 20 young S.S. men came around us, armed
with automatic guns and' ordered us to march, nobody spoke we were too intent
in trying to march normally. The guards themselves were talking' to each other
and I heard different Ger.nan dialects mainly Bavarian and Austrian. After
marching for about three-quarters of an hour, over what looked like very bad
fields, I saw the Camp, surrounded by high white pillars, each with an
electric light, above a white wall.	we came nearer, I saw many floors in
the houses which seemed quite large. We stopped before a big white painted
iron gate above which was a sign written in large letters, 'bUBEIT MACHT FRET",
i.e. "Work liberates".
When I had told my story I asked questions about the camp, they did not tell
me very much. The first one.told me, that in the morning I would get numbered,
some 82,000. In this camp there were about 18,000, and that he could not
tell me much more, but that I could think for myself what I wanted.
They told me that there was a camp hospital consisting of three barracks and
equipped for more than two-thousand patients, and also that Typhus was raging
in the camp. Lately they had employed many prisoner doctors in that camp....
Each morning all of us had to go for drill and-marching and learning
HTJGTZBNiiB-MJTZE}/! - which means taking your camp in your right hand, and eyes
left, then AUG - return the camp to your head. Each S.S. nan had to be
greeted like that under all conditions, it was punishable offence to omit it,
some of the older men quickly showed signs of fatigue with these long hours
of marching and standing. On being dismissed the floor of the room had to
be washed and left wet and all had to take their boots and socks off and ste.nd
bare footed. In was pretty cold on that wet floor ... The second day, one
of tho Room Seniors, in the other room from mine, hit one of the new arrivals,
a Norwegian, his brother wanted to attack the Room Senior in his brother’s
defence. This was told at muster to the S.S. Block Leader and while wo
were waiting to'be counted we heard a loud noise like someone throwing a
body on the floor and sounds of severe fighting going on in the Block Senior's
room, this lasted for as long as 12 mins, and then the S.S. man came out
breathing heavily, and started his usual pount. After muster I saw these
two Norwegian brothers who were powerfully built men about 6,4 being carried
out dead.. Now we knew what all the noise was and why the S.S. loan had
breathed so heavily.
On the 4th morning the Block Senior came for me and told me to follow him
to the Krankenbaum (hospital) saying I would have to work there. There
were three of us, two Polish doctors, one 'sc surgeon named GRABCINSKl a
physician and myself. It was a cold December day and he led us to Block
28 where there was a sigh saying- "For Internal Diseases". We had to undress
completely and our number;; were written with an indelible pencil on our
chests, and on our left upper arms. A-record cardjwith number, name and
nationality was made out. Yfe had to place all our clothes together, put
them in a tidy bundle and leave them on the stair way, and then proceed to
the waiting room. There came the first shock, on both sides of the room
were bunks occupied by patients, in the middle wore about a hundred naked
creatures, the room stank. Behind the door lay one completely exhausted
another like a skeleton lay dead, another on a stretcher had a broken leg
without a bandage or a splint, one eye completely black and protruding.
The others all terribly thin with legs swollen to three times their normal
size like Elephantitis, the faces at least double normal size, very swollen
especially around the eyes. Many had large wounds about 8 - 10" long with
big yellow pus oozing out and no dressing, others lying in the bunks were
dying of exhaustion. GRABCINSKI and I looked at each other with shocked
faces,, we did not speak a word. It was by far the most distressing sight
/ I﻿
I looked at each other with shocked faces, we did not speak a word. It
was "by far the most distressing sight I had ever seen and yet I knew I
would have to get used to much worse before very long.
At 9.30 a.m. we were prepared in the big ambulance room for introduction to
the S*S» Doctor, We. handed, over our cards and had to remain very quiet,
we all were of course completely naked and we three doctors, although having
lost a little weight, were healthy specimens compared to those living corpses.
Tfe stood to attention as the S,S. Doctor came in escorted by the Block Senior
of the hospital and another S«S. man. We three doctors were called in front,
"Turn around, alright, get dressed". We gave a last gaze at those poor
creatures all of whom could hardly walk and went out onto the stairway, picked
up our clothes and dressed, .and we were directed to Block 21 opposite, the
Surgical Departments. I went to the right wing, GRABCINSKI, to the left
on the first floor, v.'hat a terrible stone.h, it hit no in the face
almost bowling, mo over. The. first flcsjr was sop-r-ted into tvro big wardsj
in each there wtre about four hundred bunks and in .each bunfc nt
least three and soi utimeu four, patients., nearly all with, ■bi" infected
open wounds, (phleg lonous cellulitis) cf a size no1 surgeon would evor
nor wily yee. They we re. dre s s e d ivi co a w e -c k w it h only
paper bandages which lasted only about ten or five minutes,. By then they
were soaked by quantities of pus which ran over their limbs onto the other
patients or onto the straw mattresses, which of course were soon rotted.
In some bunks there '.was one or. even two corpses among the living. There
was no place for me in the little room separated from the main ward only by
a number of small cupboards, so the Commander of the Ward, in civil life a
policeman and a good chap, ordered me to sleep in the ward amongst the ■
patients. I/iy duties were to empty the refuse cans when full, carry tea at
5,30 a.m. soup at 11,30 a.m. and bread at 2,30 p.m. carry out the corpses
with another male nurse, to help dressings during the■ fore-noon, sweep the
floor and the corridor, and clear the snow from the front door and keep the
W.C. clean. I also ‘had to relieve the door-keeper when ever necessary,
unload coal trucks and bring in the coal, help to delouse new arrivals,
carry lousy blankets and underwear to be fumigated and bring clean ones back
and after v/orking- hours help to delouse the detainees from normal blocks.
One had never to be standing around or without work, and smoking daring
working hours was strictly forbidden. Only a handkerchief was allowed to
be. retained in ray pocket during these working hours, and cigarettes or
tobacco after duty. I soon made a few friends who told me little things
but" most people were very abrupt as I was only a new arrival, and all that
was expected of mo was to get up first in the morning to work all day long
with as little food as ppssiblc and to go to bed when everything was done.
For a better understanding I would like to give new a whole account of
organisation and methods of Gestapo methods in Concentration.Canjps.
In a short space of time at the beginning of the war there were many more
camps', Auschwitz (.Birkenau) near Kobowice in Upper Silesia, 1939-40,
Maidanky — Lublin in Central Poland, Stotthof — near Daufy, Plossenburg on the
Czech-Bavarian Frontier 1939, C-rossrosen near Breslau, Riga. in Latvia and
Borgen—Belsen near Hanover, Mittleb.au in Middle -Germany and o.11 in Thuringia.
These were all-'main camps and each of' them had many branch. camps especially
for Slave labour in the German war industry.- The worse extermination camp
Was unfortunately Auschwitz .(Oswiecim) with Eirkenau. It covered a ground
of about 12 sq, miles and the camp itsolf was about two and half miles away
from the -town of Auschwitz and. used "t0 a cavalry barracks. As soon.as
the Germans conquered Upper Silesia they began to convert the barracks into
a Concentration Camp. For that reason 35 long term German Detainees, all
of them professional criminals were moved from Sachsenhausen — Oranienburg
to Auschwitz and were put into key positions. They wore allowed to grow
their hair long, also to wear good clothing, and had not to show the sign
which was normally shown by the professional criminal types. They were
treated as so-called "Honorary Detainees", The numbers were given out
systematically'to new arrivals, and when one died his number was not given .
to a new arrival as was done in other concentration camps. Haeftling, (Detainees)
were classified into special categories besides nationality.
/ The﻿The first ooramandant of Auschwitz was S.3. Obersturrabannfuhrer Hoess, 4-0 years
old Prussian, one'of the biggest murderers the world has ever known and
intimate friend of Himmlers. The first camp leader was S.3. Hauptsturmfuhrer
Aumeier a 5ft 2inoh high Bavarian, an old Nazi Party member and a member-of
the Reichstag for a Bavarian district. His deputy and successor S.S.
Hauptsturmfuhrer Schwartz one of the biggest brutes I ever saw and I have seen
many. The Camp Leader of Birkenau S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer Sohwarzuber,
supervisor of exterminations and the medical officer who played a big part
directed by the S.S. Stordstenfuhrer Dr. Lolling, medical officer in charge
for all concentration camps in Germany, were also criminals of the worst type.
S.S. Sturmbannfuhrer (Major S.S.) Dr, Wirths from Hitler's bodyguard, "Lerbatondort
Adolf Hitler",' S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer (capt SS.) Fischer, also from Hitler's
bodyguard division. Prof. Dr. Clauberg, professor of Gynaecology and directors
of the women's clinic in Koenigsbutte near Kakowice and previously of the
University in Koenigsberg, who built up a certain block of,the camp for women
for experiments and Oberleutnant of the Luftwaffe Dr. Kaufman who was responsible
for sterilisation and castration experiments with young men; all these •were
fanatical brutes. But the worst of all doctors was definitely S.S.
Hauptsturmfuhrer (Capt S.S.) Dr. Entres, born in Poznan in Poland, who selected
most of the poor detainees from the camps for extermination in the Gas Chambers
and for killing and torturing, others of which I will describe later. Long
time Chief "of the Political (security) Department dor the camps S.S.
Untersturmfuhrer (Lieut.SS) Grabner who ordered deliberately without any reason,
thousands to be beaten and shot. As chiof executors should be noted above
all the N.G.O. of the S.S. - S.S. Hauptscharfuhrer (R.Sgt Major. SS) Palitsch
and S.S. Oberscharfuhrer (S.S, Sgt Major) Stiebitz, specialists in the
notorious neck shot S.S, Oberscharfuhrer (Sgt. S.S.) KLchr-from the medical
personnel who killed with his own hands' at least 30,000 by-intracardial
injections of carbolic acid, and above all S.S. Hauptscharfuhrer (Reg.Sgt Major
SS) Moll, a Bavarian butcher, by looks and deeds who together with S.S.
Unterscharfuhrer (Corporal S.S.) Eokerth from Vienna, and a member of the
S.S. Regiment Der Fuehrer, responsible for the gas chambers, crematoriums
and the worst so called "Punishment Company".
For internal command and control a Camp Senior was selected by the S.S. until
194-3, Detainee No.1 Bruno Brodniewioz, a G-erman professional’criminal, very
strongly built, detained already ten years, a smith by profession, and a
ruthless and fanatical killer, who worked hand in hand with the S.S. Camp
Leader, and the Security Department, He was always smartly dressed and was
never seen without a large heavy whip. Everybody had to greet him by
removing his oap, and anyone who did not were always punished as the S.S.
took his advioe about most internal matters.
I would like to condemn a Dr. Dering, a Warsaw Gynaecologist, who became chief
surgeon and who performed all the experimental operations on the women and
castrations on the men; very often' on his own responsibility ho sent many to
their deaths. Thinking his work was good in this respect he was later able to
volunteer to work for the Germans and was released to work in the women's
clinic of Professor Clauberg, the chief experimenter with; women at Auschwitz,
he also changed his nationality from Polish to German,
In describing the Camp, I must mention' the horror Block 11, situated in tho
right corner of the camp, it was situated different to all the other blocks,
where the space in between 2 blocks was open, with a high briok wrall separating
it from Block 10, From the road there was a gatewhich could be entered by
a- lorry or a truck. Opposite, the gate there was a huge black-board like
a disc on the wall and in front of it there was always fresh yellow sand on
the ground. In the left corner there was a gallows and one so called tree
on the right. In the cellar of Block 11 there were the bunkers ( detention
cells) of°different shape and size. On the ground and first floors there
lived the punishment company, later the quarantine section. There were
large cells with daylight coming in, dark.colls without light, and small
cells with a low ceiling. The door was .always locked and opened only after
a bell had been rung by an S.S. man who was there all day long and who was
called the Bunker Master. The gaoler, a specially .selected strong man, at
first Kurt Pennewitz from Leinzig, a butcher by profession, with whom I later
/ became﻿-
became very well acquainted, and succeeded by Jacob, a Latvian Jew in 1943,
a very strong man indeed, who was for a time Max Schmeling's sparring
partner. The Yellow sand in front of the black board was the theatre of
exooutions, thousands of detainees, men and women, and hundreds of civilians
were executed here. I was there quite a‘few times by order, once at a mass
execution of 480. Many prisoners were executed there because of their
membership of an anti-Nazi movement years ago, for bringing spirits into the
camp,'or for selling a gold tooth out of her own mouth, or keeping some
valuable ring.as a souvenir from home. To form a formal commission there
were the Camp Leader, the representative of the Political Department of the
Camp, the S*8« Doctor, and the NCO responsible for the correct muster, who
had at the same time a roll of executor* The prisoners destined to be shot
were only allowed to wear'a shirt if a woman, and if a man they had to appear
naked, they were led out by the jailer in twos and placed with their faces
to the black wall;	The executor used a six mm. Flobert rifle -with ten
rounds in it, and placed it directly at the back of the prisoner's heads,
where the brain leads to the .spine and he would pull the trigger, the small
calibre.rifle makes no noise ;at all, so it was soon finished. The victim
immediately fell forward into a position like a frog, this is the notorious
neck shot wound of Nazi. Germany of which many thousands have died. Yfe were
standing by already with stretchers to take the corpses away immediately and
to load' a truck with them. It was very quick and the 480 were done in about
half an hour. Fresh yellow sand .was put on top of the crimson wall blood,
there were never any incidents of resistance. The victims went mostly to
their death with set faces, .sometimes laughing and cursing the Germans
predicting that they would be punished 'ere long, and damning them to
everlasting hell. The Block 11 was a set place for punishments consisting
of beating, and lashings,‘anything from 25-100 on to the buttock for very
little offences paid out'in regular intervals under the supervision of the
Camp Leader and the S»S, Doctor. There was a specially constructed table,
where;the victim had to lie down and was beaten with a rubber pipe, inside
which there was wire, sometimes the punishment would be dealt out by two
men, one beating from either side, quite often the victims were beaten
outside the Block in full view of the whole camp. Leading prisoners,
well fed and strong, rarely S.S» .men, had to perform a punishment I have
described. A mother with her two children, a seven and three year old
respectively, was hiding somewhere in Boland, in order to escape imprisonment
and detention. Both the children were brought to Block 11. They did not
know where their mother was, but the S.S. thought the older child knew and
wanted to find out. They took this innocent blonde child, stripped her naked
and a 6ft 3 hugh strong S.S. man gave her 50 strokes with a heavy rubber
whip, putting into it his whole strength, the tortured heart breaking cries
could not be borne by us, and of course, she was dead half an hour later.
The small cells in Block 11, 40" square and about 5’2" high were for a
special kind of minor punishment, the so called standing arrest, which lasted
through the night. I myself was officially- punished because I was reported
smoking a cigarette stub during working hours by Leader Stiebitz. We were
delousing 100 completely lousy detainees in the big bathroom and I, being
choked and disgusted with the filth and stench, lighted the sub.	Stiebitz
saw me through a window of the opposite block he was inspecting.	He asked
for my number at once. ’ Three weeks later, after wondering every hour
what would happen to me, I was officially punished by a sentence of 5 nights
standing arrest. That means at work during the day.and at 8 p.m. at night
the camp collector rounded up all those who were to be punished and brought
them to Block 11, 4~5 were squashed into one of those small cells, all
pressed together unable to sit or lie down, or ever, to stand and to sleep.
Of course, at 6,30 a.m, all wore thrown out again in order to go to work.
The punishment was, 5,10 and 20 nights accordingly, I was fortunate enough to
get a little rest during the day. For some of my comrades, who had heavy
work to do outside during the day, 10 nights of this punishment was fatal
in all cases. On the so called tree the prisoners were suspended by their
hands which were bound behind their backs, with their feet only ten inches
from the ground, this enabled them to be questioned and was indeed a
terrible torture where many broke their wrists,. but were not allowed to
be treated in hospital, it was abolished in 1943. In the summer of 1942
a first experiment with Potassium of Cyanide was carried out so far this
/ had
1
﻿had only been used for futaigation of concrete houses from hugs and lice; eight
high Russian officers were used in the cell of Block 11. The deadly results
were reported hy S.8. Hauptsturmfuhrer (Capt &*S«) Pritsche to Berlin and were
then adapted for quick mass extermination of thousands of people.
Block 10, which was at first a long Block was in 1943 oojt.verted under the control
of Professor Olauherg and S.3* Hauptsturmfuhrer (S.S. Major) Dr. Wirths into an
exp>erimental Block for/women. One evening the whole hospital staff was called
upon and equipped with Buckets, Brooms and Brushes, all the doctors, male nurses
and orderlies were ordered to clean and prepare Block 10 and some were ordered
to Bring water along. All together there were about 100 of us working and by
10 o'clock at night the place was clean. The next day new Blankets etc were
taken in and the sign "KrahkenBau" was put- on the door. Two days later five
women* nurses from the women's camp at Birkenau camp arrived, together with
Professor' ClauBerg a little monkey like man, who wore jack Boots and a feather
in his hat, he always came and went in his snail car. The next day we were
ordered to make preparation to delouse some new arrivals in the Big Bathroom.
150 women now arrived in big transports and were marched into the camp and then
into the Bathroom. Young girls ly-'IS years old, women Between 20-30, older
women about 50-60 years of age, and a few pregnant ones, all clean and well
dressed, made up this number, they were accompanied By a few terrible looking
3*3. women who were equipped with pistols, whips, and Bloodhounds, and a few
young S.S. men followed By No.2 Camp Leader. S.S* Hauptaturmfuhrer (Capt. S.S.)
Schwaatl, a fat Bavarian like Goering and horsegroom in civilian life before
Hitler oame into power. The 5 nurses had clippers and razors, and the women
were ordered to undress naked, driven on By the guards, who shouted and kicked
them. The nurses then-Began to cut the hair off thoir heads and Bodies; we
waited Behind the stove so that we should not see this terrible scene.. The
young S.S. men amused themselves By pointing and prodding with their fingers
the poor naked women. After all were clean shaven, the nurses v/ere ordered
to delouse them. Commandant Schwaatl, was not satisfied with the routine and
manner in which they did this, so ordered them away and told the men to do it,
us amongst them* It was revolting. These poor women covered their faces
with their hands Because of their great shame. We had to put the Naptha onto
them all over their Bodies, need I say we felt deeply humiliated But simply
were forced to do it. After the Bath they were issued with disinfected old
Russian military uniforms and a little coloured cloth the size of a pocket
handkerchief to cover their shaven heads. All the hair from the women had to
Be kept and must never Be Burnt under any circumstances, I think it was for
making mattresses or similar thing for the German Reich. Then these poor
tortured females wore marched into Block 10 to Become human guinea pigs. The
soientifio work which they were kept for consisted, after a huge X—ray apparatus
had Been installed and a gyneacologioal operation theatre made, mainly of
artificial insemination, X-ray castrations, artificial inplantation of cancer
cells into the cervix of the womb, air through the sexual organs, transplantations
of the ovaries, and objects for training for young S.S. doctors in gyneacological
operations. Sometimes these creatures were used for the sexual libide of men
after an experimental X-ray sterilisation of the testicles or after operations for
semi or complete castration.. Professor OlauBerg was in charge of that Department,
Doctor Dering and an old prisoner Professor Salomon, who performed most of the
operation. There was much talk about scientific discoveries. But I know
definitely that absolutely nothing new was discovered By these experiments.
This Block was later filled up and housed altogether 500 women.
Another very common punishment for minor offences such as Being a little late
for muster,nor Being slow in coming out of Barracks or marching Badly was a
treatment called "Sport". .A, few men or all the Capos or a whole working command,
or.sometimes a whole Barrack, v/ere ordered out and under the command of one or
more S.S. men, it commenced. "Run, lie down, up, run, march, march, lie down,
run, lie down, naroh" and so on for about half an hour; then they would order
us to roll over and over- along the ground so that in wet weather everyone
Became soaking wet and covered with mud* The S.S. went amongst the prisoners
and.kicked them in the face or belly if they thought they were not putting
their Best into it, used their whips on them if they wished to do so. Afterwards,
when all the detainees were completely exhausted the S.S. turned their Bloodhounds
amongst them, and generally they were very Badly Bitten in the legs and arms.
/ After
m﻿~ 6 -
p*
Aftor about two hours of this treatment everj^one was half dead with fatigue.
I remember not long after I came to the camp 8. S. N.C.O. Klehr took five of
us, because one Pole who could not understand German very well and had turned
right, on the- command to turn left; I was beside him and the- four others were
in the-vicinity, and ordered, us'to be punished by "Sport". It lasted over
two hours. One.1 Dutch doctor died half an hour later, the Pole, a doctor of
about 50 years of age, was in hospital for throe weeks and we three remaining
ones were completely exhausted* I remember that I could not get in and out
of ray bunk for over a fortnight, I felt as if every bone in my body had been
broken..
The first "Mass Transports" came to Auschwitz in April 1942 from Slovakia,
mostly young men and women. As they entered the camp they were greeted by
the impressive Camp band of 160 musicians. At this tine there were no gas
chambers, but the poor people died like flies from typhus or were beaten to
death* Out of 18,000 young'men, who -were classified as being very strong
and useful v/orkers orly 210 were left alive after a year* One of the first
Slovakian female transports contained about 800 young girls between the ages
of 15 and 21 years. This is an actual fact and occured in 1942, it was told
to me by the young fiance .of one of my doctor friends* Jakabovit. All the
girls had to undress in front of a largo number of S*S. men; Dr. Entres
examined them single handed to see if they were still virgins. Any girl who
was not was passed on, but any who wore, were given to the waiting S*S. for
immediate defloration* .Poor pretty young girls, after about half of them
were examined in this way it was stopped by the Oanp Leader S.S. Hpt Aumeier,
otherwise a ruthless uurdeier, to whom this was too much* Until 1942 all
the corpses were buried in mass graves in the grounds of the smaller craap
Birkenau. In early 1942 Crematorium No*1 camouflaged to like a large air
raid shelter and only recognisable by the high chimney to people who were in
the camp, was built a few yards from the entrance to the main Auschwitz Gamp,
just opposite the S.S. riv.eir (sick-bay). In September 1942 the first gas
chamber was ordered by Berlin after the successful experiment with the eight
Russian officers in Block 11. It was made in a small wooden barrack situated
three quarters of a mile away from Birkenau camp, and soon afterwards the
order came through to build three more modern crematoriums with large gas
chambers attached for the biggest slaughterhouse the world has ever known
behind Birkenau camp. The oven installations were supplied by a factory in
Espert, and were fed by crude,oil or coke.
Beginning from September 1942, transports arrived day and night from all
European countries, sometimes five or six.in twenty four hours. This is what
happened, after the German army had occupied a new territory for about three
weeks, the so-called Rosenberg Committee arrived. After all the Jews had
been collected into a Ghetto, the Ghetto senior in many cases the Chief .Rabbi,
or some other outstanding personality, was ordered to..pick a thousand strong
men for work in a factory in Germany or Poland. They would be allowed to take
their families with them, and parents and grandparents if they wished, also
they should take all their necessary.belongings. They would have to work but
be allowed to live with their families, they were told. For the women and
older people there would be lighter work arranged.' For the very old and sick
and children other facilities would also be made. These people believed all
this of course and were taken to a transport train consisting of cattle trucks,
generally with very poor sanitary arrangements, and 50-60 people were forced
into one wagon in one transport there was generally between 1300-3500, which
means a train of 20-40 wagons. They were also advised to take sufficient
food for a few days after arrival because things might not be properly
organised at first* The wagons were sealed and the guarded by S.S. When
the trains arrived at the temporary and specially prepared sidings between
Auschwitz S.S. and one of the Camp Leaders. One or two doctors were always
present, and also a large number of guards, and a working party of detainees.
When everybody was out of the train the order was given for the people to
leave their heavier,luggage arid stand back. The first fear and sorrow crept
into their minds, but the S.S. officer in charge explained they would receive
their baggage later in . the big camp as it would be transported by lorries,
and they should mark it clearly with their names ... Later all the men were
ordered to the left and the women and children to the right. The
/'heartbreaking﻿~ 7 ~
J)
heartbreaking scenes conuaenced, many women end children started to cry* They
naturally did not want to leave each other, and many had to be parted by force,
and then the shouting and beatings started, for the S,S., rough and ruthless,
it was no problem and they, soon mastered the situation very .quickly. The, so
.called medical inspection began, and very strong men of ages-between 20-35
were separated from the others; sometimes some special professional men and
tradesmen were also separated out. After that all the women-were inspected
and the very young ones between 13-25 years of age were also separated out.
Young women with children had to stay however, and then the selected men and
women were marched off to their respective camps. They were roughly about
8-10 per cent of the men,, and 5-6 per cent of the women out of the whole
transport, the remaining 85 per cent, older people, and.young children, had
to wait andqvere later taken away on lorries. It was really unbearable and
impossible to describe the feelings we experienced, it took all our self control
to be able to stand all this. Lovely small and older children, well educated
and beautifully dressed, pretty YYomen, poor old people, crippled and sick ones
and thousands of middle aged people in the prime of their lives, and often
at the top of their professions. I can never forget the look in the many
pairs of eyes of tho^e poor little children, but thank God, they did not know
what was going to happen to them.and still went on hoping.for the best. Many
people, especially mothers, whose husbands had been taken away, seemed to sense
something was wrong. During this time many 8.S. men could be seen loitering
about the luggage, and very often we could see them stuffing something into
their pockets. Then large trucks arrived and the prople were hastened in with
the help of kicks and beatings. After they were full-they wore moved off to
get "disinfected" to the acoompaniment of the cries of youhg children who
had been hurt in the mad crush and stampeded into the lorries. They wore
forced to get out and enter a large building marked "disinfection and bathroom"
in nearly all the European languages. Everybody had'to undress completely
and v/ere each given a towel and soap .... Men were ordered to the left and vromen
to the right. There was an anteroom and a big room led off it with heavy
doors marked "bathroom". Inside there were what appeared to be shovrers, but
only very small windows and electric light. The doors and windows vrere
hermetically shut when all the people had been crammed in, and outside an S.S.
man put on his gas mask. Big two gallon yellow drums were carried in by
internees; they looked something like a large marmalade tin, with a label,
"Qyklon" - potassium cyanide in blueish pieces of about one inch in length
and half an inch broad, which spread the deadly gas when they come in contact
with warm air. The 8.S. man opened the tvfo or three tins quickly YYith a
special opener, and through a small hole which could be hermetically sealed,
he' threw the pieces of Cyklon into the bathroom, shutting the hole after him.
A last long and painful cry of thousands of voices would be heard, women and
children’s voices could easily be distinguished, and then complete silence.
In 2 - 5 minutes all were dead.
The so called Sendercommando consisting of 500 strong prisoners who vrere only
picked from nevY transport arrivals and v/ho Were exchanged every three months,
(that means the rest who had worked wore shot) now went to vrork. A few YYith
gas masks opened the doors and VYindows; ventilators and fans brought in fresh
air. After the air was cleared, a few specialist workers YYith forceps had
to open the mouths of the dead bodies and extract all gold fillings and gold
teeth'and collect all spectacles, and search the bodies including'the vagina
YYhere sometimes gold and jewels v/efe found. All this'Was done under the S.S.
in charge. Other prisoners lifted the still .Warm corpses onto little trucks
which wore run on special rails each carrying three to bight corpses and the
trucks were run direct to the crematorium* Crematoriums II, III and IV in
Birkonau plus Wo*1 at Auschwitz had a capacity by full action to cremate
betvYeen 15,000 - 20,000' in twenty-four hours. Huge fires-could be seen splashing
out of the chiraricys during the night tine and a smell of burnt organic substance
similar to the smell in a butcher’s shop was continuously in-the air. ' All
arrivals on the lorries could be seen by the inmates of Birkenau and very often
we could see the S.S. ambulance marked YYith the INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS
COME PULL OP wooden boxes containing the Cyklon tins.
During the early days, there was much VYork for most commands, who were not
/ directly﻿directly employed in maintaing the camp3 S*3» huildingSj agriculture in
order* in specialised work in the DAff (Deutsche Aufrustungsv/erke), which
means auxiliary factory for the German arpament industry. These
auxiliary factories were' attached to each camp* and the work was very
heavy and daily the workers would he heaton vdth whips, rifles and rubber
truncheons, or shot for bad behaviour, or just dropped doom exhausted and
died* Later the German government made use of them and sent them into
the coal mines, cement and brick factories where they did the heaviest
work and later into general armament- factories.
A branch camp was started at Buna, three miles away from Auschwitz where
the I.G. Parben trust had built an enormous factory for the production of
artificial rubber out of coal, synthetic alcohol, and carbide. There
were thousands of civilian forced workers, Poles, 'Ukraineans, French,
Italians, Russians and later 500' British prisoners of war. In the
beginning 2500 detainees wont every day by train to this factory, returning
at night and later another Branch Camp (Arbeitslager Monowitz) named by
the nearby village, was built which could hold 11,000 detainees. Thousands
and thousands died working at- this factory. Later a cement factory was
opened at Gollesov near Bielsko, where 500 prisoners worked and 1200
prisoners were.sent to the coal mines of Javisovice.
In the beginning of 1943, The High Command of the S.B. decided to send more
of the prisoners to branch camps to help with the work of the German War
Machine, e.g. coal-mining, cement factories, heavy and small arms
industries. Tt was decided to send one working party to Eintrachthuettc,
which- lies about miles west of the Polish town of Katowice; for me it
was a very sad occasion, and the last few years went through my memory
as I stood once again on the railway station of this town/’ It was here
that I originally started my first voyage to freedom after my escape '
from the occupation of Czechoslovakia in April 1939.
Xte were guarded by 60 young S.S. men, and were placed in cattle-trucks,
fifty in each. We arrived, after four hours journey in the marshalling
yard of the Osmag machine factory which had- been.built by German
industrialists after the occupation of Poland. Wo prisoners were
supposed to* enlarge the production of 8,8 centimetre. Heavy Ack-Ack guns.
The Gamp Leader was S.S. Hauptscharfuhrer.Joseph Reramele, a member of the
concentration camp guards since 1933 and trained in the notorious camp of
Dachau. His second in command 'was S.S. Oberscharfuhror Herman Kleeman,
a member of the Startdarte Germania and who' had been for two years the chief
jailer in the horror block 11 at Oswdecim, .
We marched on and eventually arrived in a small camp consisting of throe very
dirty barracks surrounded by ordinaiy barbed wire entanglement's, S.S.
officer Aumeier Schwartz shouting at us and:giving orders all the-time. 'Jo
were given two rooms for the hospital and of course there was no
equipment or medicaments whatsoever. The first arrivals had to naturally
build up a camp, and once again/working parties were formed and the- heavy
ground work was commenced* Remmele and 'LLeemAn were in their element, being
in complete charge, they were able to give full expression to their
sadistic natures. The majority of the 550 prisoners who arrived with us
were taken as a working party who had to demolish, and old -building in the
factory plant.. It was very heavy work and beating was the daily order,
even in front of the civilians who worked ‘in the factory. The nan in
charge of this party was a professional German Criminal, who had deserted
from the army-where he -had been an F.0.0. ■ A- small Commando, was. also,
formed consisting; of metal workers and they were sent into the machine
shops, the aim was to enlarge the number to some 1,200 - 1,500 who could
work as specialists in the factory.
First of all the Germans insisted oh building up a "clean-looking" camp -and
of course, as in every concentration camp, wires laden with electricity
/ had﻿- 9 -
*
had. to be installed. Wooden barracks were brought in parts and erected
by the prisoners and the well-known cement pillars for the electric
■ wires and lights were soon built. -after two weeks, an S.S. medical
orderly came to take charge of the "hospital" and health arrangements.
He was a Rumanian from Bessarabia, with a very German sounding name,
Godwinski; he spoke very poor German, but was nevertheless a volunteer
in the S.S* Division Totenkopf. He was one of the few good hearted
S.S. men I ever saw in my whole imprisonment and was, for this reason,
not liked very much by the 3.8. of the real Nazi order, who looked down
on him and who did everything possible to get him into trouble and upset
him. There were some really amazing moments as Godwinski, who had
just c.ome from his three weeks training course for sick bay attendants
in Berlin, tried to correct and order us doctors about; he even
examined the lungs and hearts of every sick prisoner who entered the
hospital. He visited three times daily the "hospital", and was very
bewildered if a man with pneumonia who had been put to bed in the morning
with a temperature of 103, had'not a normal one after about three -or
four hours.
A special man .for liaison work between the management of the armament
factory and the camp was appointed. He selected from the new arrivals
thos most suited for specialist Work, and thos who could do the heavy
work in the camp. He was fifty six,' and a typical Junker of the old
Prussian type, his name was Herr Frenzel, and had been an officer in
the first world war, and appeared to be an intelligent and well-educated
man; he visited the hospital nearly every day to get a wound on his
foot dressed by me, and he was always accompanied by the Camp Leader or
his deputy. He seemed to be very interested in the well-being of
the internees, ,and inspected them regularly asking, in a human way,
questions about all kinds of personal matters. One day he came into
the hospital without an S.S. guard, and began to ask me about the
conditions in concentration camps on the whole. I gave him bluntly
the full information and all 1 knew, ho was shocked and horrified, and
told me he certainly knew some people in high authority in the German
army whom he must tell about 'this. About three days later on another
occasion he briefly told me, there were S.S. present, that he had told
his army friends about what we had discussed. For several weeks I
heard nothing more, and then about three weeks later, Frenzel.brought
two young German civilian workers from the factory into .the camp, and
to our utter amazement started to mal-treat them and use them for "Sport",
shouting at them and kicking them to the great amusement of.the S.S.
These things of course he could only have learnt from watching the S.S.
treatment of us and internees. I would like to state that this was
a tjrpical example of the German mentality, in every single German there
is a cruel and sadistic streak, and when a German comes into.favourable
circumstances, where his-lowest instincts are. allowed freedom, and
these basic characteristics manifest them selves. I have had contact
with nearly every nation and race-on earth but I have never xound
another nationality that possesses- such' a high percentage of cruelty
as the Teutons. ,	'
At this time the German'propaganda machine was working overtime on the
so-called "Katyn" murder of 12,000 Polish officers by the "Russians".
¥e were allowed to have the daily German official newspapers and
followed any information much closer than anybody else. It is really
a most amazing thing to sit in the worst German extermination camp and
read about the horrible crimes committed by other nations knowing
that the German, overran Katin in the late 'summer of*19^-1. It was
definitely a very stupid story and only believed by the fanatical
German population who have very short memories.
We knew of course, by whora these crimes had been committed as we had
seen the neokshot experts Herr Schwartz, Grabner. Aumeier, Palitsch,
and Stiebitz, on the job, several times a week in Block 11.
/ As﻿- 10 - ^
As the epidemic of typhus raged -in the camp, Ors. Entres, Kitt and Rode
and also Dr» Fischer, made dailjr tours of the sick quarters and sent
every man suspected of typhus and of course, otherwise very weak, into
a special room. After the midday interval these men who had been
selected, were collectively led to Block 20 where Obersoharfuhrer
Kl'ehr did his job. These poor creatures were told they were going
to receive an inoculation against typhus and had to lie down on the
operating table; they received a dose of com. of pure phenol
'(carbolic acid) directly into their hearts. Klehr had a very long
routine and according to our estimations, killed about 30,000 by this
method; he averaged about '50 to 100 every afternoon. In case of his
indisposition, there was a very enthusiastic internee'helper, a Pole,
Panczik, with an internee number of 31,000. A friend of mine, Weiss
was his name and he came from Bratislava, had the said job of
assisting also, he had to hold the poor victims down at this massacre.
During working hours the camp leader, Remmele and his deputy often
amused themselves by taking'their half wild alsations to torment the
internees who were doing heavy ground work in the nearby fields, this
they did by throwing the worker's spades some distance and ordering
the worker to run after it, and then setting the dog after him. This
caused them great amusement. Sometimes they selected some already
very weak and elderly.specimen, brought him to the shower baths,
undressed him and gave him changing hot and cold showers as long as
he lived. This-was generally about two hours. Of course during
this piocedure they kicked and beat him which helped to hasten his
death.
There was one particular branch camp at Kobier about 12 miles from
the main Oswiecim Camp where the prisoners were employed felling
trees in the surrounding forest. The commando consisted of about
150 prisoners and was an ME1 Dorado" for the S.S. sharpshooters.
They climbed all over the trees and used the poor workers as human
targets. The daily death.role averaged about five or six not
counting the severely wounded ones. The poor prisoner-doctor had
to make a long medical report stating that each casualty had been
"shot during escape".
The hospital was enlarged by the addition of one room; we had about
50 out-patients every day and we were only allowed to keep 30 inside.
The Camp Leader Remmele, who inspected the hospital every day did not
like sick prisoners at all> his idea was to have two types, Working
ones or dead ones. He studiously asked about every case and I had
to explain thoroughly all. about each man. During this explanation
I always waited apprehensively, scared of being,beaten or kicked;
his speciality was kicking with his high jack—boots.	Nearly every
day there were 5 or 6 septic operations as every little' injury went
septic and infected the rest of the limb. In the one room there
must have been millions of septic germs and in this room I had to
dress clean accident wounds, and perform operations. I was very
lucky in this respect as all my abdominal operations had to be
performed on an ordinary table with improvised instruments, -with
no sterilised gauze, or bandaging, and they all healed without any
septic complications.
Y/henever a major operation had to be performed Remmele came to
watch-and also.the S.S. Kitchen Chief was invited, as it seemed to .
be another occasion for entertainment 'and amusement for them.
/ A new﻿A new sign.of Gexman "culture" appeared in the concentration camps. The S. S.
High Command decided to#establish for the enjoyment of the detainees, of whom
a. very great number, worked, long hours in the German armament industry, brothels
in all the larger camps in Germany. For that purpose the first floor of Block
24 in the main Auschwitz camp was cleared. Half the space was converted into
small rooms which were comfortably furnished with hot and cold water installed,
and the other half was equipped with living and sleeping quarters for the
girls. The 'women were picked from the female camp in Birkenau. Most of them
had been professional prostitutes imprisoned because of their "trade", but
there were many'who were just taken for this work, even young girls of 18-19»
and also there were some who volunteered to come. They were all given good
clothes taken from the .huge stores (Canada) near the crematoriums, and they
were all under the supervision of the SS Camp H. C. 0. Their activity began
after working hours, each prisoner had to pay 2 Reichmarks, from which the
girl received 40 pfennig, the rest went to the paymaster for the upkeep of
the brothel. Each man w.as medically examined before entering this place, each
room had. a number which was given him at the entrance pay box, so naturally
they did not know to. which woman they were going. He was allowed to spend 20
minutes there, after which a bell rang, always there were plenty of SS N.C.Os
on duty watching through the small spy holes in each door. This seemed to
satisfy the abnormal urges of Commander Schwartz and. the SS. After leaving
:each room the men were again examined.
One day at the beginning of July Camp Leader Remmele was transferred to another
camp nearer to Oswiecim where he could be watched more closely beoause there
had. been reports made about his excessive'Way of living by his superiors and
into his place came SS Hauptscharfuehrer GEHRING, another one.of the old
concentration camp specialists, a Weslphalian, originally trained in
SACHSENHAUSEN - ORAEEENBURG, and later a one time block-leader and jailer
of the horror Blook 11. He was a typical Prussian, broad ana heavy with a
square head, and a strict commanding voice. He already knew Bruno from the
old days of Sachsenhausen about 12 years ago and Bruno was very glad to see
him again, and knew that soon the camp would, be under even more strict
supervision.
A week after Bruno had gone, we heard that hi-s diseased mind had at last
given way apd his madness and. insanity had been proved beyond, a shadow of
■doubt.
Three weeks later, we two doctors, and all the others who were with us m the
standing punishment, were sent to'another camp on the order of Commander
Schwartz, and even the intervention of the' SS doctors could, not change the
■order. We were a little frightened that we were being sent to a:worse camp,
if that were possible.
We arrived at Buna camp vdiich contained about 11,000 and was three miles east
of Sschwitz! we seemed to be received very cordially by the Camp Senior Doctor
in charge of the hospital who had already heard about o.ur trouble with Bruno,
whom he knew well enough not to believe his side of the story.	t
50 wooden barracks, and all the prisoners worked on a very large factory plan
belonging to the I.G. PARBEN, whioh had been built up a few years previously
with the lives and. blood of tens of thousands of poor prisoners. Now this
■factory produced synthetic petrol and they Y/ere building workshops for the
production of synthetic rubber and carbide. There were
. employed, the majority of them being slave workers from all- different nuropean
countries, even 450 British Prisoners' of War worked-tWe. Only a very
Germans were employed and naturally they held all the key positions.
The news came that the Russians had broken through 'the German front and
captured CZENST0GH0WA, already north-west of th°position we	^	y
a semi-official order cam through telling us that we would-be moved ^/ithm an
hour. All of us had packed a little bundle and put into it whatever we
possessed, and also we were allowed to take one blanket, which was a lot of
use in that cold freezing.wind.
At B n m the order to form a column came, the-10,0Q0 were prepared in 10 .
groups*, co^anded by th< Ccmp-l.ad.er SS'Obefstuxmfuehrer SOHETTEL. I was m
the﻿- 12 -
the last' medioal group in the rear of the whole column, and was follovelWy
only ope group ..... 15 prostitutes from the camp-brothel.
The sick, weak, injured, and old who were notable to walk were left and one
of the saddest moments of my life arrived as I had to say goodbye to a'number
of my friends who were still my patients. There were.a few cases who were
wreak after operations, akd one who had been a political prisoner.for over 6
years, whose leg had been broken in an air raid.
\ We all told then that they would be all right and tried to comfort them, but
. ev.eiyone knew what would, really -happen to -them. One 46 year old Polish doctor
who had been more than 3 years in Oswieoim with arthritis in his knee was
sent back by Dr. Koenig when we had, mustered. We saw in front of us the most
notorious NCO from Oswiecim SS Hauptscharfuehrer MOLL, a Bavarian butcher by
profession .and also in deeds; he had to clear the rest who- had been left
behind in the camp. Their fate was sealed, as soon as we saw_MOLL. He had
'been in charge of the'gas chambers and the punishment company for,more than
two years, and had killed more than 1-g- million directly and indirectly. 'We
knew that our sick friends would not be left very long to wonder what their
fate was to be.
Yife were marched in our ten groups at a fairly fast rate, on the roads'which
were covered with about 15 inches of snow, we were driven and.shouted at like
erring cattle, by the SS guards, one of whom was marching every ten steps.
Soon, we heard shots being fired, it turned, out to be some prisoner attempting
to escape from the march, h/ one o'clock that night many were exhausted and
had. to be helped by others. The stretchers on wheels which we had managed to
.bring with us, had to be abandoned because of the .deep snow, and we left them
in the ditches. 'Prom another working camp we. were joined by many women.
Apart from feeling very very tired I managed to keep marching at a reasonable
speed. My doctor friend, with whom I had. been for two years, got weaker and.
weaker. I had to try to drag him along supported by two wooden sticks. All
along the lines prisoners dropped on both sides of the road, some died,
immediately from cold and exhaustion, others were shot in the head by Moll,
who was following the column on a motor-cycle, after he had. finished his few
hours "work" at Buna.
At 7 a.m, the next morning we arrived in a very exhausted condition in a small
town of NICOLAI after a march of about 26 miles through deep snow.- There
had been many chances of escape but all of .us were too_ tired and hungry to
arouse .the necessary- energy. Even the well-fed SS guarls sat down completely
exhausted. Some of the high ranking SS were fresh and fit as they had moved
in motor-cars and motor cycles. Our group v/as ordered into a small stable,
and we la}' down on the straw and fell asleep immediately. At 2 p.m. we were
driven put by fresh guards onto the road again. Each stable was searched
and those who were top.-weak to- get up or who had tried, to hide in the straw
i:. were sinply and,,.speedily shot. Marching on again the picture.weht worse
.and,wprse.. Never shall I forget that awful scene. Men in'thin summer'suits,
of:vthe frightful blue' and, white striped cotton, without socks in-wooden clogs,
chafing.their poor feet, dropped off like flies each side of the road, at
■ least one fell every 50 steps, waiting.-for.death in the snow, or death from
the-'Wilds., of Moll who- still followed, us. ;	W
I tcck.ury- fate again ih my hands and tried to escape together with a Polish
friend „iin a forest we passed, as dusk, was beginning to fall and as we were
nearingIthe old. German' -frontier we. decided to make a break for it, a guard
spotted us and called-Us back, and was merciful for some reason or other.
After 2 days' march, and 9 days' train, only 2,000 out.of the original.4*500
- of our group were still more or less alive. It was still bitterly oold and,
heavy snow was falling. People went on dying from starvation and cold.
Upon arrival we had first" of all to be disinfected before we were allowed to
enter the camp^ : Only 45'of us were taken at a time, and. all the o.thers had
to wait in the open. I seemed to be able to hold out.still, although, my
■ strength was quickly giving out, and I realised that it was only the. stronges
who could possibly Survive the next few weeks after these days of starvation,
and the effects of the freezing weather, fatigue, and. general depression.
/ We﻿We waited out there in the snow from 1 "1 a»m. till 10 p.m. At that hour> as
there was no chance of disinfecting us that night, we were taken to a small
block called the quaratine camp. Vtfhat a sight met our eyes. This block 'was
made up of improvised wooden huts, normally for 300 and our group numbering
about 1,800 were pushed in there. There were'no windows, and only a few hewn y
out holes in the walls and ceiling. The crowd of prisoners soon began to get
warm in this crowded atmosphere, and we all began to steam as our clothes were
soaked with the snow, in which we had been standing for so long. Many dropped
down dead and dying. There were sick ones with diarrhoea and all sorts of
very unpleasant complaints. The stench was and is indescribable. On the
few bunks that there were at least 10 would crowd trying to rest their poor
weary, hungry frames. One thing cheered pie us, we received some hot coffee.﻿- 14 -
BUCHENWALD
BUCHEMALD was kno'<7n to us 'as No. 1 Concentration Camp as it had teen tuilt in
peace time and had the reputation amongst the prisoners as being one of the
best camps. Previously when'anyone had been transferred from Auschwitz they
were very-glad to go as they knew .conditions would be better there, but it
was very different now.
Buchenwald had at that time about i'30,000 prisoners, only a small number were
normally in the main camp, the majority were spread over 80 branch'camps, all
being employed by German war industries over middle and western Germany. They
were forced to work in aeroplane factories, small and large arms factories, tank
factories, coal and salt mines, and many bigger branch camps especially in
Thuryca, were specially built so that detainees could be made to work in
underground tunnels and mines or in prepared, mountains, on the German so-called,
secret weapons'. Some poor workers were sent into these underground factories
and never saw the sun again, as they would, never be allowed out alive in case
they gave some of the secrets away. Every 3-4 Weeks the very weak ones who
were still alive- 'in these branch camps were selected out and sent back to
Buchenwald and stronger ones sent to replace them. These weak ones were
considered as new arrivals and kept in the small camp where they were!supposed,
to gain weight and strength, but they were not gassed but just left alone and
allowed to die a natural slow death.
The big camp was occupied by prisoners working in the various administrative
offices, such as the clothing department, camp office, or by mechanics who
worked in the notorious Buchenwald quariya Many of course ’worked as cleaners,
cooks, and batmen for the SS. There was also an optical factory which made
optical instruments, and also there were forest parties who had to obtain fuel
and wood. There was one crematorium for usual use, there ’was also a large
hygienic institute and one isolated "Experimental Block" ’where serum, kerosene
and, other chemical and, bacteriological material was tried on poor human guinea
pigs. Outside the camp was a large riding school, ’which had. been turned, into
a place for the disposal of any anti-Hitler officers and high-ranking_Germans.
They were liquidated by the neck-shot during a faked medical examination,
which I heard was carried out as follows. Each was undressed and weighed, and
asked to stand by a wall to be measured in height, and were shot unexpectedly
through a small hole in the wall.
The sick bay attendant was a Polish German from Danzig, previously an NCO m
the Polish Army, he had volunteered for the SS after the Geraian occupation.
There were over 1,800 prisoners eriployed in the erection of an underground
factory in the mountainside nearby. It was to be used for the production o
synthetic petrol. 15 tunnels were made by drilling machines and dynamite.
The ventilation was very poor, and the prisoners had. to load, the rocks and
soil that were being removed from the tunnels on to little trucks, which
conveyed the soil etc. to the outside of the tunnels. It was very heavy work,
particularly as the prisoners only received 250 grammes of bread a day, which
amounts to about three slices. They were also allowed one pint of Wcter-
tumip soup and on this diet they had, toTOrk 17 hours daily. Of course they
Were driven and beaten at their work to encourage them to work faster.
The whole camp was full of lice and there was no washing facilities and for
a few months no fumigating installation, so naturally the lice increased until
we had literally millions of them. Fortunately there was no typhus. The bb
FUEHRUNGSTAB (SS directing staff) pressed, for speed in the erection of the
factory, and. the Commanding SS Officer, an old-time brutal Nazi; HACK, ^ e
to extreme measures to get the job finished as there only existed, ree o cr
main factories in the whole of Germany for the production of synthetic petrol,
and two were already in Russian hands. So there was plenty of work to o,
and it seemed that there was an abundance of material and tools. The daw
death roll was at least 11, and a fit man normally could, last about 3-5 weeks.
Here I saw for the first time prisoners of war in the same condition as
concentration camp internees. There was one working group of_j50 U.S.A.
prisoners of war, who had been captured only a few weeks previously in
/ Runstedf s
%﻿- 15
♦
Runstedt's Xmas offensive. They received the same food as our fellows, cooked
for them in the kitchen of the concentration camp. Being new prisoners they
had no Red Cross parcels, and after a month 1+0 had died from malnutrition
and diarrhoea. They too .were covered with lice.
The hospital, if one can call it such, was in a terrible condition. There
was only one room with about 25 bunks, practically no instruments or medicaments;
the. latter we had to beg for from the local dispensary. Thank God. I was only
there for three weeks, because under those conditions ho one on earth could
hope to practise as a doctor. I could give little or no help to my patients,
and my only work seemed to be the signing of death certificates. There was
also a few Hungarian doctors, who had, no experience of concentration camps and
felt entirely useless and hopeless.
I was able to take the plaoe of a Polish doctor who Was in very bad health,
but I must say that even with the best intentions in the world, and the
strongest will I could not improve the conditions to any great extent. The
material was inadequate and the odds against me. There were daily 4OO-5OO
on sick parade and I, Was- only allowed to keep 80 from their work.

1.	The existence and movement of a B.M., unlike those of a registered file, are NO F recorded
by Registry.
2.	B.Ms. may ONLY be used as :—
(a) ENCLOSURE B.Ms.—For action on letters or other important papers when the appro-
priate registered file is not available. When it is essential for a branch to obtain
quickly the views of a number of other branches, and these branches are not likely
to need to refer to the file in order to formulate their views, it is often appropriate
to send “ Enclosure B.Ms.” simultaneously to each such branch. Enclosure B.Ms.,
or the substance of them, must be enclosed in the registered file at the first opportunity.
{b) INTERNAL DISCUSSION B.Ms.—For “ domestic ” records or discussions within a
directorate, etc. ; or for other preliminary soundings on any questions which may or
may not at a later stage require a registered file.
(c) COVERS FOR UNIMPORTANT LETTERS, ETC.—B.M. covers may be used when a
jacket is essential for unregistered correspondence unlikely to involve much inter-
branch discussion.
3.	If a B.M. has, or acquires, any general importance, the branch concerned should link the
B.M. to a registered file at the earliest possible moment in one of the following ways :—
(a)	By sending the complete B.M. to be registered and thus raised to the status of a registered
file ;
(b)	By transferring the B.M. as an enclosure to a registered file.

﻿I have just returned to England via Sierra Leone, Durban and the concen-
tration camps of Oswiecim and Buchenwald.. I am a Czech physician and I was captured
by the Germans in the Indian Ocean after I had escaped from them to England via
Poland. I know this sounds a strange itinerary, and today it seems almost incredible
to me, but it all happened.
I escaped into Poland after the March occupation of Czechoslovakia in
19:59. I got to England, and after the outbreak of war volunteered for service with
the British Merchant Navy. In September 1940 I sailed from Liverpool as ship’s
surgeon to the S.S. "Automedon'1. The "Automedon" was sunk by the German merchant
raider, "Atlantis" off the Malayen island of Penang. Some of my ship-mates yrere
killed, but most of than were taken prisoner. The secret documents fell into the
enemy's hands, amongst them the "crew list"; against my name stood the word
’Czechoslovak". For this reason, after we were landed in Germany I was eventually
removed from my British friends in the P.OfvT. camp "Marlag und Milag Nord", to first
one and then on to other concentration camps. I was considered by the Gestapo as a
traitor to the '’German Reich"; as one, who had treacherously taken up arms against
its interests. My arms were some surgical instruments and medical books. But that
was enough for the defenders of the Great Germany.
I hear you saying "We know, what is coming now, we have all heard about it
and. read about it, Oswiecim, Buchenvald are known to us; we have seen photographs
and movies; we have been sick, horrified and depressed. We lost a night's sleep
after seeing the news-reel about Belsen, he cannot tell us anything new ....."
You are tempted to lay down the paper and read something more pleasant, perhaps
something more exciting, real "hot-stuff" ..........
But I am not going to tell you of the gas chambers and incinerators of
■Qswiecim or of the four million human beings who went to their death whilst I was
there, I am not going to give you details of mass executions, by hangings and
shooting •which I was forced to witness. I will not enumerate the corpses which I
had to carry from gallows and execution ranges to the pits. Since I returned to
the civilised world, I have read every available line published about German con-
centration camps. I believe too that perhaps you have had enough ot if.
But there is something which has not yet been described in detail, some-
thing which I have seen more intimately than any other prisoner, something which has
to be written once. I am going to tell you of the German Medical Officers in the
concentration camps.
I am a doctor myself. I studied at Prague and at the German University of
Vienna. Together with six German candidates I took the oath of Hippocrates. ¥e all
promised to help the suffering and aid the weak. Many times I heard German Profes-
sors say to their German students "Let this be your guiding principle - Nil Nocere -
Never do harm to your patient". The students listened carefully to these ’words of
High authority but in a few years some of them became officers of concentration
camps.
I remember a big sign on the front wall of one of our class-rooms at a
German clinic, "ONLY A GOOD MAN GAN BE A GOOD PHYSIO IAN". These were the words of
Theodor Billroth, one of the greatest surgeons in Germany, and of world-wide repute.
A good many of the concentration camp doctors must have seen these words. Perhaps
even S.S. Standartenfuhrer MUDr. Lolling, medical officer in charge of all
concentration camps.
He arrived in Oswiecim one day in April 1943 and condescendingly informed
us prison doctors, there were hundreds of us, that he was going to establish'an
experimental physiological-pathological station at the camp. Tfe were even told that
four German Universities wich such a famous medical tradition as Heidelberg, Munich,
Berlin and Kocnigsberg, would participate in the large scale scientific work.
As medical graduates we were driven to clean a "Block" (barracks) with
water, disinfectants, brooms and brushes, certainly we must share in the scientific
work.
t﻿Page 2
The following morning the first "patients" arrived, mostly Jewish women
from Holland. Old and young, some over sixty and some barely seventeen. They were
well, even expensively dressed. There were a few expectant mothers amongst them.
They were marched in by S.S. women - you have seen their type in the pictures from
Belsen. Whips, pistols and bloodhounds - nothing was missing. They were followed
by S.S. Hauptsturmfuhrer Schwartz commanding a few very young S.S. men. Herr
Schwartz should have felt slightly uneasy amongst so many academic men. Not so
long ago he had been a horse-groom in Bavarian stables, but it was he who gave the
orders.
The women were forcibly undressed, while the shouting S.S. guards
maltreated them. Then their heads and bodies were shaved by the five nurses. They
did a thorough job - behind them stood the young S.S. men jeering and laughing at
the spectacle. You may have seen undressed dummies in the shop-windows and stores;
they have at least artificial hair on their heads.
Would you, young men from New York or Texas, feel ashamed and embarrassed
if you had to handle,these naked bodies in public? You probably would. But we
doctors, to whom a naked body is no embarrassment, were upset when we had to map
a greasy delousing cream all over the poor bodies of Professor Claubcrg’s experi-
mental material. The S.S. Men made sure that we did not miss a single spot. Of
course these bodies were not dummies they belonged to screaming, living women, they
could have been ora’ mothers and sisters.
Perhaps you, who still cannot believe that even a German can sink so low,
will take some comfort in the fact that all these women were given some old Russian
uniforms and very small coloured kerchiefs for their greasy, bald, heads, when we
had done with them. But our task was not quite finished yet. We had to collect
the hair from the floor of the "Institute” and put it into boxes. It went to
Germany, was worked into mattresses and the good "Burgers" of the Reich, who never
knew what was going on in the concentration camps, as we heard so recently, slept
on them with undisturbed conscience.
The Director of the physiological-pathological experiments. Professor
Glauberg had no share in these pure preliminaries, which did not necessitate.the
presence of a skilled scientific mind. Herr Schwartz could see to that. Faithful
to the tradition of Koch, Billroth, and Virehow the Professor buried himself with
typical German scientific thoroughness in the elaborate preparation of his
experiments. There was much to plan and there were difficult problems ahead. Male
specimens had to be selected from an adjoining camp (Birkenau); their semen °°^-d
be used for artificial insemination. Assistants had to be found and the msual-ation
of a huge X-ray apparatus had to be supervised. But the Professor knew that, the name
and honour of German science was at stake and he cleared all obstacles from his path.
In two days he was ready.
Some of the now half-crazy women were put on the operation table and arti
ficially inseminated. Others were exposed to damaging doses of X-rays until their
ovaries became sterile. To make sure that his experiments were successful the Herr
Professor extirpated the ovaries by an abdominal operation and had them examined
under the best microscopes German science is able to produce.
While Herr Clauberg was busy with the ovaries, a congenial scientist in
uniform, the twenty—nine years old Herr Oberleutant der Luftwaffe Dr, Kaufmann did
his share with the testicles. He had a wide choice of young men in oar camps,
selected some convenient specimens, applied different, fine-measured dosages of
X-rays to their testicles, removed them later by operation, and had them microscoped.
But German scientific work is always team-work and the Herr Professor and the.Herr
Oberleunant were German scientists. They showed great interest in the possibility
of survival of sexual urges in castrated men and sterilised women. .They did not
shirk from the final experiment, which could only give value to their "quod est .
demonstrandum". So they had a castrated male specimen and a sterile female specimen
undressed and put together in a tiny room. Through a spy-hole in the door the
zealous, objective scientists watched what would happen. They seemed satisfied witn
their observations.
With pregnant vromen the actual confinement was performed lege
photographed and filmed by Dr. Entres the Medical Superintendent of the
camp Oswiecim and his assistant Dr. Mengele.
artis and
concentration﻿Films have been made in the teaching schools of the free peoples of the
world for the purposes of training midwives and medical students, but at Oswiecim
mother and child were doing fine'1 only a very short time. The experiment was
ended and the two lives were destroyed in the gas chambers. Why feed useless mouths?
A scientist like Professor Clauberg, conscious of his responsibilities to
suffering mankind could not leave the cancer problem untackled. By a skillful
operation he incised the wombs of healthy young women and implanted cancer cells and
cancer tissues into them. Then patient as German scientists are known to be, he
waited weeks and weeks before he removed the whole womb to see what had happened to
his cancer cells.
All this meant hard and intensive work for Professor Glauberg, Oberleutant
Kaufmann and even layman Schwarts. Their programme became soon so overwhelming that
they had to look for helpers amongst us despised doctor-prisoners. A Jewish-German
Professor from Frankfurt a M. Dr. Salomon, who in his better times had brought many
German babies including future S.S. men into the world, had to perform many opera-
tions for Clauberg. A lady doctor from Prague, Dora Klein, a former Medical Officer
of the International Brigade in Spain, was forced to assist him. Another prisoner
a Pole, Dr, Bering from Warsaw, became so infected by the scientific zeal of his
German bosses that he soon became quite independent and started to perform operations
on his own initiative. He got his reward: he ms released and became assistant at
Professor Clauberg’s private clinic.
To the best of my knowledge the findings of the Oswiecim experiments were
never published. Their secrets are still with Professor Clauberg, T have been
assured by high authority that little could have been revealed by them which has
not already been proved by animal experiments which sometimes so profoundly shock
various "Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals". That is for the
medical authorities to decide.
But something I do know; after the inmates of the experimental station had
served their purpose they were blessed with the mercy of a quick death by cyanide gas
in the gas chambers of Birkenau.
I have written this account not only for your enlightment but also for my
own sake. Somehow I have managed to survive all the horrors and now for some weeks
I have been back in the civilised world. One can barely live with such knowledge;
one cannot escape from it but to some degree at least, one can share it, I feel
better now.
Finally, I will return to Theodor Billroth’s words "only a good man can be
a good Physician,t. It does not necessarily follow that all doctors are good men but
normally most strive to be so, though all professions have their weaklings. Never-
theless, from the earliest times the problems of pain and sickness have challenged
the thought and faith of humanity, and have attracted the study of well-intended men.
Consciously and subconsciously millions of sick and ailing have believed in such men
and turned to them for help. But in the New Nazi Germany the finest arts and
sciences have been prostituted and medicine debased. Kindly physicians in the quiet
of their wholesome homes, and benevolent psychologists in the caliu'atmosphere of
their studies may pick up this essentially lay article and may say, "poor fellow this
writer, he has had a bad time, but why does he exaggerate and excite such horror".
Others may say "but It is not possible, surely Professor Clauberg and the
other German doctors are physicians x^ho graduated in the noble art of healing, they
could not have done such things."
There is a tradition that doctors do not readily let each other down. But
God forbid that, as the concentration camps fade into oblivion and the doctors of the
world meet again to exchange ideas and discoveries at international conferences, any
surgeon or physician should say of the German doctors of the German concentration
camps: "After all these men are scientists, men like us, and we must sit next to
them and exchange ideas with them if medical science is not to suffer or perish".
To those who forgive and forget too quickly I dedicate these lines.

Killing of Cpl. REYNOLES and wounding of Pte. CAMPBELL.
GENERAL NARRATIVE:
Unteroffizier Benno FRANZ shot and killed REYNOLDS with his
revolver when a party of prisoners of which REYNOLDS was a member refused to
work because of dangerous weather conditions and lack of proper equipment.
The accused also stabbed Pte. CAMPBELL in the back whilst the latter was
assisting a Polish girl to carry a pail of soup from the cookhouse. The
killing of Cpl. REYNOLDS took place at the IG Farben Chemical Works at
AUSCHWITZ where the party was employed on constructional work. Dr. HEINRICH
was employed at the factory and was responsible, among other things, for the
provision of safety belts for men employed on overhead constructional work.
A POW, Lothar Kurt Gotthold HEINRICH was detained at Intern-
immt Camp No 78, Zuffenhausen. (We understand this camp is closing down and
the internees may have been sent elsewhere). It is possible that this man
may be identical to the Dr. HEINRICH referred to above. The following is the
description of Dr. HEINRICH:
Civilian occupation - Chemist employed by IG Farben; aged
about 50; weight about 11-12 stone; height about 5'll"; ^ark hair, going
crey and worn closely cropped; wears glasses; pale complexion; speaks
English; probably married; member of the Nazi party; a typical research
chemist.
IIS TRUCTIPI'S TO INTERROGATOR:
To interrogate Lothar Kurt Gotthold HEINRICH to discover
whether he was employed at IG Farben Chemical Works at
and if so whether he can give any information which would be of assistance
in tracing the accused Benno FRANZ.

1.	Prom the above-quoted letter, it is not immediately
apparent what type of investigation is required by this HQ.
2.	If interrogation of his wife and brother are required,
it is assumed that confirmation of his employment by the IG
FARBENINDUSTRIE and alter at AUSCHWITZ is required. Whether this
information will be readily available from these sources is doubtful,
in view of his own reticence. Files on the IG FARBENINDUSTRIE
however, are held at this HQ., but since they are comprehensive, it
would be appreciated if information concerning his status, location
and branch could be forwarded to this HQ., thus enabling a careful
check to be made; confirmation might also be obtAned from other
employees now interned, who may have worked in the same department.
Similarly, it is suggested that confirmation of his
enployment at AUSCHWITZ may be obtained from ex AUSCHWITZ personnel.
If you have records of personnel interned in C.I.C.'s who fall into
this category, interrogation on this point can be made at your
request.

obviously does not intend to be concerned with any war crimes

With reference to your memorandum BAOR/WC/G 260
undated,and received on 11th March,1947, it has not been possible
to identify the ex prisoner of war. Private Campbell in question,
as there were numerous prisoners of this surname in Stalag VEII BJ
we have however, found in our records two extracts from
ouestionnaires completed by repatriated prisoners of war from
Europe relative to the shooting of T/183224 Corporal L.V. Reynolds,
Royal Army Service Corps. Copies are attached for your information
It is suggested that either of these ex prisoners of war might
be able to help you in the matter.
The identification of W.O.I Bester is No.l4722,W.0.I,
M.E. Bester,South African Forces. It has been ascertained^ from
the South African Authorities in London that he was repatriated
to South Africa on the 25th May 1945 and that any communications
intended for him should be addressed 0/o.,The Adjutant General
War Records, Hamilton Street, Pretoria, South Africa.
It has been ascertained from Royal Artillery Records,
that No.927851 Gunner J.O. King, was released from tire Forces on

1)	.	This case has been held open by this section in a
oe ,4ing state for some time. The position at the moment is
that a reply is awaited from LONDON as to whether Private
CAMPBELL recognises the photographs of Lol. /, Kurt Gottne^u
HEINRICH dispatched by you on 8 Hay 47. Although = ... lilOii
denies any knowledge of the case or even of haying been in
Camp E715 it is, as you agree, striking that the m*n 3 names
corresoond exactly to those of the HEINRICH given in your
Brief/ He still persists, however, after several interrogat o
in his denial of knowledge of the camp .or the accused Bcnno_
wranz. He himself is presumably not an accused but is merely
•anted to help in tracing FRANZ. Even if it is proved that
he is the man you mention in the Brief there is no guaran.ee
that the required inform tion can be extracted from him even
if it is not accepted that he is telling the truth when ho
states that h does not know FRA Z.

Unteroffizier Benno FRAflZ
VICTIMS:-
Opl. REYNOLDS and Pte. C&IPBBSLL
PLACE:-
Working camp E. 715 at AUSCHWITZ;
BATS:-
1944
TYPE OP OFFENCE:-
Killing of Cpl. REYNOLDS and wounding of
Pte. CAMPBELL.
GENERAL NARRATIVE:
1
Unteroffizier Benno FRANZ shot and killed REYNOLDS with his
revolver Then a party of prisoners of which REYNOLDS was ameraber refused
to work because of dangerous weather conditions and lack of proper-
equipment. T e accused also stabbed Pte. GAMPBEEL in the bade whilst -the
latter was assisting a Polish girl to carry a pail of soup from the
cookhouse. The killing of Cpl. REYNOLDS took place at the IG Farben
Cehmical Tforks at AUSCHWITZ where the party was employed on constructional
work. Dr. HEINRICH was employed at the factory and was responsible, among
other things, fer the provision of safety belts fisor men employed on
overhead constructional work.
-sC
_AJP0W, Lothar Kurt Gotthold HEINRICH was detained at
hternment Camp llbT^78, ZPFFENHAUSEN. (We understand this camp is closirig
down and the internees may have been sent elsewhere). It is possible tha-J;
this mand may be identical to the Er. HEINRICH referred to above. The
•following is the description of Dr. HEINRICH :-
Civilian occupation - Chemist employed by IG Farben; aged
about 50, wieght about 11-12 stones; height about S’ll" ; dark hair,
geing grey and worn closely cropped; wears glasses; pale complerfcion;
speaks English; probably married; member of the Nazi party; a typical
research chemist.
INSTRUCTIONS SO INTERROGATOR: -
To interrogate Lothkr Kurt Gotthold HEINRICH to di.soover
whether he was employed at IG Farben Chemical ’Works at AUSCHWITZ in 1944,
and if so whether he can be give any information which would be of
assistance in tracing Ihe accused Benno FRANZ.

Gefreiter Benno (or Beno) FRANZ
1.	I received WD AGO Form 19-3 in respect of the above-
mentioned German prisoner of war from the American P.W.I.B.
under reference TPM 383*6 dated 26 July, 1946, a.s a result
of a wanted list.
2.	On the Form appeared the following; "Transf to
Jugosl R 745, 6 Aug 45". I took this to mean that FRANZ
had been transferred to Yugoslavia, but as you will see
from the enclosed copv letter from the Yugoslav Reporesenta-
tive on U.N.V/.C.C., this does not appear likely. I under-
stand that there are certain Yugoslav camps in Germany, and
it now seems to me that the camp referred to may be one of
these.
3.	If FRANZ is confined in a Yugoslav camp in the
American Zone I shall be grateful if he can be interrogated
with a vie?r to' ascertaining whether he was a member of the
camp staff at Working Camp E 715 at AUSCHWITZ in February
1944. If this proves to be the case I shall then arrange
for him to be transferred to the London District Cage for a
more thorough interrogation as he.is ahnost certain to
be the man Wanted as the accused in this case.
4.	If, on the other hand, my original idea that^FRANZ
had been transferred to Yugoslavia is.correct, it would be
appreciated if you could furnish me with any 01 the inform-
ation asked for in the enclosed letter from the Yugoslav
